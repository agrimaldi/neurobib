TI Regulation of human Cripto-1 expression by nuclear receptors and DNA
   promoter methylation in human embryonal and breast cancer cells
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Human Cripto-1 (CR-1) plays an important role in regulating embryonic
   development while also regulating various stages of tumor progression.
   However, mechanisms that regulate CR-1 expression during embryogenesis
   and tumorigenesis are still not well defined. In the present study, we
   investigated the effects of two nuclear receptors, liver receptor
   homolog (LRH)-1 and germ cell nuclear factor receptor (GCNF) and
   epigenetic modifications on CR-1 gene expression in NTERA-2 human
   embryonal carcinoma cells and in breast cancer cells. CR-1 expression in
   NTERA-2 cells was positively regulated by LRH-1 through direct binding
   to a DR0 element within the CR-1 promoter, while GCNF strongly
   suppressed CR-1 expression in these cells. In addition, the CR-1
   promoter was unmethylated in NTERA-2 cells, while T47D, ZR75-1, and MCF7
   breast cancer cells showed high levels of CR-1 promoter methylation and
   low CR-1 mRNA and protein expression. Treatment of breast cancer cells
   with a demethylating agent and histone deacetylase inhibitors reduced
   methylation of the CR-1 promoter and reactivated CR-1 mRNA and protein
   expression in these cells, promoting migration and invasion of breast
   cancer cells. Analysis of a breast cancer tissue array revealed that
   CR-1 was highly expressed in the majority of human breast tumors,
   suggesting that CR-1 expression in breast cancer cell lines might not be
   representative of in vivo expression. Collectively, these findings offer
   some insight into the transcriptional regulation of CR-1 gene expression
   and its critical role in the pathogenesis of human cancer. J. Cell.

TI Different methylation and MicroRNA expression pattern in male and female
   familial breast cancer
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Epigenetic regulation, has been very scarcely explored in familial
   breast cancer (BC). In the present study RASSF1A and RAR beta promoter
   methylation and miR17, miR21, miR 124, and let-7a expression were
   investigated to highlight possible differences of epigenetic regulation
   between male and female familial BC, also in comparison with sporadic
   BC. These epigenetic alterations were studied in 56 familial BC patients
   (27 males and 29 females) and in 16 female sporadic cases. RASSF1A
   resulted more frequently methylated in men than women (76% vs. 28%,
   respectively, P=0.0001), while miR17 and let-7a expression frequency was
   higher in women than in men (miR17: 66% in women vs. 41% in men, P<0.05;
   let-7a: 45% in women vs. 15% in men, P=0.015). RASSF1A methylation
   affected 27.6% of familial BC while 83% of familial cases showed high
   expression of the gene (P=0.025); on the contrary, only 17% of familial
   BC presented RAR beta methylation and 55% of familial cases
   overexpressed this gene (P=0.005). Moreover, miR17, miR21, and let-7a
   resulted significantly overexpressed in familial compared to sporadic
   BC. RASSF1A overexpression (86% vs. 65%, P=0.13) and RAR beta
   overexpression (57% vs. 32%, P=0.11) were higher in BRCA1/2 carriers
   even if not statistical significance was reached. BRCA mutation carriers
   also demonstrated significant overexpression of: miR17 (93% vs. 35%,
   P=0.0001), let-7a (64% vs. 16%, P=0.002), and of miR21 (100% vs. 65%,
   P=0.008). In conclusion, the present data suggest the involvement of
   RASSF1A in familial male BC, while miR17 and let-7a seem to be implied
   in familial female BC. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 12641269, 2013. (c) 2012

TI Non-CpG island promoter hypomethylation and miR-149 regulate the
   expression of SRPX2 in colorectal cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Gene silencing by DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is a
   well-characterized phenomenon in cancer. The effect of hypomethylation
   in particular of non-CpG island genes is much less well described. By
   genome-wide screening, we identified 105 genes in microsatellite stable
   (MSS) colorectal adenocarcinomas with an inverse correlation (Spearman's
   0.40) between methylation and expression. Of these, 35 (33%) were
   hypomethylated non-CpG island genes and two of them, APOLD1 (Spearman's
   = 0.82) and SRPX2 (Spearman's = 0.80) were selected for further
   analyses. Hypomethylation of both genes were localized events not shared
   by adjacent genes. A set of 662 FFPE DNA samples not only confirmed that
   APOLD1 and SRPX2 are hypomethylated in CRC but also revealed
   hypomethylation to be significantly (p < 0.01) associated with tumors
   being localized in the left side, CpG island methylator phenotype
   negative, MSS, BRAF wt, undifferentiated and of adenocarcinoma
   histosubtype. Demethylation experiments supported SRPX2 being
   epigenetically regulated via DNA methylation, whereas other mechanisms
   in addition to DNA methylation seem to be involved in the regulation of
   APOLD1. We further identified miR-149 as a potential novel
   post-transcriptional regulator of SRPX2. In carcinoma tissue, miR-149
   was downregulated and inversely correlated to SRPX2 ( = 0.77).
   Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-149 significantly reduced SRPX2
   transcript levels. Our study highlights that in colorectal tumors,
   hypomethylation of non-CpG island-associated promoters deregulate gene
   expression nearly as frequent as do CpG-island hypermethylation. The
   hypomethylation of SRPX2 is focal and not part of a large block.
   Furthermore, it often translates to an increased expression level, which
   may be modulated by miR-149.

TI Stress hormones mediate predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in
   amphibian tadpoles
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Amphibian tadpoles display extensive anti-predator phenotypic
   plasticity, reducing locomotory activity and, with chronic predator
   exposure, developing relatively smaller trunks and larger tails. In many
   vertebrates, predator exposure alters activity of the neuroendocrine
   stress axis. We investigated predator-induced effects on stress hormone
   production and the mechanistic link to anti-predator defences in Rana
   sylvatica tadpoles. Whole-body corticosterone (CORT) content was
   positively correlated with predator biomass in natural ponds. Exposure
   to caged predators in mesocosms caused a reduction in CORT by 4 hours,
   but increased CORT after 4 days. Tadpoles chronically exposed to
   exogenous CORT developed larger tails relative to their trunks, matching
   morphological changes induced by predator chemical cue; this predator
   effect was blocked by the corticosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor
   metyrapone. Tadpole tail explants treated in vitro with CORT increased
   tissue weight, suggesting that CORT acts directly on the tail.
   Short-term treatment of tadpoles with CORT increased predation
   mortality, likely due to increased locomotory activity. However,
   long-term CORT treatment enhanced survivorship, likely due to induced
   morphology. Our findings support the hypothesis that tadpole
   physiological and behavioural/morphological responses to predation are
   causally interrelated. Tadpoles initially suppress CORT and behaviour to
   avoid capture, but increase CORT with longer exposure, inducing adaptive
   phenotypic changes.

TI The role of the nucleosome acidic patch in modulating higher order
   chromatin structure
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Higher order folding of chromatin fibre is mediated by interactions of
   the histone H4 N-terminal tail domains with neighbouring nucleosomes.
   Mechanistically, the H4 tails of one nucleosome bind to the acidic patch
   region on the surface of adjacent nucleosomes, causing fibre compaction.
   The functionality of the chromatin fibre can be modified by proteins
   that interact with the nucleosome. The co-structures of five different
   proteins with the nucleosome (LANA, IL-33, RCC1, Sir3 and HMGN2)
   recently have been examined by experimental and computational studies.
   Interestingly, each of these proteins displays steric, ionic and
   hydrogen bond complementarity with the acidic patch, and therefore will
   compete with each other for binding to the nucleosome. We first review
   the molecular details of each interface, focusing on the key
   non-covalent interactions that stabilize the protein-acidic patch
   interactions. We then propose a model in which binding of proteins to
   the nucleosome disrupts interaction of the H4 tail domains with the
   acidic patch, preventing the intrinsic chromatin folding pathway and
   leading to assembly of alternative higher order chromatin structures
   with unique biological functions.

TI Screening for differentially methylated genes among human colorectal
   cancer tissues and normal mucosa by microarray chip
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB High density DNA methylation microarrays were used to study the
   differences of gene methylation level in six pairs of colorectal cancer
   (CRC) and adjacent normal mucosa. We analyzed the profile of methylated
   genes by NimbleGen Microarray and the biologic functions by NIH-NAVID.
   In addition, preliminary validation studies were done in six pairs of
   samples by MSP (methylation-specific PCR). A total of 4,644 genes had a
   difference in methylation levels. Among them 2,296 were hypermethylated
   (log2ratio > 1), 2,348 genes were hypomethylated (log2ratio < -1), in
   which 293 hypermethylated and 313 hypomethylated genes were unmapped
   according to the NIH-NAVID. All these genes were randomly distributed on
   all the chromosomes. However, chromosome 1 contained the most of the
   hypermethylated genes (232 genes), followed by chromosome 19 (149
   genes), chromosome 11 (144 genes), chromosome 2 (141 genes), chromosomes
   3 (127 genes). Through the analysis of the statistics, There were 2
   hypermethylated/3 hypomethylated genes involved in six pairs of samples
   simultaneously, followed by 10/14 in five samples, 34/37 in four
   samples, 101/113 in three samples, 341/377 in two samples, 1,808/1,804
   in one sample. According to gene ontology analysis, some physiological
   processes play important roles in the cell division and the development
   of tumor, such as apoptosis, DNA repair, immune, cell cycle, cell cycle
   checkpoint, cell adhesion and invasion etc. Through Preliminary
   validation, there were two genes (St3gal6, Opcml) in thirty top-ranking
   genes shown hypermethylated in six pairs of CRC and adjacent normal
   mucosa. Conclusions High density DNA methylation microarrays is an
   effective method for screening aberrantly methylated genes in CRC. The
   methylated genes should be further studied for diagnostic or prognostic
   markers for CRC.

TI A role for anterior thalamic nuclei in affective cognition: Interaction
   with environmental conditions
SO HIPPOCAMPUS
AB Damage to anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) is a well-known cause of
   diencephalic pathology that produces a range of cognitive deficits
   reminiscent of a hippocampal syndrome. Anatomical connections of the ATN
   also extend to cerebral areas that support affective cognition. Enriched
   environments promote recovery of declarative/relational memory after ATN
   lesions and are known to downregulate emotional behaviors. Hence, the
   performance of standard-housed and enriched ATN rats in a range of
   behavioral tasks engaging affective cognition was compared. ATN rats
   exhibited reduced anxiety responses in the elevated plus maze, increased
   activity and reduced corticosterone responses when exploring an open
   field, and delayed acquisition of a conditioned contextual fear
   response. ATN rats also exhibited reduced c-Fos and phosphorylated cAMP
   response element-binding protein (pCREB) immunoreactivity in the
   hippocampal formation and the amygdala after completion of the
   contextual fear test. Marked c-Fos hypoactivity and reduced pCREB levels
   were also evident in the granular retrosplenial cortex and, to a lesser
   extent, in the anterior cingulate cortex. Unlike standard-housed ATN
   rats, enriched ATN rats expressed virtually no fear of the conditioned
   context. These results show that the ATN regulate affective cognition
   and that damage to this region may produce markedly different behavioral
   effects as a function of environmental housing conditions. (c) 2013

TI Methylation and microsatellite status and recurrence following adjuvant
   FOLFOX in colorectal cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB The prognostic impact of CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and
   microsatellite instability (MSI) on the treatment outcome of colon
   cancer patients receiving adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin
   (FOLFOX) is unclear. We investigated CIMP and MSI status in colorectal
   cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX. Stages II and III sporadic
   colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection followed by
   adjuvant FOLFOX were included. Eight CpG island loci (CACNA1G, CRABP1,
   IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CDKN2A (p16), RUNX3 and SOCS1) and five
   microsatellite markers were examined. Disease-free survival (DFS) was
   analyzed according to CIMP and MSI status. A total of 322 patients were
   included: male/female 192/130, median age 61 years (range 3078),
   proximal/distal location 118/204 and Stages II/III 43/279. CIMP status
   was high in 25 patients (7.8%) and 21 patients (6.5%) had MSI-high
   tumor. CIMP/MSI status was not significantly associated with DFS: 3-year
   DFS 100% in CIMP()/MSI(+), 84% in CIMP()/MSI(), 82% in CIMP(+)/MSI() and
   75% in CIMP(+)/MSI(+) (p = 0.33). Results of exploratory analysis showed
   that concurrent methylation at NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) was associated
   with shorter DFS: 3-year DFS 69% in NEUROG1(+)/CDKN2A (p16)(+) versus
   87% in NEUROG1()/CDKN2A (p16)() (p = 0.006). In conclusion, concurrent
   methylation of NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) is associated with recurrence
   following adjuvant FOLFOX in Stages II/III colorectal cancer.

TI Risk factors for sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
AB Medullary thyroid cancer is a rare tumour that appears in two distinct
   forms. The rarer familial form is genetically determined. The sporadic
   form is more common, but its aetiology has not been defined clearly so
   far. The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors for
   development of sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (sMTC). A case-control
   study was carried out during the period 2000-2009. The case group
   included 98 consecutive patients with sMTC. The control group comprised
   twice as many cases (196), who were neighbours of the patients from the
   case group. Patients were individually matched by sex, age and place of
   residence. Conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression
   methods were applied in data analyses. According to the univariate
   logistic regression method, sMTC was significantly related to smoking
   status, duration of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day,
   personal history of goitre or thyroid nodules, personal history of
   nonthyroid cancer, menarche after 14 years of age, first full-term
   pregnancy before 20 years of age and usage of oral contraceptives.
   According to the multivariate logistic regression method, sMTC was
   independently related to smoking status [odds ratio (OR)= 0.46, 95%
   confidence interval (CI) = 0.20-0.90], personal history of goitre or
   thyroid nodules (OR = 11.29, 95% CI = 1.16-73.45) and menarche after 14
   years of age (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.33-6.28). Risk factors for sMTC were
   goitre or thyroid nodules and late menarche; cigarette smoking appeared
   to be a protective factor. European Journal of Cancer Prevention

TI Postnatal maternal deprivation and pubertal stress have additive effects
   on dopamine D2 receptor and CaMKII beta expression in the striatum
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB The goal of this study was to determine whether two stressors commonly
   used to model aspects of neuropsychiatric disease in rats have an
   additive effect on striatal dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) expression, a
   key player in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disease.
   Animals subjected to early postnatal stress show alterations in function
   of the dopaminergic system thought to be mediated by stress-induced
   glucocorticoid release. Subsequent stress during puberty is known to
   further impact the dopaminergic system and result in dopaminergic
   hyperactivity analogous to schizophrenia.
   We exposed rats to maternal deprivation (MD) during the second postnatal
   week, a time of active striatal development. A subset of these animals
   were then subjected to pubertal stress induced by immobilization. Both
   procedures are know to induce glucocorticoid release.
   At the conclusion of the MD protocol, we observed upregulation in the
   expression of D2R and of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein
   32-KD (DARPP-32; PPP1R1B), but not of D1R, calcium/calmodulin-dependent
   protein kinase II beta (CaMKII beta), CaMKII alpha or neurokinin B
   (NKB).
   Animals exposed to pubertal stress showed upregulation in expression of
   both D2R and CaMKII beta. Furthermore, rats previously exposed to MD
   showed a much greater upregulation in CaMKII beta expression, than
   animals only exposed to pubertal stress. These results support the
   two-hit hypothesis, indicating that such stressors have an additive
   effect. The main targets appear to be the D2R and the CaMKII beta, the
   latter being an important member of the DR signalling pathway, both of
   which are associated with schizophrenia. (c) 2013 ISDN. Published by

TI Galectin-3 expression in thyroid fine needle cytology (t-FNAC) uncertain
   cases: Validation of molecular markers and technology innovation
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Thyroid cancer is not very common, accounting for 12% of all cancers,
   with a population incidence of about 0.004%. Currently, the ability to
   discriminate between follicular adenoma and carcinoma represents the
   major challenge in preclinical diagnosis of thyroid proliferative
   lesions. Better discrimination between the two would help avoid
   unnecessary thyroidectomy and save valuable resources. Over the years,
   galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been proposed as a diagnostic marker with varied
   success. In this paper, we used Environmental Scanning Electron
   Microscopy Immunogold Labelling (ESEM-IGL) to investigate the expression
   of Gal-3 on Thin-Prep fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). We
   optimized the ESEM-IGL method on thyroid cell lines (RO-82 and FTC-133)
   comparing our membrane Gal-3 labeling data with Western blot. We
   evaluated 183 thyroid FNAC from Italian patients with a uncertain
   pre-surgical diagnosis. ESEM-IGL method marker sensitivity is 71.2%,
   while specificity is 53.3% and diagnostic efficacy is 61.2%. Our results
   confirmed that Gal-3 expression is associated with situations of
   hypertrophy and/or cellular hyperproliferation, pathophysiological
   situations common both to adenomas and to thyroid carcinomas. The
   innovation of thyroid FNAC Thin-Prep ESEM-IGL shows the levels of Gal-3
   immunolabeling clearly, even through the individual cells of a thyroid
   nodule. However, Gal-3 alone, as a molecular marker of thyroid cancer,
   can still have a limited application in pre-surgery diagnosis. J. Cell.

   encompasses various degrees of liver damage ranging from simple
   steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is characterized
   by hepatocellular injury/inflammation with or without fibrosis. The
   individuals with NAFLD develop NASH in 10% of the cases, and are also at
   risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epigenetic mechanisms
   of nuclear chromatin remodeling, such as DNA methylation,
   post-translational modifications of histones, and incorporation of
   histone variants into the chromatin are increasingly recognized as
   crucial factors in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. NAFLD is often
   accompanied by oxidative stress: reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
   implicated in altered reduction/oxidation (redox) reactions that attack
   cellular macromolecules and are detected in the liver of patients and
   animal models of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize recent knowledge
   advancements in the hepatic epigenetic and redox mechanisms, and their
   possible links, involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of NAFLD.

TI Behavioural and neurochemical changes induced by stress-related
   conditions are counteracted by the neurokinin-2 receptor antagonist
   saredutant
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB These experiments were undertaken to assess the mechanisms underlying
   the antidepressant-like effects of the neurokinin-2 (NK2) receptor
   antagonist saredutant (SR48968) in rats tested in the forced swim test
   (FST), by analysing hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   and plasma corticosterone [as index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis activity]. Male Wistar rats received three intraperitoneal
   injections over 24 h of vehicle, saredutant (5 mg/kg), citalopram (15
   mg/kg), clomipramine (50 mg/kg). Rats were subjected to restraint stress
   (4 h) 24 h prior to the FST procedure. This stress procedure increased
   immobility and decreased swimming behaviour in the FST; furthermore, it
   lowered hippocampal BDNF protein expression and increased plasma
   corticosterone levels. Saredutant and clomipramine or citalopram, used
   here as positive controls, reduced the immobility time in the FST both
   under basal conditions and after stress exposure. This effect was not
   attributable to changes in locomotion, because locomotor activity was
   unchanged when assessed in the open field test. Pretreatment with
   para-cholorophenylalanine (150 mg/kg, 72 h and 48 h prior to FST)
   abolished the effect of citalopram and saredutant on immobility time. At
   neurochemical level, saredutant attenuated activation of HPA axis in
   stressed animals more than clomipramine or citalopram. The behavioural
   effects of saredutant support the hypothesis that NK2 receptor activity
   is involved in stress-related disorders. These effects of saredutant may
   be related to normalization of the HPA axis. Moreover, saredutant
   increases BDNF expression in the hippocampus, confirming the role of NK2
   receptor blockade in BDNF activation following stressor application.

TI BRG1 Is Required for Formation of Senescence-Associated Heterochromatin
   Foci Induced by Oncogenic RAS or BRCA1 Loss
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB Cellular senescence is an important tumor suppression mechanism. We have
   previously reported that both oncogene-induced dissociation of BRCA1
   from chromatin and BRCA1 knockdown itself drive senescence by promoting
   formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). However,
   the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates SAHF formation and
   senescence is unclear. BRG1 is a chromatin-remodeling factor that
   interacts with BRCA1 and pRB. Here we show that BRG1 is required for
   SAHF formation and senescence induced by oncogenic RAS or BRCA1 loss.
   The interaction between BRG1 and BRCA1 is disrupted during senescence.
   This correlates with an increased level of chromatin-associated BRG1 in
   senescent cells. BRG1 knockdown suppresses the formation of SAHF and
   senescence, while it has no effect on BRCA1 chromatin dissociation
   induced by oncogenic RAS, indicating that BRG1 functions downstream of
   BRCA1 chromatin dissociation. Furthermore, BRG1 knockdown inhibits SAHF
   formation and senescence induced by BRCA1 knockdown. Conversely, BRG1
   overexpression drives SAHF formation and senescence in a DNA
   damage-independent manner. This effect depends upon BRG1's
   chromatin-remodeling activity as well as the interaction between BRG1
   and pRB. Indeed, the interaction between BRG1 and pRB is enhanced during
   senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that BRG1's
   association with the human CDKN2A and CDKN1A gene promoters was enhanced
   during senescence induced by oncogenic RAS or BRCA1 knockdown.
   Consistently, knockdown of pRB, p21(CIP1), and p16(INK4a), but not p53,
   suppressed SAHF formation induced by BRG1. Together, these studies
   reveal the molecular underpinning by which BRG1 acts downstream of BRCA1
   to promote SAHF formation and senescence.

TI Phenol oxidase is a necessary enzyme for the silkworm molting which is
   regulated by molting hormone
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Insect molting is an important developmental process of metamorphosis,
   which is initiated by molting hormone. The molting process includes the
   activation of dermal cells, epidermal cells separation, molting fluid
   secretion, the formation of new epidermis and old epidermis excoriation
   etc. Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs), dopa decarboxylase and
   acetyltransferase are necessary enzymes for this process. Traditionally,
   the phenol oxidase was considered as an enzyme for epidermal layer's
   tanning and melanization. This work suggested that polyphenol oxidases
   are one set of the key enzymes in molting, which closely related with
   the role of ecdysone in regulation of molting processes. The data showed
   that the expression peak of phenol oxidase in silkworm is higher during
   molting stage, and decreases after molting. The significant increase in
   the ecdysone levels of haemolymph was observed in the artificially fed
   silkworm larvae with ecdysone hormone. Consistently, the phenol oxidase
   expression was significantly elevated compared to the control. PPO1 RNAi
   induced phenol oxidase expression obviously declined in the silkworm
   larvae, and caused the pupae incomplete pupation. Overall, the results
   described that the phenol oxidase expression is regulated by the molting
   hormone, and is a necessary enzyme for the silkworm molting.

TI A conformational switch in HP1 releases auto-inhibition to drive
   heterochromatin assembly
SO NATURE
AB A hallmark of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin,
   conserved from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, is
   its ability to spread to adjacent genomic regions(1-6). Central to
   heterochromatin spread is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which
   recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin, oligomerizes and forms a versatile
   platform that participates in diverse nuclear functions, ranging from
   gene silencing to chromosome segregation(1-6). How HP1 proteins assemble
   on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome complex
   achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show
   that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated
   nucleosomes drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a
   spreading-competent state. In the auto-inhibited state, a histonemimic
   sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks methyl-mark recognition by the
   chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition is relieved by
   recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and
   nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the
   Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the
   spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends
   appear exposed. Disruption of the switch between the auto-inhibited and
   spreading-competent states disrupts heterochromatin assembly and gene
   silencing in vivo. These findings are reminiscent of other conditionally
   activated polymerization processes, such as actin nucleation, and open
   up a new class of regulatory mechanisms that operate on chromatin in
   vivo.

TI Molecular patterns in the evolution of serrated lesion of the colorectum
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) mostly develops from a variety of polyps
   following mainly three different molecular pathways: chromosomal
   instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and CpG island
   methylation (CIMP). Polyps are classified histologically as conventional
   adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/P)
   and traditional serrated adenomas (TSA). However, the association of
   these polyps with the different types of CRCs and the underlying genetic
   and epigenetic aberrations has yet to be resolved. In order to address
   this question we analyzed 140 tumors and 20 matched mucosae by array
   comparative genomic hybridization, by sequence analysis of the oncogenes
   BRAF, KRAS, PI3K3CA and by methylation arrays. MSI was tested indirectly
   by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a loss of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 was
   assigned as high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), while low
   microsatellite instability (MSI-L) was defined as MGMT IHC negativity
   only. CIN was detected in 78% of all MSI-H CRCs, most commonly as a gain
   of chromosome 8. Methylation data analyses allowed classification of
   samples into four groups and detected similar methylation profiles in
   SSA/P and MSI-H CRC. TSA also revealed aberrant methylation pattern, but
   clustered more heterogeneously and closer to microsatellite stable (MSS)
   CRCs. SSA/P, TSA and MSI-H CRCs had the highest degree of promotor
   methylation (CIMP pathway). Chromosomal instability, in contrast to the
   established doctrine, is a common phenomenon in MSI CRCs, yet to a lower
   extent and at later stages than in MSS CRCs. Methylation analyses
   suggest that SSA/P are precursors for MSI-H CRCs and follow the CIMP
   pathway.

TI Relationships between age and epi-genotype of the FMR1 exon 1/intron 1
   boundary are consistent with non-random X-chromosome inactivation in FM
   individuals, with the selection for the unmethylated state being most
   significant between birth and puberty
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB Methylation of the fragile X-related epigenetic element 2 (FREE2)
   located on the exon 1/intron 1 boundary of the FMR1 gene is related to
   FMRP expression and cognitive impairment in full mutation (FM; CGG200)
   individuals. We examined the relationship between age, the size of the
   FMR1 CGG expansion and the methylation output ratio (MOR) at 12 CpG
   sites proximal to the exon 1/intron 1 boundary using FREE2 MALDI-TOF MS.
   The patient cohort included 119 males and 368 females, i.e. 121 healthy
   controls (CGG40), 176 premutation (CGG 55170) and 190 FM (CGG 2132000).
   For all CpG units examined, FM males showed a significantly elevated MOR
   compared with that in hypermethylated FM females. In FM males the MOR
   for most CpG units significantly positively correlated with both age and
   CGG size (P 0.05). In FM females the skewing towards the unmethylated
   state was significant for half of the units between birth and puberty (P
   0.05). The methylation status of intron 1 CpG1012 that was most
   significantly related to cognitive impairment in our earlier study, did
   not change significantly with age in FM females. These results challenge
   the concept of fragile X syndrome (FXS)-related methylation being static
   over time, and suggest that due to the preference for the unmethylated
   state in FM females, X-inactivation at this locus is not random. The
   findings also highlight that the prognostic value of FXS methylation
   testing is not uniform between all CpG sites, and thus may need to be
   evaluated on a site-by-site basis.

TI Methyltransferase PRMT1 Is a Binding Partner of HBx and a Negative
   Regulator of Hepatitis B Virus Transcription
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is essential for virus replication
   and has been implicated in the development of liver cancer. HBx is
   recruited to viral and cellular promoters and activates transcription by
   interacting with transcription factors and coactivators. Here, we
   purified HBx-associated factors in nuclear extracts from HepG2 hepatoma
   cells and identified protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a
   novel HBx-interacting protein. We showed that PRMT1 overexpression
   reduced the transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and this
   inhibition was dependent on the methyltransferase function of PRMT1.
   Conversely, depletion of PRMT1 correlated with increased HBV
   transcription. Using a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay,
   we found that PRMT1 is recruited to HBV DNA, suggesting a direct effect
   of PRMT1 on the regulation of HBV transcription. Finally, we showed that
   HBx expression inhibited PRMT1-mediated protein methylation.
   Downregulation of PRMT1 activity was further observed in HBV-replicating
   cells in an in vivo animal model. Altogether, our results support the
   notion that the binding of HBx to PRMT1 might benefit viral replication
   by relieving the inhibitory activity of PRMT1 on HBV transcription.

TI Genome-wide methylation profiling and the PI3K-AKT pathway analysis
   associated with smoking in urothelial cell carcinoma
SO CELL CYCLE
AB Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) is the second most common genitourinary
   malignant disease in the USA, and tobacco smoking is the major known
   risk factor for UCC development. Exposure to carcinogens, such as those
   contained in tobacco smoke, is known to directly or indirectly damage
   DNA, causing mutations, chromosomal deletion events and epigenetic
   alterations in UCC. Molecular studies have shown that chromosome 9
   alterations and P53, RAS, RB and PTEN mutations are among the most
   frequent events in UCC. Recent studies suggested that continuous tobacco
   carcinogen exposure drives and enhances the selection of epigenetically
   altered cells in UCC, predominantly in the invasive form of the disease.
   However, the sequence of molecular events that leads to UCC after
   exposure to tobacco smoke is not well understood.
   To elucidate molecular events that lead to UCC oncogenesis and
   progression after tobacco exposure, we developed an in vitro cellular
   model for smoking-induced UCC. SV-40 immortalized normal HUC1 human
   bladder epithelial cells were continuously exposed to 0.1% cigarette
   smoke extract (CSE) until transformation occurred. Morphological
   alterations and increased cell proliferation of non-malignant urothelial
   cells were observed after 4 months (mo) of treatment with CSE.
   Anchorage-independent growth assessed by soft agar assay and increase in
   the migratory and invasive potential was observed in urothelial cells
   after 6 mo of CSE treatment. By performing a PCR mRNA expression array
   specific to the PI3K-AKT pathway, we found that 26 genes were
   upregulated and 22 genes were downregulated after 6 mo of CSE exposure
   of HUC1 cells. Among the altered genes, PTEN, FOXO1, MAPK1 and PDK1 were
   downregulated in the transformed cells, while AKT1, AKT2, HRAS, RAC1
   were upregulated. Validation by RT-PCR and western blot analysis was
   then performed. Furthermore, genome-wide methylation analysis revealed
   MCAM, DCC and HIC1 are hypermethylated in CSE-treated urothelial cells
   when compared with non-CSE exposed cells. The methylation status of
   these genes was validated using quantitative methylation-specific PCR
   (QMSP), confirming an increase in methylation of CSE-treated urothelial
   cells compared to untreated controls. Therefore, our findings suggest
   that a tobacco signature could emerge from distinctive patterns of
   genetic and epigenetic alterations and can be identified using an in
   vitro cellular model for the development of smoking-induced cancer.

TI Cloacal gland, endocrine testicular, and adrenocortical
   photoresponsiveness in male Japanese quail exposed to short days
SO DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Photoperiod is the most important "noise-free" seasonal environmental
   cue for synchronizing physiological states (such as reproductive
   activity) in birds. However, in photoperiodic birds such as Japanese
   quail, the effect of photoperiod on adrenocortical activity remains
   unclear, particularly in males with differences in cloacal gland
   photoresponsiveness. At 8 wk of age, birds (n = 55) were either assigned
   to a short photoperiod (8L:16D; SD) or maintained under long photoperiod
   (16L:8D; LD; control). After 5 wk of SD exposure, males were classified
   as nonresponsive (SD-NR; with foam production) or responsive (SD-R; with
   no foam production) to short days, depending on the cloacal gland volume
   was above or below 1,000 mm(3). At 14 wk of age, droppings were
   collected during 3 consecutive days to determine corticosterone (CMs)
   and androgen metabolites (AMs) by enzyme immunoassays. Male Japanese
   quail under LD showed significantly higher concentrations of CMs (300
   +/- 10 ng/g) and AMs (1,257 +/- 115 ng/g) than birds kept under SD.
   Under short days, SD-NR and SD-R showed differences (P < 0.0001), both
   in CM (153 +/- 8 ng/g and 98 +/- 6 ng/g, respectively) and AM
   concentrations (1,294 +/- 309 ng/g and 275 +/- 53 ng/g, respectively).
   Interestingly, although SD-NR males exhibited no cloacal gland arrest
   (according to cloacal gland volume and foam production) and similar
   testicular activity (AM values) to LD males, they showed lower
   concentrations of CMs compared with males that remained on LD (P <
   0.05). Our findings suggest length of photoperiod affected
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity; however, that was not the only
   factor involved, because birds subjected to shorter days but whose
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis failed to respond had intermediate
   CM values. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying
   mechanisms of this interesting finding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Dermatan sulfate synergizes with heparin in murine sperm chromatin
   decondensation
SO SYSTEMS BIOLOGY IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE
AB The mammalian sperm nucleus contains an unusually condensed chromatin,
   due to replacement of the majority of histones by protamines. However,
   soon after the spermatozoon penetrates the ooplasm at fertilization,
   decondensation of this densely packed chromatin must occur to allow
   formation of the male pronucleus and syngamy. Decondensation is
   accomplished by protamine disulfide bond reduction by oocyte glutathione
   and replacement of protamines by oocyte histones with the aid of an
   acceptor molecule. Previous results from our laboratory have
   demonstrated that heparan sulfate (HS) present in the ooplasm functions
   as protamine acceptor during human sperm decondensation in vivo. In the
   present paper, we analyze the role of heparin, structural analogue of
   HS, and dermatan sulfate (DS) in murine sperm chromatin decondensation
   in vitro, including the possibility of a synergistic effect between both
   glycosaminoglycans. Decondensation was assessed under phase contrast
   microscopy following incubation of murine spermatozoa with glutathione
   and either heparin, DS, or a combination of both. Ultrastructural
   changes taking place during decondensation were analyzed by transmission
   electron microscopy. Both glycosaminoglycans were able to promote the
   decondensation of murine spermatozoa in vitro but the decondensing
   ability of heparin was significantly higher. Use of both
   glycosaminoglycans together revealed the existence of a synergistic
   effect. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of decondensing
   spermatozoa supported these findings. Synergism between heparin and DS
   was observed both in capacitated and non-capacitated spermatozoa but
   decondensation kinetics was faster in the former. The results obtained
   indicate a new potential role for dermatan sulfate in murine sperm
   decondensation at fertilization and provide evidence of differences in
   the degree of chromatin condensation throughout the murine sperm
   nucleus.

   cancers. The goal of this study was to identify genetic and epigenetic
   factors in the promoter region that influence the expression level of
   OCT3. Haplotypes that contained the common variants, g. -81G>delGA
   (rs60515630) (minor allele frequency 11.5% in African American) and g.
   -2G>A (rs555754) (minor allele frequency>30% in all ethnic groups)
   showed significant increases in luciferase reporter activities and
   exhibited stronger transcription factor-binding affinity than the
   haplotypes that contained the major alleles. Consistent with the
   reporter assays, OCT3 messenger RNA expression levels were significantly
   higher in Asian (P < 0.001) and Caucasian (P < 0.05) liver samples from
   individuals who were homozygous for g. -2A/A in comparison with those
   homozygous for the g. -2G/G allele. Studies revealed that the
   methylation level in the basal promoter region of OCT3 was associated
   with OCT3 expression level and tumorigenesis capability in various
   prostate cancer cell lines. The methylation level of the OCT3 promoter
   was higher in 62% of prostate tumor samples compared with matched normal
   samples. Our studies demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms in the
   proximal promoter region of OCT3 alter the transcription rate of the
   gene and may be associated with altered expression levels of OCT3 in
   human liver. Aberrant methylation contributes to the reduced expression
   of OCT3 in prostate cancer. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2013) 13,

TI Insights into chromatin fibre structure by in vitro and in silico
   single-molecule stretching experiments
SO BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS
AB The detailed structure and dynamics of the chromatin fibre and their
   relation to gene regulation represent important open biological
   questions. Recent advances in single-molecule force spectroscopy
   experiments have addressed these questions by directly measuring the
   forces that stabilize and alter the folded states of chromatin, and by
   investigating the mechanisms of fibre unfolding. We present examples
   that demonstrate how complementary modelling approaches have helped not
   only to interpret the experimental findings, but also to advance our
   knowledge of force-induced events such as unfolding of chromatin with
   dynamically bound linker histones and nucleosome unwrapping.

TI Neurochemical Control of Rapid Stress-Induced Changes in Brain Aromatase
   Activity
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB In the male brain, the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) is known to be a
   critical relay for the activation of sexual behaviour, with the
   aromatisation of testosterone into 17-oestradiol (E2) playing a key
   role. Acute stress has been shown to differentially modulate the
   aromatase enzyme in this and other brain nuclei in a sex-specific
   manner. In POM specifically, stress induces increases in aromatase
   activity (AA) that are both rapid and reversible. How the physiological
   processes initiated during an acute stress response mediate sex- and
   nuclei- specific changes in AA and which stress response hormones are
   involved remains to be determined. By examining the relative effects of
   corticosterone (CORT), arginine vasotocin (AVT, the avian homologue to
   arginine vasopressin) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), the
   present study aimed to define the hormone profile regulating
   stress-induced increases in AA in the POM. We found that CORT, AVT and
   CRF all appear to play some role in these changes in the male brain. In
   addition, these effects occur in a targeted manner, such that modulation
   of the enzyme by these hormones only occurs in the POM rather than in
   all aromatase-expressing nuclei. Similarly, in the female brain, the
   experimental effects were restricted to the POM but only CRF was capable
   of inducing the stress-like increases in AA. These data further
   demonstrate the high degree of specificity (nuclei-, sex- and
   hormone-specific effects) in this system, highlighting the complexity of
   the stressaromatase link and suggesting modes through which the
   nongenomic modulation of this enzyme can result in targeted, rapid
   changes in local oestrogen concentrations.

TI Sperm chromatin in beef bulls in tropical environments
SO THERIOGENOLOGY
AB Sperm chromatin status was assessed in 565 Zebu and Zebu crossbred beef
   bulls in extensive tropical environments using the sperm chromatin
   structure assay (SCSA). The SCSA involved exposure of sperm to acid
   hydrolysis for 0.5 or 5.0 minutes, followed by flow cytometry to
   ascertain relative amounts of double-stranded (normal) and
   single-stranded (denatured) DNA, which was used to generate a DNA
   fragmentation index (%DFI). With conventional SCSA (0.5-minute SCSA),
   513 bulls (91%) had <15 %DFI, 24 bulls (4%) had 15 to 27 %DFI, and 28
   bulls (5%) had >27 %DFI. In 5.0-minute SCSA, 432 bulls (76%) had <15
   %DFI, 68 bulls (12%) had 15 to 27 %DFI and 65 bulls (12%) had >27 %DFI.
   For most bulls, the SCSA was repeatable on two to four occasions;
   however, because most bulls had <15 %DFI, repeatability of the SCSA will
   need to be determined in a larger number of bulls in the 15 to 27 %DFI
   and >27 %DFI categories. The %DFI was negatively correlated with several
   bull semen parameters and the strongest negative correlation was with
   normal sperm. There was a strong positive correlation between %DFI and
   sperm head abnormalities. Based on these findings, most Zebu beef bulls
   in extensive tropical environments had relatively stable sperm
   chromatin. Based on the apparent negative correlations with conventional
   semen parameters, we inferred that the SCSA measured a unique feature of
   sperm quality, which has also been suggested for other species. Further
   studies on the relationships between sperm chromatin stability and
   fertility are required in beef bulls before chromatin status can be used
   as an additional predictor of the siring capacity of individual bulls in
   extensive multiple-sire herds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Metabolic Programming of MEST DNA Methylation by Intrauterine Exposure
   to Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
SO DIABETES
AB Epigenetic processes are primary candidates when searching for
   mechanisms that can stably modulate gene expression and metabolic
   pathways according to early life conditions. To test the effects of
   gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on the epigenome of the next
   generation, cord blood and placenta tissue were obtained from 88
   newborns of mothers with dietetically treated GDM, 98 with
   insulin-dependent GDM, and 65 without GDM. Bisulfite pyrosequencing was
   used to compare the methylation levels of seven imprinted genes involved
   in prenatal and postnatal growth, four genes involved in energy
   metabolism, one anti-inflammatory gene, one tumor suppressor gene, one
   pluripotency gene, and two repetitive DNA families. The maternally
   imprinted MEST gene, the nonirnprinted glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1
   gene, and interspersed ALU repeats showed significantly decreased
   methylation levels (4-7 percentage points for MEST, 1-2 for NR3C1, and
   one for ALUs) in both GDM groups, compared with controls, in both
   analyzed tissues. Significantly decreased blood MEST methylation (3
   percentage points) also was observed in adults with morbid obesity
   compared with normal-weight controls. Our results support the idea that
   intrauterine exposure to GDM has long-lasting effects on the epigenome
   of the offspring. Specifically, epigenetic malprogramming of MEST may
   contribute to obesity predisposition throughout life. Diabetes

TI DNA methylation by CcrM activates the transcription of two genes
   required for the division of Caulobacter crescentus
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB DNA methylation regulates many processes, including gene expression, by
   superimposing secondary information on DNA sequences. The conserved CcrM
   enzyme, which methylates adenines in GANTC sequences, is essential to
   the viability of several Alphaproteobacteria. In this study, we find
   that Caulobacter crescentus cells lacking the CcrM enzyme accumulate low
   levels of the two conserved FtsZ and MipZ proteins, leading to a severe
   defect in cell division. This defect can be compensated by the
   expression of the ftsZ gene from an inducible promoter or by spontaneous
   suppressor mutations that promote FtsZ accumulation. We show that CcrM
   promotes the transcription of the ftsZ and mipZ genes and that the ftsZ
   and mipZ promoter regions contain a conserved CGACTC motif that is
   critical to their activities and to their regulation by CcrM. In
   addition, our results suggest that the ftsZ promoter has the lowest
   activity when the CGACTC motif is non-methylated, an intermediate
   activity when it is hemi-methylated and the highest activity when it is
   fully methylated. The regulation of ftsZ expression by DNA methylation
   may explain why CcrM is essential in a subset of Alphaproteobacteria.

TI Mercury biomarkers and DNA methylation among michigan dental
   professionals
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS
AB Modification of the epigenome may be a mechanism underlying toxicity and
   disease following chemical exposure. Animal and human data suggest that
   mercury (Hg) impacts DNA methylation. We hypothesize that methylmercury
   and inorganic Hg exposures from fish consumption and dental amalgams,
   respectively, may be associated with altered DNA methylation at global
   repetitive elements (long interspersed elements, LINE-1) and candidate
   genes related to epigenetic processes (DNMT1) and protection against Hg
   toxicity (SEPW1, SEPP1). Dental professionals were recruited at Michigan
   Dental Association (MDA) meetings in 2009 and 2010. Subjects (n=131)
   provided survey data (e.g. exposure sources, demographics) and
   biological samples for Hg measurement and epigenetic analysis. Total Hg
   was quantified via atomic absorption spectrophotometry in hair and
   urine, indicative of methylmercury and inorganic Hg exposures,
   respectively. Global repetitive and candidate gene methylation was
   quantified via pyrosequencing of bisulfite converted DNA isolated from
   buccal mucosa. Hair Hg (geometric mean (95% CI): 0.37 (0.310.44) mu g/g)
   and urine Hg (0.70 (0.600.83) mu g/L) were associated with sources of
   exposure (fish consumption and dental amalgams, respectively).
   Multivariable linear regression revealed a trend of SEPP1
   hypomethylation with increasing hair Hg levels, and this was significant
   (P<0.05) among males. The trend remained when excluding non-dentists. No
   significant relationships between urine Hg and DNA methylation were
   observed. Thus, in a limited cohort, we identified an association
   between methylmercury exposure and hypomethylation of a potentially
   labile region of the genome (SEPP1 promoter), and this relationship was
   gender specific. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 54:195203, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley

TI Oxidative stress induces DNA demethylation and histone acetylation in
   SH-SY5Y cells: potential epigenetic mechanisms in gene transcription in
   A beta production
SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB Overwhelming evidence has suggested that enhanced oxidative stress is
   involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). Amyloid-beta (A beta) that composes senile plaques plays a causal
   role in AD, and its abnormal deposition in brains is the typical
   neuropathologic hallmark of AD. Recent studies have suggested that
   epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the initiation and
   development of AD. In the present study, we investigated the epigenetic
   mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, involved in
   the transcription of AD-related genes with A beta production under
   oxidative stress. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with
   hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and used as the cell model. The
   intracellular A beta level was significantly increased in
   H(2)O(2)-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of amyloid-beta precursor
   protein and beta-site amyloid-beta precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1
   was upregulated by demethylation in the gene promoters associated with
   the reduction of methyltransferases. Meanwhile, H(2)O(2) induced the
   upregulation of histone acetyltransferases p300/cAMP-response element
   binding protein (p300/CBP) and downregulation of histone deacetylases.
   DNA hypomethylation induced by DNA methyltransferase inhibitor could
   activate the DNA binding activity of transcription factor nuclear
   factor-kappa B, whereas no significant effect was observed on specific
   protein 1. DNA binding activities of nuclear factor-kappa B and specific
   protein 1 were activated by histone hyperacetylation induced by histone
   deacetylase inhibitor. These findings suggested that oxidative stress
   resulted in an imbalance between DNA methylation and demethylation and
   histone acetylation and deacetylation associated with the activation of
   transcription factors, leading to the AD-related gene transcription in
   the A beta overproduction. This could be a potential mechanism for
   oxidative stress response, which might contribute to the pathogenesis
   and development of AD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Decreased expression of WWOX in the development of esophageal squamous
   cell carcinoma
SO MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS
AB The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) gene, located on
   chromosome 16q23.324.1 in the region recognized as the common fragile
   site FRA16D is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in
   various carcinomas. The present study was to investigate the alterations
   of WWOX expression and its correlation with polymorphism, the level of
   WWOX loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and methylation status in esophageal
   squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR methods
   were used, respectively, to examine the protein and mRNA expression of
   WWOX in ESCC tissues. PCR-RFLP, PCR-SSLP, and MSP approach were used,
   respectively, to detect polymorphisms of rs3764340, rs2548861, and
   rs1079635 site, the level of LOH, and WWOX methylation status. Family
   history of upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGIC) significantly increased
   the risk of developing ESCC. Protein and mRNA expression of WWOX was
   reduced in ESCC tumor tissues and was associated with LOH and
   hypermethylation of the gene. The G allele of rs3764340 significantly
   elevated the risk of developing ESCC and was associated with TNM stage.
   LOH at the WWOX loci was observed in 41.4% tumors. The hypermethylation
   of promoter and exon1 of WWOX was found to be occurred in dysplastic
   tissues and the methylation frequency of WWOX in ESCC tumor tissues was
   significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues and was
   associated with UGIC family history. In all, these results indicate that
   the WWOX gene may play an important role in the development of ESCC
   especially in individuals with UGIC family history. (c) 2011 Wiley

TI Pharmacokinetic evaluation of cabozantinib for the treatment of thyroid
   cancer
SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG METABOLISM & TOXICOLOGY
AB Introduction: Conventional treatment modalities for thyroid cancer lead
   to complete remission in only one-third of patients with distant
   metastases. On the other hand, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and
   anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), although rare, are responsible for a
   significant percentage of thyroid cancer-related deaths. New treatments
   are needed to treat such patients
   Areas covered: The aim of this review is to provide the latest
   information on cabozantinib (CBZ), a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
   that is currently used mainly as a treatment of MTC. The authors
   collated data that were retrieved from a PubMed literature search.
   Expert opinion: CBZ targets multiple cell-signaling pathways involved in
   the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. These are namely VEGF
   receptor-2, hepatocyte growth factor receptor and rearranged during
   transfection receptor. Furthermore, it is a drug which may be used in
   cases where conventional therapies (mainly for MTC) are proved
   ineffective or have shown poor results with a good outcome. CBZ may also
   be administered alone or in combination with other drugs of the same
   family.

TI Demonstration of Innate Immune Responses in the Thyroid Gland: Potential
   to Sense Danger and a Possible Trigger for Autoimmune Reactions
SO THYROID
AB Background: Autoimmune thyroid disease is an archetypal organ-specific
   autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the production of thyroid
   autoantibodies and lymphocytic infiltration into the thyroid. However,
   the underlying mechanisms by which specific thyroid antibodies are
   produced are largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that innate
   immune responses affect both the phenotype and the severity of
   autoimmune reactions. Moreover, it appears that even non-immune cells,
   including thyroid cells, have an ability to launch such responses. The
   aim of this study was to conduct a more detailed analysis of innate
   immune responses of the thyroid upon stimulation with various "non-self"
   and "self" factors that might contribute to the initiation of autoimmune
   reactions.
   Methods: We used rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells, human thyroid cells, and mice
   to investigate the effects of various pathogen-associated molecular
   patterns (PAMPs), danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and
   iodide on gene expression and function that were related to innate
   immune responses.
   Results: RT-PCR analysis showed that both rat and human thyroid cells
   expressed mRNAs for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that sense PAMPs.
   Stimulation of thyrocytes with TLR ligands resulted in activation of the
   interferon-beta (IFN-beta) promoter and the nuclear factor
   kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF kappa B)-dependent
   promoter. As a result, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and type
   I interferons were produced. Similar activation was observed when
   thyroid cells were stimulated with double-stranded DNA, one of the
   typical DAMPs. In addition to these PAMPs and DAMPs, treatment of
   thyroid cells with high concentrations of iodide increased mRNA
   expression of various cytokines.
   Conclusion: We show that thyroid cells express functional sensors for
   exogenous and endogenous dangers, and that they are capable of launching
   innate immune responses without the assistance of immune cells. Such
   responses may relate to the development of thyroiditis, which in turn
   may trigger autoimmune reactions.

TI Effects of paternal folate deficiency on the expression of insulin-like

SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Scope We examined the effect of paternal folate deficiency on the folate
   content, the percentage of 5-methycytosine (percentage of 5-mC) in the
   total DNA, and the protein expression of insulin-like growth factor-2
   (IGF-2) in the fetal whole brain. Methods and results Rats were mated
   after males were fed a folic acid deficient (PD) or folic acid
   supplemented (PS) diet for 4 weeks, and fetuses were killed on day 20 of
   gestation. The folate content in the fetal liver was significantly lower
   in the PD group than in the PS group, whereas it did not differ in the
   fetal whole brain. The percentage of 5-mC and the protein expression of
   IGF-2 in the fetal whole brain were both lower in the PD group than in
   the PS group. There were positive correlations between paternal liver
   and testis folate content and the percentage of 5-mC and IGF-2
   expression in the fetal whole brain. Conclusion Our results on the
   folate content, the percentage of 5-mC, and IGF-2 expression in the
   fetal whole brain show that paternal folate deficiency at mating can
   influence fetal brain DNA methylation and IGF-2 expression despite an
   adequate maternal folate status during the gestational period.

TI Inhibition of H3K27 histone trimethylation activates fibroblasts and
   induces fibrosis
SO ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES
AB Objectives Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone
   acetylation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic
   sclerosis. However, histone methylation has not been investigated so
   far. We therefore aimed to evaluate the role of the trimethylation of
   histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on fibroblast activation and
   fibrosis.
   Methods H3K27me3 was inhibited by 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) in
   cultured fibroblasts and in two murine models of dermal fibrosis.
   Fibrosis was analysed by assessment of the dermal thickening,
   determination of the hydroxyproline content and by quantification of the
   numbers of myofibroblasts. The expression of fos-related antigen 2
   (fra-2) was assessed by real-time PCR, western blot and
   immunohistochemistry and modulated by siRNA.
   Results Inhibition of H3K27me3 stimulated the release of collagen in
   cultured fibroblasts in a time and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with
   DZNep exacerbated fibrosis induced by bleomycin or by overexpression of
   a constitutively active transforming growth factor beta receptor type I.
   Moreover, treatment with DZNep alone was sufficient to induce fibrosis.
   Inhibition of H3K27me3 induced the expression of the profibrotic
   transcription factor fra-2 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of fra-2
   completely prevented the profibrotic effects of DZNep.
   Conclusions These data demonstrate a novel role of H3 Lys27 histone
   methylation in fibrosis. In contrast to other epigenetic modifications
   such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, H3 Lys27 histone
   methylation acts as a negative regulator of fibroblast activation in
   vitro and in vivo by repressing the expression of fra-2.

AB Scope Inadequate folate intake increases risk for colorectal cancer. We
   previously showed that low-folate diets induced intestinal tumors in
   BALB/c mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice. We suggested that DNA damage,
   altered methylation, and reduced apoptosis could contribute to
   tumorigenesis in this model. Methods and results To identify genes
   involved in tumorigenesis, we compared gene expression profiles in
   preneoplastic intestine of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice-fed low folate. We
   identified 74 upregulated and 90 downregulated genes in BALB/c compared
   to C57BL/6 mice. We validated decreased expression of Bcmo1 and
   increased expression of Aldh1a, which would be expected to upregulate
   the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) pathway,
   and confirmed the expected upregulation of several Ppara downstream
   genes. We verified, in BALB/c mice, reduced expression of Sprr2a, a gene
   that increases resistance to oxidative damage, and of two
   oncosuppressors (Bmp5 and Arntl). Low folate increased Ppara and Aldh1a1
   expression, and decreased Bcmo1, Sprr2a, and Bmp5 expression in BALB/c,
   compared to BALB/c on control diets. Bcmo1, Ppara, and Bmp5 showed
   differential DNA methylation related to strain, diet, and/or Mthfr
   genotype. Conclusion Disturbed regulation of the retinoid/PPARA pathway,
   which influences oxidative damage, and altered expression of tumor
   suppressors may contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis induced by
   low-folate intake.

TI Distinctive microRNAs in esophageal tumor: early diagnosis, prognosis
   judgment, and tumor treatment
SO DISEASES OF THE ESOPHAGUS
AB Esophageal tumor (ET) is aggressive and has poor prognosis. Although the
   incidence of ET has been reduced by the changing tumor profile, the
   5-year survival and mortality rate of ET has not significantly changed,
   and the outlook has remained bleak. Therefore, new molecular markers for
   early diagnosis and prognosis judgment are urgently required. In recent
   years, tumor has been widely regarded as genetic disease along with
   epigenetic abnormalities. DNA methylation, histone deacetylation,
   chromatin remodeling, gene imprinting, and noncoding RNA regulation are
   the major parts of epigenetic regulation. Mounting evidence exists that
   miRNAs (microRNA), a class of small, endogenous, and non-protein-coding
   RNAs, provide a novel tool for early clinical diagnosis, prognosis
   judgment, and gene therapy of ET. In this review, we provide a general
   overview of the connection between miRNA profiles and their target
   genes. We also describe in detail in ET from the aspect of clinical
   insights, the potential application of miRNAs as biomarkers, potential
   diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

TI Deregulation of protein methylation in melanoma
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Loss of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) expression and a
   concomitant accumulation of 5'-methyl-thioadenosine (MTA) characterise
   several tumour entities including malignant melanoma. MTA affects
   cellular signalling, proliferation and migration not only of cancer but
   also surrounding cells including lymphocytes and stromal fibroblasts.
   The mode of action of MTA is still not known. Interestingly, MTA is a
   known potent inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs)
   and is used as a tool in studying activity and impact of PRMTs. This
   study aimed at analysing PRMTs in melanoma and the potential impact of
   MTA on tumourigenesis.
   Our findings demonstrate that expression of PRMT4/CARM1 and PRMT6 is
   deregulated in melanoma, whereas expression of the remaining PRMTs stays
   unchanged. General PRMT activity and, consequently, symmetric and
   asymmetric protein methylation are reduced significantly in melanoma
   cells and tissues. This is due to a loss of MTAP expression and
   accumulation of MTA. Reduction of protein methylation by MTA affects
   cell signalling and leads, for example, to an activation of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. The effects of
   endogeneous MTA on PRMTs as presented in this study can strongly support
   the migratory and invasive phenotype of melanoma cells. (C) 2012

SO EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC PATENTS
AB The patent presents 140 purine and 7-azapurine derivatives as potent
   inhibitors of DOT1L histone methyltransferase that might be useful in
   the treatment of leukemia with MLL rearrangements. It is becoming more
   and more evident that the deregulation of chromatin modifiers such as
   DOT1L plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. As yet, the number of
   pharmaceutical agents targeting chromatin modifiers is still limited.
   The market for such compounds has been estimated to be potentially as
   large as one third of all cancer patients. Overall, the prospective of a
   targeted product (i.e., a drug targeting a commonly affected chromatin
   modifier) is very promising, and exponentially growing investments into
   this market are anticipated.

TI Resetting epigenetic signatures to induce somatic cell reprogramming
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB Somatic cell reprogramming consists of the induction of a complex
   sequence of events that results in the modification of the developmental
   state of the cell. It is now routinely possible to reprogram fully
   differentiated cells back to pluripotent cells, and to
   transdifferentiate cells of a given type in cells of a totally different
   lineage origin. However, whether there are key initiating factors that
   are distinct from those that control stem-cell renewal and that can
   initiate the reprogramming process remains unknown. In contrast, what is
   clear is that, by modifying the epigenetic status of a cell, its
   reprogramming can be initiated. Here, we review the current literature
   that shows how the plasticity of a cell can be modulated by modifying
   its epigenetic status, and we discuss how epigenetic barriers can be
   removed, to induce an efficient reprogramming process.

TI MBTD1 is associated with Pr-Set7 to stabilize H4K20me1 in mouse oocyte
   meiotic maturation
SO CELL CYCLE
AB H4K20me1 is a critical histone lysine methyl modification in eukaryotes.
   It is recognized and "read" by various histone lysine methyl
   modification binding proteins. In this study, the function of MBTD1, a
   member of the Polycomb protein family containing four MBT domains, was
   comprehensively studied in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. The results
   showed that depletion of MBTD1 caused reduced expression of histone
   lysine methyl transferase Pr-Set7 and H4K20me1 as well as increased
   oocyte arrest at the GV stage. Increased gamma H2AX foci were formed,
   and DNA damage repair checkpoint protein 53BP1 was downregulated.
   Furthermore, depletion of MBTD1 activated the cell cycle checkpoint
   protein Chk1 and downregulated the expression of cyclin B1 and cdc2.
   MBTD1 knockdown also affected chromosome configuration in GV stage
   oocytes and chromosome alignment at the MII stage. All these phenotypes
   were reproduced when the H4K20 methyl transferase Pr-Set7 was depleted.
   Co-IP demonstrated that MBTD1 was correlated with Pr-Set7 in mouse
   oocytes. Our results demonstrate that MBTD1 is associated with Pr-Set7
   to stabilize H4K20me1 in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.

TI Thyroid Follicle Formation and Thyroglobulin Expression in Multipotent
   Endodermal Stem Cells
SO THYROID
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of
   transcriptional induction on thyroid follicular cell (TFC)
   differentiation from endodermally matured embryonic stem (ES) cells. The
   thyroid transcription factors-NKx2 homeobox 1 (NKx2-1, formerly called
   TTF-1) and Paired box gene 8 (Pax8)-are known to associate biochemically
   and synergistically in the activation of thyroid functional genes
   including the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), thyrotropin (TSH) receptor
   (TSHR), thyroglobulin (Tg), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) genes. In this
   study, we investigated the ability of ectopically expressed Pax8 and
   NKx2-1 to further the induction and differentiation of murine ES cells
   into potential TFCs.
   Methods: ES cells were stably transfected with either the Pax8 gene, the
   NKx2-1 gene, or both genes to study the induction of NIS, TSHR, Tg, and
   TPO genes as assessed using both quantitative reverse-transcription
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and protein expression. The derived
   cells were cultured with or without the presence of activin A to allow
   their differentiation into multipotent endodermal cells.
   Results: The four thyroid-specific genes NIS, TSHR, Tg, and TPO were all
   significantly activated by expressing both transcription factors within
   the same ES cell. In contrast, significant but much lower
   transcriptional activity of the TSHR, Tg, and TPO genes was detected in
   cells expressing just NKx2-1, and only the NIS and TSHR genes responded
   to Pax8 alone. No Tg protein expression could be detected prior to their
   development into endodermal derivatives. However, after further
   differentiation of postembryoid body ES cells with activin A and TSH
   into endodermal cell lines, those cells with dual transfection of Pax8
   and NKx2-1 demonstrated greatly enhanced expression of the NIS, TSHR,
   Tg, and TPO genes to such a degree that it was similar to that found in
   control thyroid cells. Furthermore, these same cells formed
   three-dimensional neofollicles in vitro and expressed Tg protein, but
   these phenomena were absent from lines expressing only Pax8 or NKx2-1.
   Conclusion: These findings provide further evidence that co-expression
   of Pax8 and NKx2-1 in murine ES cells may induce the differentiation of
   thyroid-specific gene expression within endodermally differentiated ES
   cells and commit them to form three-dimensional neofollicular
   structures.

   A, Fischer JD, Kaiyala KJ, Schwartz MW, Morton GJ. In uncontrolled
   diabetes, thyroid hormone and sympathetic activators induce
   thermogenesis without increasing glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue.
   Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 304: E734-E746, 2013. First published
   February 5, 2013; doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00488.2012.-Recent advances in
   human brown adipose tissue (BAT) imaging technology have renewed
   interest in the identification of BAT activators for the treatment of
   obesity and diabetes. In uncontrolled diabetes (uDM), activation of BAT
   is implicated in glucose lowering mediated by intracerebroventricular
   (icv) administration of leptin, which normalizes blood glucose levels in
   streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The potent effect of icv
   leptin to increase BAT glucose uptake in STZ-diabetes is accompanied by
   the return of reduced plasma thyroxine (T-4) levels and BAT uncoupling
   protein-1 (Ucp1) mRNA levels to nondiabetic controls. We therefore
   sought to determine whether activation of thyroid hormone receptors is
   sufficient in and of itself to lower blood glucose levels in
   STZ-diabetes and whether this effect involves activation of BAT. We
   found that, although systemic administration of the thyroid hormone
   (TR)beta-selective agonist GC-1 increases energy expenditure and induces
   further weight loss in STZ-diabetic rats, it neither increased BAT
   glucose uptake nor attenuated diabetic hyperglycemia. Even when GC-1 was
   administered in combination with a beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist
   to mimic sympathetic nervous system activation, glucose uptake was not
   increased in STZ-diabetic rats, nor was blood glucose lowered, yet this
   intervention potently activated BAT. Similar results were observed in
   animals treated with active thyroid hormone (T-3) instead of GC-1. Taken
   together, our data suggest that neither returning normal plasma thyroid
   hormone levels nor BAT activation has any impact on diabetic
   hyperglycemia, and that in BAT, increases of Ucp1 gene expression and
   glucose uptake are readily dissociated from one another in this setting.

TI Low dietary folate and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency
   may lead to pregnancy complications through modulation of ApoAI and IFN-
   in spleen and placenta, and through reduction of methylation potential
SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Scope Genetic or nutritional disturbances in folate metabolism lead to
   hyperhomocysteinemia and adverse reproductive outcomes. Folate-dependent
   homocysteine remethylation is required for methylation reactions and may
   influence choline/betaine metabolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been
   suggested to play a role in inflammation. The goal of this study was to
   determine whether folate-related pregnancy complications could be due to
   altered expression of some inflammatory mediators or due to disturbances
   in methylation intermediates. Methods and results Pregnant mice with or
   without a deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were
   fed control diets or folate-deficient (FD) diets; tissues were collected
   at embryonic day 14.5. FD decreased plasma phosphocholine and increased
   plasma glycerophosphocholine and lysophosphatidylcholine. Liver betaine,
   phosphocholine, and S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios
   were reduced in FD. In liver, spleen, and placenta, the lowest levels of
   apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI) were observed in Mthfr+/ mice fed FD.
   Increased interferon-gamma (IFN-) was observed in spleen and placentae
   due to FD or Mthfr genotype. Plasma homocysteine correlated negatively
   with liver and spleen ApoAI, and positively with IFN-. Conclusion Low
   dietary folate or Mthfr deficiency during pregnancy may result in
   adverse pregnancy outcomes by altering expression of the inflammatory
   mediators ApoAI and IFN- in spleen and placenta. Disturbances in choline
   metabolism or methylation reactions may also play a role.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Gene expression of the alpha-1 subunit of the L-type voltage-gated
   calcium channel, CACNA1C, is known to be complexly regulated. Because
   CACNA1C is not only a crucial gene in normal brain function but also a
   promising candidate risk gene for psychiatric disorders such as bipolar
   disorder and schizophrenia, elucidating the molecular basis of
   transcriptional regulatory mechanism will be critically important. Here
   we examined DNA methylation status of CpG islands and a CpG island shore
   on mouse Cacna1c in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei, which were
   separated with a fluorescent activated cell sorting technique. We found
   that neurons and non-neurons showed differential DNA methylation profile
   on a CpG island shore. This difference was evolutionarily conserved in
   human neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei in the prefrontal cortex,
   suggesting that DNA methylation status on the CpG island shore of
   Cacna1c may have an important role in transcript regulation. (C) 2012

TI Prevention of Helicobacter pylori-Induced Gastric Cancers in Gerbils by
   a DNA Demethylating Agent
SO CANCER PREVENTION RESEARCH
AB Suppression of aberrant DNA methylation is a novel approach to cancer
   prevention, but, so far, the efficacy of the strategy has not been
   evaluated in cancers associated with chronic inflammation. Gastric
   cancers induced by Helicobacter pylori infection are known to involve
   aberrant DNA methylation and associated with severe chronic inflammation
   in their early stages. Here, we aimed to clarify whether suppression of
   aberrant DNA methylation can prevent H. pylori-induced gastric cancers
   using a Mongolian gerbil model. Administration of a DNA demethylating
   agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), to gerbils (0.125 mg/kg for
   50-55 weeks) decreased the incidence of gastric cancers induced by H.
   pylori infection and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment from 55.2%
   to 23.3% (P < 0.05). In gastric epithelial cells, DNA methylation levels
   of six CpG islands (HE6, HG2, SB1, SB5, SF12, and SH6) decreased to 46%
   to 68% (P < 0.05) of gerbils without 5-aza-dC treatment. Also, the
   global DNA methylation level decreased from 83.0% +/- 4.5% to 80.3% +/-
   4.4% (mean +/- SD) by 5-aza-dC treatment (P < 0.05). By 5-aza-dC
   treatment, Il1b and Nos2 were downregulated (42% and 58% of gerbils
   without, respectively) but Tnf was upregulated (187%), suggesting that
   5-aza-dC treatment induced dysregulation of inflammatory responses. No
   obvious adverse effect of 5-aza-dC treatment was observed, besides
   testicular atrophy. These results showed that 5-aza-dC treatment can
   prevent H. pylori-induced gastric cancers and suggested that removal of
   induced DNA methylation and/or suppression of DNA methylation induction
   can become a target for prevention of chronic inflammation-associated
   cancers. Cancer Prev Res; 6(4); 263-70. (c) 2013 AACR.

TI Larval life history and anti-predator strategies are affected by
   breeding phenology in an amphibian
SO OECOLOGIA
AB Seasonal time constraints can pose strong selection on life histories.
   Time-constrained animals should prioritise fast development over
   predation risk to avoid unfavourable growing conditions. However,
   changes in phenology could alter the balance between anti-predator and
   developmental needs. We studied variation of anti-predator strategies in
   common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles in four populations from the two
   extremes of a latitudinal gradient across Sweden. We examined, under
   common conditions in the laboratory, the anti-predator responses and
   life histories of tadpoles raised with predatory Aeshna dragonfly larvae
   in two consecutive years with a difference of 20 days in breeding time
   in the north, but no difference in breeding time in the nouth. In a year
   with late breeding, northern tadpoles did not modify their behaviour and
   morphology in the presence of predators, and metamorphosed faster and
   smaller than tadpoles born in a year with early breeding. In the year
   with early breeding, northern tadpoles showed a completely different
   anti-predator strategy by reducing activity and developing morphological
   defences in the presence of predators. We discuss the possible
   mechanisms that could activate these responses (likely a form of
   environmentally-mediated parental effect). To our knowledge, this is the
   first study to show that a vertebrate modifies the anti-predator
   strategy of its offspring in response to natural variation in
   reproductive phenology, which highlights the need to consider phenology
   in studies of life-history evolution.

TI Dietary folic acid intake differentially affects methionine metabolism
   markers and hippoccampus morphology in aged rats
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB Folic acid (FA) is an emerging nutritional factor in the pathogenesis of
   diverse neurodegenerative disorders by still unknown mechanisms. The
   hippocampus is altered during the loss of cognitive abilities in humans
   and selectively affected when homocysteine increases. The aim was to
   evaluate the potential protective role of folic acid in the maintenance
   of biochemical markers related to the methionine cycle, as well as the
   integrity of the hippocampus as part of the brain in aged rats.
   Male Sprague-Dawley rats (18 months old) were assigned to four different
   folic acid groups (0 mg FA/kg diet, deficient; 2 mg FA/kg diet, control;
   8 mg FA/kg diet, moderate supplementation; 40 mg FA/kg diet, extra
   supplementation) for 30 days. We evaluated several parameters related to
   the methionine cycle. In addition, hippocampus areas were immunostained
   for specific neuronal markers and astrocytes.
   Serum folate levels increased according to FA dietary level (p < 0.01).
   There was a significant increase in the serum homocysteine
   concentrations in the folic acid-deficient diet group (p < 0.01).
   However, brain S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine did not
   differ significantly between the folic acid groups. Consequently, the
   methylation ratio was also unchanged. The morphometric analysis did not
   show any differences in the number of neurons and astrocytes between
   groups, except when comparing the folic acid-deficient diet versus folic
   acid-supplemented diet in the striatum of the hippocampus.
   Clearly, the dietary FA deficiency negatively affects the methionine
   metabolism biomarkers, while excessive supplementation seems to be
   unnecessary for optimal maintenance of the methylation cycle and
   hippocampus integrity.

TI The influence of puberty on stress reactivity and forebrain
   glucocorticoid receptor levels in inbred and outbred strains of male and
   female mice
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Objective: To examine stress-induced corticosterone responses and
   forebrain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels in prepubertal and adult,
   male and female mice of three commonly used inbred (C57BL/6, BALB/c) and
   outbred (Swiss Webster) strains.
   Methods: Prepubertal (30 days of age) and adult (75 days of age), male
   and female C57BL/6, BALB/c, and Swiss Webster mice were exposed to a 30
   min session of restraint stress. Plasma corticosterone was measured
   before (basal), or 0, 30, or 60 min after termination of the stressor.
   GR protein levels of the medial prefrontal cortex, paraventricular
   nucleus of the hypothalamus, and hippocampus were also measured via
   tissue punches and western blots in the prepubertal and adult males and
   females at the basal time point.
   Results: In response to acute stress, prepubertal males of both inbred
   strains showed greater hormonal responsiveness than their adult
   counterparts, while females of these strains displayed similar
   stress-induced corticosterone responses, independent of age. Conversely,
   only the females of the outbred Swiss Webster strain showed
   pubertal-related changes, with adult females showing greater hormonal
   reactivity compared to prepubertal females. Despite these significant
   differences in hormonal reactivity, we found little difference in GR
   protein levels in the brain regions examined.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that pubertal-dependent differences in
   stress reactivity can be significantly influenced by sex and genetic
   background. Moreover, these data provide points of departure for future
   studies investigating how puberty, sex, and genetic background interact
   to shape both short- and long-term effects of stress on mental and
   physical health. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Neural lineage-specific homeoprotein BRN2 is directly involved in TTF1
   expression in small-cell lung cancer
SO LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
AB Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) plays crucial roles in thyroid,
   lung, and developing brain morphogenesis. Because TTF1-expressing
   neoplasms are generated from organs and tissues that normally express
   TTF1, such as the thyroid follicular epithelium and peripheral lung
   airway epithelium, TTF1 is widely used as a cell lineage-specific and
   diagnostic marker for thyroid carcinomas and for lung adenocarcinomas
   with terminal respiratory unit (TRU) differentiation. However, among
   lung neuroendocrine tumors, small-cell carcinomas (small-cell lung
   cancers (SCLCs)), most of which are generated from the central airway,
   also frequently express TTF1 at high levels. To clarify how SCLCs
   express TTF1, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of its expression
   using cultivated lung cancer cells and focusing upon neural
   cell-specific transcription factors. Both SCLC cells and lung
   adenocarcinoma cells predominantly expressed isoform 2 of TTF1, and TTF1
   promoter assays in SCLC cells revealed that the crucial region for
   activation of the promoter, which is adjacent to the transcription start
   site of TTF1 isoform 2, has potent FOX-, LHX-, and BRN2-binding sites.
   Transfection experiments using expression vectors for FOXA1, FOXA2,
   LHX2, LHX6, and BRN2 showed that BRN2 substantially upregulated TTF1
   expression, whereas FOXA1/2 weakly upregulated TTF1 expression. BRN2 and
   FOXA1/2 binding to the TTF1 promoter was confirmed through chromatin
   immunoprecipitation experiments, and TTF1 expression in SCLC cells was
   considerably downregulated after BRN2 knockdown. Furthermore, the TTF1
   promoter in SCLC cells was scarcely methylated, and immunohistochemical
   examinations using a series of primary lung tumors indicated that TTF1
   and BRN2 were coexpressed only in SCLC cells. These findings suggest
   that TTF1 expression in SCLC is a cell lineage-specific phenomenon that
   involves the developing neural cell-specific homeoprotein BRN2.

TI Relationships Between Fertility and Some Parameters in Male Broiler
   Breeders (Body and Testicular Weight, Histology and Immunohistochemistry
   of Testes, Spermatogenesis and Hormonal Levels)
SO REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB In a farm of grandparent broiler breeder chickens, we followed the
   development of 350 roosters from 6 to 55weeks of age. Data collected and
   evaluated from these males included body weight, testicular weight,
   histologic and immunohistochemistry studies of the testes, hormone
   levels (testosterone, estradiol and corticosterone) and sperm
   production. The objective was to understand the factors that affect or
   influence hatch loss that is commonly observed after 45weeks of age in
   breeder flocksare often correlated to broiler breeder male chickens. The
   results of this study showed that in conjunction with the weight of the
   rooster, the testicle weight increases quickly after the rooster
   receives light stimulation. At an older age, the study showed that there
   is a process of testicular shrinkage, and the same effect is seen in
   sperm production and testosterone levels in broiler breeder roosters.
   From the histology evaluation, we defined 5 histologic phases that
   illustrate the evolution of the testicular tissue: perinatal, infantile,
   puberty, adult and senile. We observed that the adult males with a body
   weight <3800g were infertile or had subfertile levels and also had low
   levels of testosterone and high levels of corticosterone. In contrast,
   the heaviest males showed correct testicular vitality, high levels of
   testosterone and low levels of corticosterone. However, the roosters
   that had acquired this high body weight were also at risk of having less
   complete copulations because of their physical mass. The loss of
   uniformity of the males and the appearance of hierarchies within the
   flock accompany a decline in the percentages of hatches as a consequence
   of the poor confirmation of the males for copulation or the restriction
   to the access to the females. Results of this study show that the
   decrease in fertility from 45weeks of age has been associated with a
   decline in testicular weight, sperm production and the testosterone
   levels in animals with a sub-par weight. Likewise, decreasing hatch in
   older flocks may also result from a loss of conformation, and the lack
   of complete copulations is possible because of animals that are grossly
   overweight.

TI Early-life stress affects the behavioural and neural response of female
   song sparrows to conspecific song
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
AB In songbirds, both song production and song preferences may be
   influenced by early-life experience. Early-life stress impairs
   development of the song-control brain regions and permanently affects
   male song production. However, few studies have examined the effects of
   early-life stress on female song preferences or the brains of female
   songbirds. We exposed female song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, to
   stressors (food restriction or exogenous corticosterone treatment) early
   in development. When birds were adults, we determined the effects of the
   stressors on: (1) the behavioural response to high-complexity versus low
   complexity-songs as well as to conspecific versus heterospecific songs;
   (2) the volume of song-control brain regions; and (3) the immediate
   early gene (Zenk) response in auditory forebrain regions following
   exposure to either conspecific or heterospecific song. We found no
   significant effect of developmental stress on the strength of the
   behavioural response to high-versus low-complexity song, but control
   females showed more selectivity in their behavioural response to
   conspecific versus heterospecific song when compared with
   food-restricted or corticosterone-treated birds. We observed no effect
   of either stressor on volume of the song-control nuclei. Control females
   exposed to conspecific song had more Zenk-immunoreactive cells in the
   auditory brain regions than control females exposed to heterospecific
   song. In contrast, food-restricted and corticosterone-treated females
   did not have more Zenk-immunoreactive cells after exposure to
   conspecific song. These results show that stressors known to affect male
   song production might also affect neural processing of song by females,
   and their subsequent behavioural response to song. (C) 2013 The

TI How body size and development biased the direction of evolution in early
   amphibians
SO HISTORICAL BIOLOGY
AB Evolutionary change does not proceed in every direction with equal
   probability. Evolutionary biases or constraints are limitations on the
   mode, direction and tempo of evolution. Early tetrapods provide
   interesting examples, especially Paleozoic and Mesozoic amphibians. (1)
   Body size had a strong impact on morphology and development in early
   amphibians, resulting in manifold convergences imposed by design
   limitations. Miniaturisation had similar effects in a wide range of
   Paleozoic tetrapods, which are consistent with observations on extant
   salamanders. Gigantism was a common feature of Triassic temnospondyls,
   correlating with slow developmental rates similar to those of gigantic
   salamanders and the convergent evolution of bone density. (2) Ontogeny
   imposes constraints on evolution by canalised (buffered) developmental
   sequences. In Paleozoic temnospondyls, ontogenetic trajectories evolved
   by several different modes (truncation of the trajectory, shifting of
   events or condensation of events). Metamorphosis is an extreme example
   of a condensed developmental sequence, which first evolved in Paleozoic
   temnospondyls, increased in salamanders and culminated in anurans. It
   imposes strong biases that may be broken by three conceivable modes: (1)
   loss of the adult period (neoteny), (2) loss of the larval period
   (direct development) and (3) unpacking' of metamorphosis by re-evolving
   the plesiomorphic trajectory.

TI Retinoic acid dependent histone 3 demethylation of the clustered HOX
   genes during neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY-BIOCHIMIE ET BIOLOGIE CELLULAIRE
AB Gene activation of HOX clusters is an early event in embryonic
   development. These genes are highly expressed and active in the
   vertebrate nervous system. Based on the presence of retinoic acid
   response elements (RAREs) in the regulatory region of many of the HOX
   genes, it is deduced that retinoic acid (RA) can influence epigenetic
   regulation and consequently the expression pattern of HOX during
   RA-induced differentiation of embryonic model systems. In this
   investigation, the expression level as well as the epigenetic regulation
   of several HOX genes of the 4 A-D clusters was analyzed in human
   embryonic stem cells, and also through their neural induction, in the
   presence and absence of RA. Expression analysis data significantly
   showed increased mRNA levels of all examined HOX genes in the presence
   of RA. Epigenetic analysis of the HOX gene regulatory regions also
   showed a significant decrease in methylation of histone H3K27 parallel
   to an absolute preferential incorporation of the demethylase UTX rather
   than JMJD3 in RA-induced neural differentiated cells. This finding
   clearly showed the functional role of UTX in epigenetic alteration of
   HOX clusters during RA-induced neural differentiation; the activity
   could not be detectable for the demethylase JMJD3 during this
   developmental process.

TI Epigenetic modifications by dietary phytochemicals: Implications for
   personalized nutrition
SO PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
AB In the last two decades, the study of epigenetic modification emerged as
   one of the major areas of cancer treatment targeted by dietary
   phytochemicals. Recent studies with various types of cancers revealed
   that the epigenetic modifications are associated with the food source
   corresponds to dietary phytochemicals. The dietary phytochemicals have
   been used in Asian countries for thousands of years to cure several
   diseases including cancer. They have been reported to modulate the
   several biological processes including histone modification, DNA
   methylation and non-coding microRNA expression. These events play a
   vital role in carcinogenesis. Various studies suggest that a number of
   dietary compounds present in vegetables, spices and other herbal
   products have epigenetic targets in cancer cells. Dietary phytochemicals
   have been reported to repair DNA damage by enhancing histone acetylation
   that helps to restrain cell death, and also alter DNA methylation. These
   phytochemicals are able to modulate epigenetic modifications and their
   targets to cure several cancers. Epigenetic aberrations dynamically
   contribute to cancer pathogenesis. Given the individualized traits of
   epigenetic biomarkers, the personalized nutrition will help us to
   prevent various types of cancer. In this review, we will discuss the
   effect of dietary phytochemicals on genetic and epigenetic modifications
   and how these modifications help to prevent various types of cancers and
   improve health outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) suppresses food intake and energy
   expenditure in mice by directly activating the Pomc promoter
SO DIABETOLOGIA
AB While chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with obesity, acute
   inflammation reduces food intake and leads to negative energy balance.
   Although both types of inflammation activate nuclear factor kappa B
   (NF-kappa B) signalling, it remains unclear how NF-kappa B activation
   results in opposite physiological responses in the two types of
   inflammation. The goal of this study was to address this question, and
   to understand the link between inflammation and leptin signalling.
   We studied the ability of NF-kappa B to modulate Pomc transcription, and
   how it impinges on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
   (STAT3)-mediated leptin signalling by using a combination of animal
   models, biochemical assays and molecular biology.
   We report that suppression of food intake and physical movement with
   acute inflammation is not dependent on STAT3 activation in
   pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Under these conditions, activated
   NF-kappa B independently leads to increased Pomc transcription.
   Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation
   (ChIP) experiments reveal that NF-kappa B v-rel reticuloendotheliosis
   viral oncogene homologue A (avian) (RELA [also known as p65]) binds to
   the Pomc promoter region between -138 and -88 bp, which also harbours
   the trans-acting transcription factor 1 (SP1) binding site. We found
   significant changes in the methylation pattern at this region and
   reduced Pomc activation under chronic inflammation induced by a high-fat
   diet. Furthermore, RELA is unable to bind and activate transcription
   when the Pomc promoter is methylated. Finally, RELA binds to STAT3 and
   inhibits STAT3-mediated promoter activity, suggesting that RELA,
   possibly together with forkhead box-containing protein 1 (FOXO1), may
   prevent STAT3-mediated leptin activation of the Pomc promoter.
   Our study provides a mechanism for the involvement of RELA in the
   divergent regulation of energy homeostasis in acute and chronic
   inflammation.

TI Examining the role of endogenous orexins in
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis endocrine function using transient
   dual orexin receptor antagonism in the rat
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The orexin neuropeptide system regulates wakefulness and contributes to
   physiological and behavioral stress responses. Moreover, a role for
   orexins in modulating hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity
   has been proposed. Brain penetrating dual orexin receptor (OXR)
   antagonists such as almorexant decrease vigilance and have emerged as a
   novel therapeutic class for the treatment of insomnia. Almorexant was
   used here as a pharmacological tool to examine the role of endogenous
   orexin signaling in HPA axis endocrine function under natural
   conditions. After confirming the expression of prepro-orexin and OXR-1
   and OXR-2 mRNA in hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal glands, the
   effects of systemic almorexant were investigated on peripheral HPA axis
   hormone release in the rat under baseline, stress and pharmacological
   challenge conditions. Almorexant did not alter basal or stress-induced
   corticosterone release despite affecting wake and sleep stages (detected
   by radiotelemetric electroencephalography/electromyography) during the
   stress exposure. Moreover, almorexant did not affect the release of
   adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone at different time points
   along the diurnal rhythm, nor corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-
   and ACTH-stimulated neuroendocrine responses, measured in vivo under
   stress-free conditions. These results illustrate that dual OXR
   antagonists, despite modulating stress-induced wakefulness, do not
   interfere with endocrine HPA axis function in the rat. They converge to
   suggest that endogenous orexin signaling plays a minor role in stress
   hormone release under basal conditions and under challenge. (c) 2012

TI Evaluation of Novel Disposable, Light-Weight Radiation Protection
   Devices in an Interventional Radiology Setting: A Randomized Controlled
   Trial
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
AB OBJECTIVE. Radiation exposure to interventionalists is increasing. The
   currently available standard radiation protection devices are heavy and
   do not protect the head of the operator. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effectiveness and comfort of caps and thyroid collars made
   of a disposable, light-weight, lead-free material (XPF) for occupational
   radiation protection in a clinical setting.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Up to two interventional operators were randomized
   to wear a XPF or standard 0.5-mm lead-equivalent thyroid collars in 60
   consecutive endovascular procedures requiring fluoroscopy.
   Simultaneously a XPF cap was worn by all operators. Radiation doses were
   measured using dosimeters placed outside and underneath the caps and
   thyroid collars. Wearing comfort was assessed at the end of each
   procedure on a visual analog scale (0-100 [100 = optimal]).
   RESULTS. Patient and procedure data did not differ between the XPF and
   standard protection groups. The cumulative radiation dose measured
   outside the cap was 15,700 mu Sv and outside the thyroid collars 21,240
   mu Sv. Measured radiation attenuation provided by the XPF caps (n = 70),
   XPF thyroid collars (n = 40), and standard thyroid collars (n = 38) was
   85.4% +/- 25.6%, 79.7% +/- 25.8% and 71.9% +/- 34.2%, respectively (mean
   difference XPF vs standard thyroid collars, 7.8% [95% CI, -5.9% to
   21.6%]; p = 0.258). The median XPF cap weight was 144 g (interquartile
   range, 128-170 g), and the XPF thyroid collars were 27% lighter than the
   standard thyroid collars (p < 0.0001). Operators rated the comfort of
   all devices as high (mean scores for XPF caps and XPF thyroid collars
   83.4 +/- 12.7 (SD) and 88.5 +/- 14.6, respectively; mean scores for
   standard thyroid collars 89.6 +/- 9.9) (p = 0.648).
   CONCLUSION. Light-weight disposable caps and thyroid collars made of XPF
   were assessed as being comfortable to wear, and they provide radiation
   protection similar to that of standard 0.5-mm lead-equivalent thyroid
   collars.

TI Association of Thyroid, Breast and Renal Cell Cancer: A Population-based
   Study of the Prevalence of Second Malignancies
SO ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Analysis of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology,
   and End Results data has shown that the incidence of thyroid cancer is
   higher in patients with a preexisting malignancy and that the incidence
   of other malignancies is higher in patients with thyroid cancer. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of a second
   malignancy in patients treated for thyroid, breast or renal cell cancer
   and determine what associations, if any, exist between these cancers.
   This study utilized the novel data system, Explorys, as its population
   base. Patient cohorts were constructed using ICD-9 codes, and prevalence
   rates were obtained for each cancer. Rates of second malignancy were
   obtained and compared to the baseline prevalence for a particular
   malignancy.
   Female thyroid cancer patients had a 0.67- and twofold increase in
   prevalence of a subsequent breast and renal cell cancer. Female breast
   and renal cell cancer patients had a twofold and 1.5-fold increase in
   the prevalence of thyroid cancer, respectively. Male patients with
   thyroid cancer had a 29- and 4.5-fold increase in prevalence of
   subsequent breast and renal cell cancer. Male patients with breast and
   renal cell cancer had an increased prevalence of subsequent thyroid
   cancer, 19- and threefold, respectively.
   Our study demonstrated a bidirectional association between thyroid,
   breast and renal cancer in both male and female patients. This may have
   important implications for patient follow-up and screening after
   treatment of a primary cancer.

TI Histone 3 Lysine 9 Trimethylation Is Differentially Associated With
   Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutations in Oligodendrogliomas and High-Grade
   Astrocytomas
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
AB Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is a marker of repressed
   transcription. Cells transfected with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase
   (IDH) show increased methylation of histone lysine residues, including
   H3K9me3, because of inhibition of histone demethylases by
   2-hydroxyglutarate. Here, we evaluated H3K9me3 and its association with
   IDH mutations in 284 gliomas. Trimethylation of H3K9 was significantly
   associated with IDH mutations in oligodendrogliomas. Moreover, 72% of
   World Health Organization grade II and 65% of grade III
   oligodendrogliomas showed combined H3K9me3 positivity and 1p19q
   codeletion. In astrocytic tumors, H3K9me3 positivity was found in all
   grades of tumors; it showed a significant relationship with IDH
   mutational status in grade II astrocytomas but not in grade III
   astrocytomas or glioblastomas. Finally, H3K9me3-positive grade II
   oligodendrogliomas, but not other tumor subtypes, showed improved
   overall survival compared with H3K9me3-negative cases. These results
   suggest that repressive trimethylation of H3K9 in gliomas may occur in a
   context-dependent manner and is associated with IDH mutations in
   oligodendrogliomas but may be differently regulated in high-grade
   astrocytic tumors. Furthermore, H3K9me3 may define a subset of grade II
   oligodendrogliomas with better overall survival. Our results suggest
   variable roles for IDH mutations in the pathogenesis of
   oligodendrogliomas versus astrocytic tumors.

AB Objectives/Hypothesis: To define molecular biology in clinical practice
   for diagnosis, surgical management, and prognostication of
   differentiated thyroid cancer. Data Sources: Ovid Medline 2006-2012
   Review Methods: Manuscripts with clinical correlates. Results: Papillary
   thyroid carcinomas harbor point mutations of the BRAF and RAS genes or
   RET/PTC rearrangements, all of which activate the mitogen-activated
   protein kinase pathway. These mutually exclusive mutations are found in
   70% of PTC. BRAF mutation is found in 45% of papillary thyroid cancer
   and is highly specific. Follicular carcinomas are known to harbor RAS
   mutation or PAX8/PPAR rearrangement. These mutations are also mutually
   exclusive and identified in 70% of follicular carcinomas. Molecular
   classifiers measure the expression of a large number of genes on a
   microarray chip providing a substantial negative predictive value
   pending further validation. Conclusions: 1) 20% to 30% of cytologically
   classified Follicular Neoplasms and Follicular Lesion of Undetermined
   Significance collectively are malignant on final pathology.
   Approximately 70% to 80% of thyroid lobectomies performed solely for
   diagnostic purposes are benign. Molecular alteration testing may reduce
   the number of unnecessary thyroid procedures, 2) may reduce the number
   of completion thyroidectomies, and 3) may lead to more individualized
   operative and postoperative management. Molecular testing for BRAF, RAS,
   RET/PTC, and PAX8/PPAR for follicular lesion of undetermined
   significance and follicular neoplasm improve specificity, whereas
   molecular classifiers may add negative predictive value to fine needle
   aspiration diagnosis.

TI Robust image metamorphosis immune from ghost and blur
SO VISUAL COMPUTER
AB In this paper, we propose a novel method for the metamorphosis between
   two different images. By the approach, the transition sequence is
   generated by stitching two forward and backward warped sequences in a
   three-dimensional space along transition surface. In contrast to the
   traditional methods by blending two warped images at each intermediate
   frame, we continuously warp images on opposite direction without
   blending until the two warped images match in a three-dimensional space
   leading to a better transition in quality. Furthermore, for each pixel,
   we make decision of choosing a given input image best suitable so as to
   produce plausible in-between images to prevent from ghost and blur. By
   our scheme, the transition surface is computed by minimizing an energy
   function in terms of graph-cut optimization. Depending on the transition
   surface, a warp function is proposed to create a smooth and clear
   transformation. We demonstrate the advantage of our framework by
   performing transformation test to various kinds of image couples.

TI Methanol conversion to olefins (MTO) over H-ZSM-5: Evidence of product
   distribution governed by methanol conversion
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Methanol conversion to olefins (MTO) was investigated in an isotherm
   fixed-bed reactor at methanol partial pressures ranging from 5 to 50
   kPa, water/methanol ratios from 0 to 9 and temperatures from 380 degrees
   C to 460 degrees C over H-ZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/AI ratio of 200.
   Product distribution was affected by operation conditions remarkably
   only at low methanol conversions (<80%). When methanol conversion
   approaches 100%, product distribution is hardly affected by operation
   conditions. In addition, it was always found that propylene selectivity
   is enhanced at the expense of hexenes at high methanol conversions. The
   dependence of product distribution on methanol conversion derives from
   the change of dominant reaction pathway from olefin methylation and
   cracking to oligomerization and cracking. Product distribution at low
   methanol conversions may be determined by the relative rate between
   olefin methylation and cracking, while at complete methanol conversion
   product distribution is determined by oligomerization and cracking of
   C-4(=)-C-7(=) likely. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Histone Chaperones Nap1 and Vps75 Regulate Histone Acetylation during
   Transcription Elongation
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB Histone chaperones function in chromatin assembly and disassembly,
   suggesting they have important regulatory roles in transcription
   elongation. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Nap1 and Vps75 are
   structurally related, evolutionarily conserved histone chaperones. We
   showed that Nap1 genetically interacts with several transcription
   elongation factors and that both Nap1 and Vps75 interact with the RNA
   polymerase II kinase, CTK1. Loss of NAP1 or VPS75 suppressed cryptic
   transcription within the open reading frame (ORF) observed when strains
   are deleted for the kinase CTK1. Loss of the histone acetyltransferase
   Rtt109 also suppressed ctk1-dependent cryptic transcription. Vps75
   regulates Rtt109 function, suggesting that they function together in
   this process. Histone H3 K9 was found to be the important lysine that is
   acetylated by Rtt109 during ctk1-dependent cryptic transcription. We
   showed that both Vps75 and Nap1 regulate the relative level of H3 K9
   acetylation in the STE11 ORF. This supports a model in which Nap1, like
   Vps75, directly regulates Rtt109 activity or regulates the assembly of
   acetylated chromatin. Although Nap1 and Vps75 share many similarities,
   due to their distinct interactions with SET2, Nap1 and Vps75 may also
   play separate roles during transcription elongation. This work sheds
   further light on the importance of histone chaperones as general
   regulators of transcription elongation.

SO CYTOPATHOLOGY
AB G. C. H. Yang, K. Fried and P. H. Levine Detection of medullary thyroid
   microcarcinoma using ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology
   Objective: Compared with incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma
   (microPTC), incidental medullary thyroid microcarcinoma (microMTC) is
   clinically more significant. The objective of the present study was to
   summarize our experience in detecting microMTCs. Methods: From 1995 to
   2011, there were 10825 thyroid fine needle aspirates (FNAs) guided using
   high-resolution ultrasound with on-site preparation and evaluation by a
   cytopathologist. Of the 140 microcarcinomas detected, 132 were microPTCs
   and eight were microMTCs, which are the subject of the present study.
   Results: All eight cases were incidentalomas and none of the five women
   and three men, age 3770years, had a family history of MTC. One patient
   had two FNAs at an interval of 10months, two had a single lymph node
   metastasis and one had a 0.1-cm tumour nodule near the main tumour. Four
   of five plasmacytoid cell microMCTs had irregular borders; two round
   cell and one rectangular cell tumours had smooth borders. In contrast,
   17 larger MTCs diagnosed in the same period included seven plasmacytoid,
   four giant cell and six spindle cell types. All five plasmacytoid
   microMTCs were correctly diagnosed on FNA, but the round cell and
   rectangular cell tumours were undercalled as follicular lesions.
   Sampling of colloid from adjacent follicles was noted in microMTCs. Two
   were diagnosed on histology following recommended surgery and one was
   diagnosed on recommended repeat FNA. Conclusions: US-guided FNA of
   thyroid lesions is a powerful tool in the detection of microMTCs,
   provided that cytopathologists are alerted to the pitfalls described in
   the present study.

TI Primary peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified of the
   thyroid with autoimmune thyroiditis
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY
AB Primary peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS)
   of the thyroid is an extremely rare neoplasm. Six cases of primary
   PTCL-NOS of the thyroid were analysed for clinicopathological features
   and genomic alteration patterns using oligo-array comparative genomic
   hybridization. All patients had a diffusely enlarged thyroid and three
   cases showed leukaemic manifestation. Five of the six cases had
   anti-thyroid antibodies and the remaining case showed hypothyroidism,
   suggesting that all cases had autoimmune thyroiditis. Except for one
   early relapsed case, the remaining five patients are alive and three of
   these five individuals have survived for 70months or more.
   Interestingly, two cases showed spontaneous regressions after partial
   thyroid biopsy without any therapy. Leukaemic manifestation disappeared
   after irradiation of the thyroid mass in another two cases. The tumour
   cells were positive for CD3, CD4 and CXCR3 in all cases, suggesting that
   the tumour cells are of a type 1 helper T-cell origin. All six cases
   showed genomic alterations that were different from those previously
   reported for PTCL-NOS. The loss of 6q24 center dot 2 was characteristic
   and was detected in four of the six cases. These results suggest that
   primary PTCL-NOS of the thyroid arising from autoimmune thyroiditis is a
   distinct disease entity among heterogeneous PTCL-NOS.

TI The involvement of epigenetic silencing of Foxa2 in cellular replicative
   and premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide
SO FREE RADICAL RESEARCH
AB Foxa2 is one member of the Foxa subfamily of winged helix/forkhead box
   (Fox) transcription factors which has been found to play important roles
   in multiple stages of mammalian life, beginning with early development,
   continuing during organogenesis, and finally in metabolism and
   homeostasis in the adult. To explore the involvement of Foxa2 and its
   epigenetic regulations in cellular senescence, we established the
   premature senescence model induced by hydrogen peroxide in comparison
   with replicative senescence. The mRNA level of Foxa2 was downregulated
   in both replicative and premature senescent cells. We further found the
   increased DNA methylation level and new methylation at CpG sites in the
   promoter with 43.6% of methylated CpG islands in premature senescence,
   while only 5.7% and 17.1% in young cells and replicative senescence
   separately. Moreover, we noted the alterations of histone modifications
   including decreased histone H3 acetylation, increased H4 (Lys-20)
   trimethylation at the Foxa2 CpG islands in the promoter in replicative
   or premature senescence, while decreased histone H3 (Lys-4)
   trimethylation across the transcription start regions in cellular
   senescence. Taken together, epigenetic silencing of Foxa2 is associated
   with an increased DNA methylation level and histone H4 (Lys-20)
   trimethylation, decreased histone H3 acetylation and histone H3 (Lys-4)
   trimethylation, involved in cellular replicative or premature
   senescence.

TI Promoter Methylation Regulates SAMHD1 Gene Expression in Human CD4(+) T
   Cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The retrovirus restriction factor SAMHD1 is the first identified
   mammalian dNTP triphosphohydrolase that is highly expressed in human
   myeloid lineage cells and CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Although SAMHD1
   expression is variable in human cell lines and tissue types, mechanisms
   underlying SAMHD1 gene regulation have not been defined. Recent studies
   showed that SAMHD1 is highly expressed in human primary CD4(+) T
   lymphocytes, but not in some CD4(+) T cell lines. Here, we report that
   SAMHD1 expression varies among four CD4(+) T cell lines and is
   transcriptionally regulated. Cloning and sequence analysis of the human
   SAMHD1 promoter revealed a CpG island that is methylated in CD4(+) T
   cell lines (such as Jurkat and Sup-T1), resulting in transcriptional
   repression of SAMHD1. We also found that the SAMHD1 promoter is
   unmethylated in primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which express high levels
   of SAMHD1, indicating a direct correlation between the methylation of
   the SAMHD1 promoter and transcriptional repression. SAMHD1 expression
   was induced in CD4(+) T cell lines by blocking DNA methyltransferase
   activity, suggesting that promoter methylation is one of the key
   epigenetic mechanisms by which SAMHD1 expression is regulated.

TI Fbxl10/kdm2b Recruits Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 to CpG Islands and
   Regulates H2A Ubiquitylation
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) catalyzes lysine 119
   monoubiquitylation on H2A (H2AK119ub1) and regulates pluripotency in
   embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the mechanisms controlling the
   binding of PRC1 to genomic sites and its catalytic activity are poorly
   understood. Here, we show that Fbxl10 interacts with Ring1B and Nspc1,
   forming a noncanonical PRC1 that is required for H2AK119ub1 in mouse
   ESCs. Genome-wide analyses reveal that Fbxl10 preferentially binds to
   CpG islands and colocalizes with Ring1B on Polycomb target genes.
   Notably, Fbxl10 depletion causes a decrease in Ring1B binding to target
   genes and a major loss of H2AK119ub1. Furthermore, genetic analyses
   demonstrate that Fbxl10 DNA binding capability and integration into PRC1
   are required for H2AK119 ubiquitylation. ESCs lacking Fbxl10, like
   previously characterized Polycomb mutants, cannot differentiate
   properly. These results demonstrate that Fbxl10 has a key role in
   regulating Ring1B recruitment to its target genes and H2AK119
   ubiquitylation in ESCs.

TI Epigenetic regulation of L1CAM in endometrial carcinoma: comparison to
   cancer-testis (CT-X) antigens
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: L1CAM was originally identified as an adhesion molecule
   involved in neural development. In many human carcinomas L1CAM is
   over-expressed and is associated with a bad prognosis. We previously
   reported that L1CAM was absent in the vast majority of endometrioid
   endometrial carcinomas (ECs) (type 1) but was strongly expressed in the
   more aggressive serous and clear-cell ECs (termed type 2). The
   differential regulation of L1CAM in ECs is not well understood. Recent
   evidence suggests that it can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.
   Here we investigated the role of DNA-methylation of the L1CAM promoter
   for expression. We also studied the relationship to cancer testis (CT-X)
   antigens that co-localize with L1CAM on chromosome Xq28, a region that
   is often activated in human tumors.
   Methods: We used EC cell lines and primary tumor tissues for our
   analysis. For expression analysis we employed RT-PCR and Western
   blotting. DNA-Methylation of the L1CAM promoter was determined after
   bisulfite conversation and DNA sequencing. Tumor tissues were examined
   by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.
   Results: We demonstrate that the treatment of L1CAM low/negative
   expressing EC cell lines with 5'-Azacytidine (5-AzaC) or knock-down of
   DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) as well as the HDAC (histone
   deacetylase) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) up-regulated L1CAM at the
   mRNA and protein level. The L1CAM gene has two promoter regions with two
   distinct CpG islands. We observed that the expression of L1CAM
   correlated with hypermethylation in promoter 1 and 5-AzaC treatment
   affected the DNA-methylation pattern in this region. The CT-X antigens
   NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 were also strongly up-regulated by 5-AzaC
   or knock-down of DNMT1 but did not respond to treatment with TSA.
   Primary EC tumor tissues showed a variable methylation pattern of the
   L1CAM promoter. No striking differences in promoter methylation were
   observed between tumor areas with L1CAM expression and those without
   expression.
   Conclusions: L1CAM expression correlated with methylation of the L1CAM
   promoter in EC cell lines. In negative cell lines L1CAM expression is
   up-regulated by epigenetic mechanism. Although genes localized on Xq28
   are often re-expressed by human tumors, L1CAM and CT-X antigens show
   distinct regulation in response to HADC inhibitors and 5-AzaC.

TI Progress in molecular-based management of differentiated thyroid cancer
SO LANCET
AB Substantial developments have occurred in the past 5-10 years in
   clinical translational research of thyroid cancer. Diagnostic molecular
   markers, such as RET-PTC, RAS, and BRAF(V600E) mutations; galectin 3;
   and a new gene expression classifier, are outstanding examples that have
   improved diagnosis of thyroid nodules. BRAF mutation is a prognostic
   genetic marker that has improved risk stratification and hence tailored
   management of patients with thyroid cancer, including those with
   conventionally low risks. Novel molecular-targeted treatments hold great
   promise for radioiodine-refractory and surgically inoperable thyroid
   cancers as shown in clinical trials; such treatments are likely to
   become a component of the standard treatment regimen for patients with
   thyroid cancer in the near future. These novel molecular-based

TI Stress hormones promote growth of B16-F10 melanoma metastases: an
   interleukin 6-and glutathione-dependent mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Interleukin (IL)-6 (mainly of tumor origin) activates
   glutathione (GSH) release from hepatocytes and its interorgan transport
   to B16-F10 melanoma metastatic foci. We studied if this capacity to
   overproduce IL-6 is regulated by cancer cell-independent mechanisms.
   Methods: Murine B16-F10 melanoma cells were cultured, transfected with
   red fluorescent protein, injected i.v. into syngenic C57BL/6J mice to
   generate lung and liver metastases, and isolated from metastatic foci
   using high-performance cell sorting. Stress hormones and IL-6 levels
   were measured by ELISA, and CRH expression in the brain by in situ
   hybridization. DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B, CREB, AP-1, and
   NF-IL-6 was measured using specific transcription factor assay kits.
   IL-6 expression was measured by RT-PCR, and silencing was achieved by
   transfection of anti-IL-6 small interfering RNA. GSH was determined by
   HPLC. Cell death analysis was distinguished using fluorescence
   microscopy, TUNEL labeling, and flow cytometry techniques. Statistical
   analyses were performed using Student's t test.
   Results: Plasma levels of stress-related hormones (adrenocorticotropin
   hormone, corticosterone, and noradrenaline) increased, following a
   circadian pattern and as compared to non-tumor controls, in mice bearing
   B16-F10 lung or liver metastases. Corticosterone and noradrenaline, at
   pathophysiological levels, increased expression and secretion of IL-6 in
   B16-F10 cells in vitro. Corticosterone- and noradrenaline-induced
   transcriptional up-regulation of IL-6 gene involves changes in the DNA
   binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B, cAMP response
   element-binding protein, activator protein-1, and nuclear factor for
   IL-6. In vivo inoculation of B16-F10 cells transfected with
   anti-IL-6-siRNA, treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor blocker
   (RU-486) or with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol), increased
   hepatic GSH whereas decreased plasma IL-6 levels and metastatic growth.
   Corticosterone, but not NORA, also induced apoptotic cell death in
   metastatic cells with low GSH content.
   Conclusions: Our results describe an interorgan system where
   stress-related hormones, IL-6, and GSH coordinately regulate metastases
   growth.

TI Evaluation of the relationship between dietary factors, CagA-positive
   Helicobacter pylori infection, and RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation in
   gastric cancer tissue
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: To evaluate the relationship among Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
   infection, CagA status, and dietary factors with RUNX3 promoter
   hypermethylation.
   METHODS: Gastric cancer tissue samples were collected from 184 South
   Korean patients. All patients were interviewed following a
   semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The average frequencies
   of intake and portion sizes of 89 common food items were documented, and
   total intakes of calories, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals were
   calculated for each subject. DNA was extracted from gastric cancer
   tissue samples, and amplification of the HSP60 gene was performed to
   detect H. pylori infection. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
   used to detect the presence of the CagA gene. RUNX3 gene expression was
   measured by reverse transcription-PCR, and RUNX3 methylation status was
   evaluated by methylation-specific PCR. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95%CI
   associated with RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation status were estimated
   for each of the food groups, lifestyle factors, and the interaction
   between dietary and lifestyle factors with CagA status of H. pylori
   infection.
   RESULTS: Overall, 164 patients (89.1%) were positive for H. pylori DNA,
   with the CagA gene detected in 59 (36%) of these H. pylori-positive
   samples. In all, 106 (57.6%) patients with gastric cancer demonstrated
   CpG island hypermethylation at the RUNX3 promoter. RUNX3 expression was
   undetectable in 52 (43.7%) of the 119 gastric cancer tissues sampled. A
   high consumption of eggs may increase the risk of RUNX3 methylation in
   gastric cancer patients, having a mean OR of 2.15 (range, 1.14-4.08). A
   significantly increased OR of 4.28 (range, 1.19-15.49) was observed with
   a high consumption of nuts in patients with CagA-positive H. pylori
   infection. High intakes of carbohydrate, vitamin B1, and vitamin E may
   decrease the risk of RUNX3 methylation in gastric cancer tissue,
   particularly in CagA- or H. pylori-negative infection, with OR of 0.41
   (0.19-0.90), 0.42 (0.20-0.89), and 0.29 (0.13-0.62), respectively. A
   high consumption of fruits may protect against RUNX3 methylation.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the CagA status of H. pylori
   infection may be a modifier of dietary effects on RUNX3 methylation in
   gastric cancer tissue. (C) 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

   metaphase spindle are critical to the fidelity of chromosome
   segregation. Active force interplay exists between predominantly
   extensional microtubule-based spindle forces and restoring forces from
   chromatin. These forces regulate tension at the kinetochore that
   silences the spindle assembly checkpoint to ensure faithful chromosome
   segregation. Depletion of pericentric cohesin or condensin has been
   shown to increase the mean and variance of spindle length, which have
   been attributed to a softening of the linear chromatin spring. Models of
   the spindle apparatus with linear chromatin springs that match spindle
   dynamics fail to predict the behavior of pericentromeric chromatin in
   wild-type and mutant spindles. We demonstrate that a nonlinear spring
   with a threshold extension to switch between spring states predicts
   asymmetric chromatin stretching observed in vivo. The addition of
   cross-links between adjacent springs recapitulates coordination between
   pericentromeres of neighboring chromosomes.

TI Myeloma Is Characterized by Stage-Specific Alterations in DNA
   Methylation That Occur Early during Myelomagenesis
SO JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Epigenetic changes play important roles in carcinogenesis and influence
   initial steps in neoplastic transformation by altering genome stability
   and regulating gene expression. To characterize epigenomic changes
   during the transformation of normal plasma cells to myeloma, we modified
   the HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR assay to
   work with small numbers of purified primary marrow plasma cells. The
   nano-HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR assay was
   used to analyze the methylome of CD138(+) cells from 56 subjects
   representing premalignant (monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain
   significance), early, and advanced stages of myeloma, as well as healthy
   controls. Plasma cells from premalignant and early stages of myeloma
   were characterized by striking, widespread hypomethylation.
   Gene-specific hypermethylation was seen to occur in the advanced stages,
   and cell lines representative of relapsed cases were found to be
   sensitive to decitabine. Aberrant demethylation in monoclonal gammopathy
   of uncertain significance occurred primarily in CpG islands, whereas
   differentially methylated loci in cases of myeloma occurred
   predominantly outside of CpG islands and affected distinct sets of gene
   pathways, demonstrating qualitative epigenetic differences between
   premalignant and malignant stages. Examination of the methylation
   machinery revealed that the methyltransferase, DNMT3A, was aberrantly
   hypermethylated and underexpressed, but not mutated in myeloma. DNMT3A
   underexpression was also associated with adverse overall survival in a
   large cohort of patients, providing insights into genesis of
   hypomethylation in myeloma. These results demonstrate widespread,
   stage-specific epigenetic changes during myelomagenesis and suggest that
   early demethylation can be a potential contributor to genome instability
   seen in myeloma. We also identify DNMT3A expression as a novel
   prognostic biomarker and suggest that relapsed cases can be
   therapeutically targeted by hypomethylating agents. The Journal of
   Immunology, 2013, 190: 2966-2975.

TI The Genetic Basis for Bacterial Mercury Methylation
SO SCIENCE
AB Methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin produced in natural environments
   from inorganic mercury by anaerobic bacteria. However, until now the
   genes and proteins involved have remained unidentified. Here, we report
   a two-gene cluster, hgcA and hgcB, required for mercury methylation by
   Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. In
   either bacterium, deletion of hgcA, hgcB, or both genes abolishes
   mercury methylation. The genes encode a putative corrinoid protein,
   HgcA, and a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin, HgcB, consistent with roles as a
   methyl carrier and an electron donor required for corrinoid cofactor
   reduction, respectively. Among bacteria and archaea with sequenced
   genomes, gene orthologs are present in confirmed methylators but absent
   in nonmethylators, suggesting a common mercury methylation pathway in
   all methylating bacteria and archaea sequenced to date.

TI Physiological responses of Xenopus laevis tadpoles exposed to
   cyanobacterial biomass containing microcystin-LR
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB Cyanobacteria are the primary biomass producers and some species
   synthesize remarkable amounts of secondary metabolites, the so-called
   cyanotoxins. Several reports deal with the most common cyanotoxins,
   microcystins (MCs), and their effects on fishes but only a few studies
   investigated a natural exposure to MCs and limited information is
   available concerning the further aquatic vertebrate class, amphibians.
   In the present study, Xenopus laevis tadpoles at stage 52 (Nieuwkoop and
   Faber, 1994) were exposed for 1, 3, 7, and 21 days to diets containing
   lyophilized cyanobacterial biomass without and with microcystin-LR
   (MC-LR) at concentrations of 42.8 and 187.0 mu g MC-LR/g diet,
   respectively, to determine impacts on MC-LR bioaccumulation,
   development, stress, and biotransformation. The fate of MC-LR present in
   diet and water was determined in whole body using liquid chromatography
   with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Effects on development were
   assessed by recording mortality, weight and developmental stage. In
   parallel, mRNA levels of hypophyseal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
   associated with metamorphosis and of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone
   and follicle stimulating hormone, triggering sexual differentiation,
   were assessed. Concerning stress, corticosteroid levels and mRNA
   expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as stress biomarkers were
   examined. Furthermore, mRNA expression of biotransformation enzymes of
   all three phases as well as biomarkers for oxidative stress were
   determined.
   Surprisingly, exposure to cyanobacterial biomass containing MC-LR
   supplied via diet as natural exposure neither resulted in measurable
   bioaccumulation of MC-LR nor affected dramatically development. Only
   minor to negligible physiological impacts on development, stress, and
   biotransformation mechanisms were found suggesting that X. laevis
   tadpoles seem to have some mechanisms to be able to cope quite well with
   diets containing lyophilized cyanobacterial biomass even with
   considerable amounts of MC-LR. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Epigenetics of Reprogramming to Induced Pluripotency
SO CELL
AB Reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) proceeds in a
   stepwise manner with reprogramming factor binding, transcription, and
   chromatin states changing during transitions. Evidence is emerging that
   epigenetic priming events early in the process may be critical for
   pluripotency induction later. Chromatin and its regulators are important
   controllers of reprogramming, and reprogramming factor levels,
   stoichiometry, and extracellular conditions influence the outcome. The
   rapid progress in characterizing reprogramming is benefiting
   applications of iPSCs and is already enabling the rational design of
   novel reprogramming factor cocktails. However, recent studies have also
   uncovered an epigenetic instability of the X chromosome in human iPSCs
   that warrants careful consideration.

TI Patterns of population epigenomic diversity
SO NATURE
AB Natural epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of
   phenotypic diversity, but to understand its contribution to such
   diversity, its interaction with genetic variation requires further
   investigation. Here we report population-wide DNA sequencing of genomes,
   transcriptomes and methylomes of wild Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.
   Single cytosine methylation polymorphisms are not linked to genotype.
   However, the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay amongst differentially
   methylated regions targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation is similar
   to the rate for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association analyses of
   these RNA-directed DNA methylation regions with genetic variants
   identified thousands of methylation quantitative trait loci, which
   revealed the population estimate of genetically dependent methylation
   variation. Analysis of invariably methylated transposons and genes
   across this population indicates that loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA
   methylation are epigenetically activated in pollen and seeds, which
   facilitates proper development of these structures.

TI IGFBP-3 methylation-derived deficiency mediates the resistance to
   cisplatin through the activation of the IGFIR/Akt pathway in non-small
   cell lung cancer
SO ONCOGENE
AB Although many cancers initially respond to cisplatin (CDDP)-based
   chemotherapy, resistance frequently develops. Insulin-like growth
   factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) silencing by promoter methylation is
   involved in the CDDP-acquired resistance process in non-small cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC) patients. Our purpose is to design a translational-based
   profile to predict resistance in NSCLC by studying the role of IGFBP-3
   in the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. We have
   first examined the relationship between IGFBP-3 expression regulated by
   promoter methylation and activation of the epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGFIR) and
   PI3K/AKT pathways in 10 human cancer cell lines and 25 NSCLC patients
   with known IGFBP-3 methylation status and response to CDDP. Then, to
   provide a helpful tool that enables clinicians to identify patients with
   a potential response to CDDP, we have calculated the association between
   our diagnostic test and the true outcome of analyzed samples in terms of
   cisplatin IC50; the inhibitory concentration that kills 50% of the cell
   population. Our results suggest that loss of IGFBP-3 expression by
   promoter methylation in tumor cells treated with CDDP may activate the
   PI3K/AKT pathway through the specific derepression of IGFIR signaling,
   inducing resistance to CDDP. This study also provides a predictive test
   for clinical practice with an accuracy and precision of 0.84 and 0.9,
   respectively, (P = 0.0062). We present a biomarker test that could
   provide clinicians with a robust tool with which to decide on the use of
   CDDP, improving patient clinical outcomes.

TI Reduced expression of DACT2 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma
   progression: involvement of methylation-mediated gene silencing
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive
   malignancies in humans, and its prognosis is generally poor even after
   surgery. Many advances have been made to understand the pathogenesis of
   HCC; however, the molecular mechanisms that lead to hepatocarcinogenesis
   and progression are still not clearly understood.
   Methods: The expression of DACT2 in specimens from 30 paired HCCs and an
   additional 61 HCC patients after liver transplantation was evaluated by
   quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. We investigated
   the methylation status of the DACT2 promoter region. We also analyzed
   the alterations of the cell cycle, migration and invasion after DACT2
   knockdown.
   Results: The expression level of DACT2 was significantly lower in HCC
   tissues than in non-cancerous tissues. Reduced DACT2 expression was
   associated with large tumor size. DACT2 transcripts were at low levels
   in hypermethylated liver cancer cells and were restored by exposure to a
   demethylating agent. Reduced expression of DACT2 in MHCC97L cells
   induced G1/S arrest, increased cell proliferation, and promoted cell
   invasion.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that DACT2 is silenced by promoter
   hypermethylation, and reduced DACT2 can promote liver cancer
   progression. DACT2 may serve as a novel tumor suppressor gene in HCC.

TI Dogma Derailed: The Many Influences of RNA on the Genome
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Epigenetic control of gene expression is a critical component of

   modifications is often guided by noncoding RNAs. Although noncoding RNAs
   have been most often implicated in posttranscriptional gene silencing,
   these molecules are now emerging as critical regulators of gene
   expression and genomic stability at the transcriptional level. Here, we
   review recent efforts to understand the mechanisms by which RNA controls
   the expression or content of DNA. We discuss the role of both small RNAs
   and long noncoding RNAs in directing chromatin changes through histone
   modifications and DNA methylation. Furthermore, we highlight the
   function of RNA in mediating DNA cleavage during genome rearrangements
   and pathogen defense. In understanding the mechanisms of RNA control
   over DNA, the power of RNA may one day be harnessed to impact gene
   expression in a therapeutic setting.

TI Antidepressant-like effects of lobeline in mice: Behavioral,

SO PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that neuronal nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonists have antidepressant-like
   properties. The present study examined the effects of lobeline, a nAChR
   antagonist, in the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST),
   and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) of antidepressant efficacy.
   Lobeline (1 or 4 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered 20 min before the FST and
   TST in G7BL/6J mice. Pretreatment with lobeline significantly reduced
   immobility time in the FST but not in the TST. Repeated lobeline (1 or 4
   mg/kg, s.c.) treatment for 21 days significantly reduced feeding latency
   in the NSFT. We also determined the effects of lobeline on forced swim
   stress (FSS)-induced increased in plasma corticosterone levels using
   enzyme immunoassay. Pretreatment with lobeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.)
   significantly attenuated the corticosterone levels. Further, the effects
   of lobeline on FSS-induced increased in norepinephrine (NE) and
   serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were
   determined using high performance liquid chromatography. Pretreatment
   with lobeline (1 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly reduced NE levels in
   the PFC. Overall, the present study indicates that lobeline produces
   antidepressant-like effects by targeting brain nAChRs and/or
   neuroendocrine and brain noradrenergic systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Coenzyme Q10 displays antidepressant-like activity with reduction of
   hippocampal oxidative/nitrosative DNA damage in chronically stressed
   rats
SO PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR
AB Multiple evidences suggest that depression is accompanied by an
   induction of oxidative/nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways and by a
   reduced antioxidant status. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential
   cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport pathway and has a
   powerful antioxidant capacity.
   Methods: This study investigated the effect of chronic treatment with
   CoQ10 (25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg/day, i.p. for 3 weeks) on
   depressive-like behavior and hippocampal, O&NS, and DNA damage, induced
   by chronic restraint stress (CRS), an experimental model of depression,
   in rats.
   Results: CoQ10 showed a significant antidepressant effect, as evidenced
   by amelioration of CRS-induced behavioral aberrations in forced swimming
   and open field tests, elevated corticosterone level and body weight
   loss. Moreover, CoQ10 dose-dependently restored the hippocampal
   catalase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione and decreased
   the hippocampal malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and
   8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels, which indicated a potential
   protective effect of CoQ10 against hippocampal O&NS lipid peroxidation
   and DNA damage.
   Conclusion: CoQ10 possesses antidepressant activity and can protect
   against CRS-induced hippocampal DNA damage which could be mediated in
   part by maintaining mitochondrial function and its well documented
   antioxidant properties. Therefore, CoQ10 may have a potential
   therapeutic value for the management of depressive disorders. However,
   further research, is still required to characterize the mechanism of the
   antidepressant effect of CoQ10 and extend these results before the safe
   application in humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   showed adenomatous goiter containing bilateral metastatic prostatic
   adenocarcinoma. This is the first report of isolated multiple bilateral
   thyroid gland metastasis from prostatic adenocarcinoma without other
   distal metastasis. Such lesions are very rare and can be misdiagnosed,
   so high index of suspicion for thyroid metastasis should be always

TI Body condition influences sexual signal expression independent of
   circulating androgens in male red-backed fairy-wrens
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Androgens play a major role in the regulation of sexual signal
   expression of male vertebrates. In this study we assessed the prevalent,
   yet largely untested, assumption that signal honesty is maintained
   through condition-dependent androgen regulation by experimentally
   manipulating body condition of male red-backed fairy-wrens (Malurus
   melanocephalus) through trimming several flight feathers before the
   prenuptial molt. In their first reproductive season males of this
   species exhibit androgen-regulated plasticity in plumage coloration,
   ranging from red/black (high androgens) to brown (low androgens).
   Red/black plumage is preferred by females and might be constrained by a
   negative relationship between body condition and androgen levels. We
   also evaluated whether corticosterone changes to altered conditional
   state mediate the relationship between condition and androgens. While we
   predicted that males with trimmed feathers would expend greater energy
   and thus be in poorer condition at the time of molt, they were
   counter-intuitively in better condition compared to control birds,
   likely as a consequence of subtle behavioral changes. These birds in
   better condition molted a greater proportion of red/black plumage, as
   predicted, and also molted more heavily. However, experimental and
   control birds did not differ in their androgen or corticosterone
   concentrations. Furthermore, analysis of long-term data from the same
   population revealed no correlation between condition and androgen
   levels. Collectively, these results challenge the notion that
   condition-dependent androgen regulation alone is responsible for
   maintaining the honesty of sexual signals and highlights the necessity
   of considering alternate explanations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI DNA methylation: a matter of culture
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Pluripotent cells have been derived from the inner cell mass of mouse
   embryos and also from primordial germ cells. A new study shows that cell
   lines of both origins exhibit highly similar transcriptomes and
   surprisingly low DNA methylation levels when maintained in culture
   conditions that support naive pluripotency. These 2i conditions thus
   provide a closer approximation of in vivo development and new insights
   into the regulation of DNA methylation.

TI Epigenetic disorders and male subfertility
SO FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB Objective: To provide a link between epigenetics and male subfertility
   at the DNA, histone-protamine, and RNA levels and its consequences on
   fertilization and embryo development.
   Design: Review of the relevant literature.
   Setting: University-based clinical and research laboratories.
   Patient(s): Fertile and infertile men.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Critical review of the literature.
   Result(s): Epigenetic markers can be modified in infertile patients.
   Epigenetic modifications include methylation loss or gain on the global
   level and on imprinted genes, high levels of histone retention in
   spermatozoa, and deficiencies in some transcripts involved in
   spermatogenesis. Interestingly, these abnormalities are all linked
   together, because DNA methylation maintenance depends on DNA
   histone-protamine configuration which itself is stabilized by
   spermatozoal RNAs.
   Conclusion(s): The paternal genome has long been considered to be silent
   and passive in embryo formation. The epigenetic processes associated
   with the paternal DNA genome highlights its importance in male fertility
   as well as for embryo development. (Fertil Steril (R) 2013;99:624-31.

TI Shelter availability, stress level and digestive performance in the
   aspic viper
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The lack of shelter can perturb behaviors, increase stress level and
   thus alter physiological performance (e. g. digestive, immune or
   reproductive functions). Although intuitive, such potential impacts of
   lack of shelter remain poorly documented. We manipulated shelter
   availability and environmental and physiological variables (i.e. access
   to a heat source, predator attack, feeding status) in a viviparous
   snake, and assessed sun-basking behavior, digestive performance (i.e.
   digestive transit time, crude estimate of assimilation, regurgitation
   rate) and plasma corticosterone levels (a proxy of stress level).
   Shelter deprivation provoked a strong increase in sun-basking behavior
   and thus elevated body temperature, even in unfed individuals for which
   energy savings would have been otherwise beneficial. The lack of heat
   was detrimental to digestive performance; simulated predator attacks
   worsened the situation and entailed a further deterioration of
   digestion. The combination of the lack of shelter with cool ambient
   temperatures markedly elevated basal corticosterone level and was
   associated with low digestive performance. This hormonal effect was
   absent when only one negative factor was involved, suggesting a
   threshold response. Overall, our results revealed important non-linear
   cascading impacts of shelter availability on stress-hormone levels,
   behaviors and physiological performance. These results infer that
   shelter availability is important for laboratory studies, captive
   husbandry and possibly conservation plans.

TI Investigations into the differential reactivity of endogenous and
   exogenous mercury species in coastal sediments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Stable isotopic tracer methodologies now allow the evaluation of the
   reactivity of the endogenous (ambient) and exogenous (added) Hg to
   further predict the potential effect of Hg inputs in ecosystems. The
   differential reactivity of endogenous and exogenous Hg was compared in
   superficial sediments collected in a coastal lagoon (Arcachon Bay) and
   in an estuary (Adour River) from the Bay of Biscay (SW France). All Hg
   species (gaseous, aqueous, and solid fraction) and ancillary data were
   measured during time course slurry experiments under variable redox
   conditions. The average endogenous methylation yield was higher in the
   estuarine (1.2 %0 than in the lagoonal sediment (0.5 %), although both
   methylation and demethylation rates were higher in the lagoonal sediment
   in relation with a higher sulfate-reducing activity. Demethylation was
   overall more consistent than methylation in both sediments. The
   endogenous and exogenous Hg behaviors were always correlated but the
   exogenous inorganic Hg (IHg) partitioning into water was 2.0-4.3 times
   higher than the endogenous one. Its methylation was just slightly higher
   (1.4) in the estuarine sediment while the difference in the lagoonal
   sediment was much larger (3.6). The relative endogenous and exogenous
   methylation yields were not correlated to IHg partitioning,
   demonstrating that the bioavailable species distributions were different
   for the two IHg pools. In both sediments, the exogenous IHg partitioning
   equaled the endogenous one within a week, while its higher methylation
   lasted for months. Such results provide an original assessment approach
   to compare coastal sediment response to Hg inputs.

TI Epigenomic plasticity enables human pancreatic alpha to beta cell
   reprogramming
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Insulin-secreting beta cells and glucagon-secreting alpha cells maintain
   physiological blood glucose levels, and their malfunction drives
   diabetes development. Using ChIP sequencing and RNA sequencing analysis,
   we determined the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of human
   pancreatic alpha, beta, and exocrine cells. We found that, compared with
   exocrine and beta cells, differentiated alpha cells exhibited many more
   genes bivalently marked by the activating H3K4me3 and repressing
   H3K27me3 histone modifications. This was particularly true for beta cell
   signature genes involved in transcriptional regulation. Remarkably,
   thousands of these genes were in a monovalent state in beta cells,
   carrying only the activating or repressing mark. Our epigenomic findings
   suggested that alpha to beta cell reprogramming could be promoted by
   manipulating the histone methylation signature of human pancreatic
   islets. Indeed, we show that treatment of cultured pancreatic islets
   with a histone methyltransferase inhibitor leads to colocalization of
   both glucagon and insulin and glucagon and insulin promoter factor 1
   (PDX1) in human islets and colocalization of both glucagon and insulin
   in mouse islets. Thus, mammalian pancreatic islet cells display
   cell-type-specific epigenomic plasticity, suggesting that epigenomic
   manipulation could provide a path to cell reprogramming and novel cell
   replacement-based therapies for diabetes.

TI Not all stressors are equal: Early social enrichment favors resilience
   to social but not physical stress in male mice
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Early experiences profoundly affect the adult coping response to stress
   and, consequently, adult vulnerability to psychopathologies triggered by
   stressing conditions, such as major depression. Though studies in animal
   models have demonstrated that individuals reared in different conditions
   are differently vulnerable to a stressor of a specific quality, no
   information is available as to whether such vulnerability differs when
   facing stressors of different qualities. To this purpose, we reared
   C57BL/6 male mice either in standard laboratory rearing condition (SN)
   or in Communal Nest (CN) condition, the latter consisting of a single
   nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving
   behavior until weaning. We scored the amount of interactions with the
   mother and with peers and found that CN is a form of social enrichment
   because both these components are significantly increased. At adulthood,
   we exposed SN and CN mice, for 4 weeks, to either a physical (forced
   swim) or a social stress (social instability). Immediately before, at
   week 1 and at week 4 of the stress procedure, corticosterone levels and
   the hedonic profile were measured. The results show that CN mice are
   more resilient to social stress than SN mice since they displayed no
   anhedonia and lower corticosterone levels. By contrast, both
   experimental groups were similarly vulnerable to physical stress.
   Overall, our results show that, in male mice, the adult vulnerability to
   stress changes according to the quality of the stressor, as a function
   of early experiences. In addition, the stressor to which CN mice are
   resilient is qualitatively similar to the stimuli they have experienced
   early on, both concerning the social domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

TI OTX2 sustains a bivalent-like state of OTX2-bound promoters in
   medulloblastoma by maintaining their H3K27me3 levels
SO ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)
   demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a
   role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27
   (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors
   compared to WNT and SHH medulloblastomas, also in tumors without
   detectable mutations in demethylases. Here, we report that polycomb
   genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in
   Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high expression of the homeobox
   transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425 medulloblastoma
   cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2, EED,
   SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B,
   JARID2 and KDM7A. This was accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and
   increased H3K27me1 levels in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease
   of H3K27me3 was most prominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound
   promoters showed high levels of the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks
   and intermediate levels of the H3K27me3 inactivation mark, reminiscent
   of a bivalent modification. After silencing of OTX2, H3K27me3 levels
   strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac levels remained high.
   OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression levels in D425, but the
   expression of most of these genes did not change after OTX2 silencing
   and loss of the H3K27me3 mark. Maintaining promoters in a bivalent state
   by sustaining H3K27 trimethylation therefore seems to be an important
   function of OTX2 in medulloblastoma, while other transcription factors
   might regulate the actual expression levels of these genes.

TI Differences in acute stress responses between wild-caught and
   captive-bred birds: a physiological mechanism contributing to current
   avian invasions?
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Current avian invasions are often the result of exotic birds
   accidentally escaping from cages. It has been hypothesised that the
   higher invasiveness of wild-caught cage-birds compared to captive-bred
   ones could be related to the loss of ability in captive-bred birds to
   cope with new environments. The acute stress response plays an important
   role in how animals cope with challenges because elevated corticosterone
   (CORT) levels can mediate learning and memory consolidation and help to
   increase their survival prospects. We experimentally tested whether
   exotic wild-caught and captive-bred cage-birds differ in their responses
   to acute stress using a representative sample of parrots. Wild-caught
   individuals showed longer CORT responses to acute stress than
   captive-bred ones, both at inter- and intra-specific levels when
   comparing wild-birds to the first generation born in captivity.
   Captive-bred birds may have attenuated their CORT responses due to
   acclimation, while high mortality rates during the international trade
   of wild-caught birds could have selected those individuals that are
   better able to cope with stress. We suggest that the longer acute
   response found in wild-caught parrots could help them to escape from
   cages and survive when facing challenges in new wild environments,
   possibly contributing to their higher invasiveness.

TI Epigenetic programming and reprogramming during development
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Cell identity is determined by specific gene expression patterns that
   are conveyed by interactions between transcription factors and DNA in
   the context of chromatin. In development, epigenetic modifiers are
   thought to stabilize gene expression and ensure that patterns of DNA
   methylation and histone modification are reinstated in cells as they
   divide. Global erasure of epigenetic marks occurs naturally at two
   stages in the mammalian life cycle, but it can also be artificially
   engineered using a variety of reprogramming strategies. Here we review
   some of the recent advances in understanding how epigenetic remodeling
   contributes to conversion of cell fate in vivo and in vitro. We
   summarize current models of epigenetic erasure and discuss the various
   enzymes and mechanisms that may operate in cellular reprogramming.

TI Interobserver Agreement for Thyroid Elastography Value of the Quality
   Factor
SO JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
AB Objectives-The purpose of our study was to investigate interobserver
   agreement for thyroid ultrasound elastography and to analyze the
   reproducibility of real-time freehand elastography in thyroid nodules.
   Methods-A prospective nonrandomized double-blind study was conducted
   between September 2008 and June 2010. Real-time elastography of 89
   thyroid nodules was performed by two radiologists, with the first
   radiologist evaluating each thyroid nodule 5 minutes before the second.
   The elastograms were obtained with the patients holding their breath and
   considered valid when the quality factor was 50 or higher. The region of
   interest was positioned to include the nodule and 0.5 cm of surrounding
   normal thyroid parenchyma but to exclude the carotids and
   esophageal-tracheal structures. The elastograms were classified on a
   scale of S different patterns.
   Results-Observers 1 and 2 coincided in 79 elastographic patterns and
   disagreed on 10 nodules (11.2%). The results between the radiologists
   had a statistically significant agreement (P<.005), with a K value of
   0.838.
   Conclusions-The introduction of a quality factor in elastographic
   software and the selection of elastograms with a quality factor of SO or
   higher confer almost perfect interobserver agreement for thyroid nodule
   elastography and make elastography a reproducible technique that could
   be used in daily clinical practice.

TI Methylation-mediated repression of microRNA 129-2 enhances oncogenic
   SOX4 expression in HCC
SO LIVER INTERNATIONAL
AB Background & Aims Aberration of miR-129-2 has been linked to a variety
   of human tumours. However, whether miR-129-2 is involved in
   hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. Here, we investigate the
   involvement of miR-129-2 in HBV infection-related HCC. Methods A total
   of 75 paired tumour and their corresponding non-tumour liver tissues
   from HCC patients with serum HBsAg positive were collected. The
   methylation of miR-129-2 gene was quantitatively analysed by a DNA
   methylation-sensitive endonuclease digestion followed by quantitative
   PCR. The expression of mature miR-129-2 (miR-129-3p) was detected by
   Taqman RT-PCR. SOX4 expression was detected using quantitative realtime
   RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining. The function of
   miR-129-2 was investigated using cell proliferation and clonogenicity
   assays in vitro. Results Compared with the adjacent non-tumour tissues,
   tumour tissues exhibited significantly increased miR-129-2
   hypermethylation both in frequency (37.33% vs. 8%, P<0.0001) and in
   intensity (14.77% vs. 3.08%, P=0.002). Accordantly, miR-129-3p
   expression in HCC tissues was significantly lower than that in
   non-tumour tissues (P=0.0461), in a manner reversely correlated with the
   level of miR-129-2 hypermethylation. Notably, SOX4 level in the HCC
   tissues was significantly higher than that in non-tumour tissues
   (P=0.0174) and normal liver tissues (P=0.0077), correlated reversely
   with miR-129-3p level (P=0.0105). Furthermore, overexpression of
   miR-129-2 in HepG2 reduced cell proliferation and clonogenicity, while
   co-expression with SOX4 could partially reverse its antitumor effects.
   In addition, SOX4 in HepG2 cell can enhance -catenin/TCF activity by
   increasing -catenin level. Conclusion The current data indicated that
   methylation-mediated repression of miR-129-2 may enhance oncogenic SOX4
   expression and involve in HCC tumorigenesis.

TI 5-Aza-dC treatment induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in 1st
   trimester trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Placental trophoblast invasion involves a cellular transition from
   epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. Cytotrophoblasts undergo epithelial
   to mesenchymal transition (EMT) when differentiating into extravillous
   trophoblasts and gaining the capacity of invasion. In this research, we
   investigated the role of DNA methylation in trophoblasts during this
   EMT. First, using BeWo and HTR8/SVneo cell lines as models of
   cytotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts, respectively, we
   analyzed the gene expression and DNA methylation status of the known
   epithelial marker genes, E-Cadherin and Cytokeratin7. We found that, in
   HTR8/SVneo cells, both genes were silenced and their promoters
   hypermethylated, as compared with the high-level gene expression and
   promoter hypomethylation observed in BeWo cells. This result suggests
   that dynamic DNA methylation of epithelial marker genes plays a critical
   role in the trophoblast EMT process. To verify these results, we treated
   HTR8/SVneo cells with 5-aza-dC, a known inhibitor of DNA
   methyltransferase, for three days. Five-Aza-dC treatment significantly
   increased the expression of epithelial marker genes and slightly
   decreased the expression of mesenchymal genes, as detected by qRT-PCR,
   immunocytochemistry and Western blot. Furthermore, 5-aza-dC treated
   HTR8/SVneo cells changed their morphology from mesenchymal into
   epithelial phenotype, indicating that 5-aza-dC induced mesenchymal to
   epithelial transition. Lastly, we examined the effect of 5-aza-dC on
   trophoblast migration and invasion capacity. We applied 5-aza-dC to
   HTR8/SVneo cells in trans-well cell migration and invasion assays and
   found that 5-aza-dC treatment decreased trophoblast migration and
   invasion capacity. In conclusion, DNA methylation of epithelial marker
   genes represents a molecular mechanism for the process of trophoblast
   EMT. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Glucocorticoid Programming of the Fetal Male Hippocampal Epigenome
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The late-gestation surge in fetal plasma cortisol is critical for
   maturation of fetal organ systems. As a result, synthetic
   glucocorticoids (sGCs) are administered to pregnant women at risk of
   delivering preterm. However, animal studies have shown that fetal
   exposure to sGC results in increased risk of behavioral, endocrine, and
   metabolic abnormalities in offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that
   prenatal GC exposure resulting from the fetal cortisol surge or after
   sGC exposure results in promoter-specific epigenetic changes in the
   hippocampus. Fetal guinea pig hippocampi were collected before
   (gestational day [GD52]) and after (GD65) the fetal plasma cortisol
   surge (Term similar to GD67) and 24 hours after (GD52) and 14 days after
   (GD65) two repeat courses of maternal sGC (betamethasone) treatment (n =
   3-4/gp). We identified extensive genome-wide alterations in promoter
   methylation in late fetal development (coincident with the fetal
   cortisol surge), whereby the majority of the affected promoters
   exhibited hypomethylation. Fetuses exposed to sGC in late gestation
   exhibited substantial differences in DNA methylation and histone h3
   lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation in specific gene promoters; 24 hours after
   the sGC treatment, the majority of genes affected were hypomethylated or
   hyperacetylated. However, 14 days after sGC exposure these differences
   did not persist, whereas other promoters became hypermethylated or
   hyperacetylated. These data support the hypothesis that the fetal GC
   surge is responsible, in part, for significant variations in genome-wide
   promoter methylation and that prenatal sGC treatment profoundly changes
   the epigenetic landscape, affecting both DNA methylation and H3K9
   acetylation. This is important given the widespread use of sGC in the
   management of women in preterm labor. (Endocrinology 154: 1168-1180,

TI The impairment of the High Mobility Group A (HMGA) protein function
   contributes to the anticancer activity of trabectedin
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Trabectedin (Ecteinascidin-743 or ET-743) is a novel antitumour agent of
   marine origin with potent antitumour activity both in vitro and in vivo.
   It interacts with the minor groove of DNA, interfering with
   transcriptional activity and DNA repair pathways. Here, we report a
   novel mechanism by which trabectedin exerts its cytotoxic effects on
   carcinoma cells. It is based on its ability to impair the function of
   the High-Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins. These proteins have a key
   role in cell transformation, and their overexpression is a common
   feature of human malignant neoplasias, representing a poor prognostic
   index often correlated to anti-cancer drug resistance. They bind the
   minor groove of DNA, alter chromatin structure and, thus, regulate the
   transcription of several genes by enhancing or suppressing the activity
   of transcription factors.
   We first report that trabectedin has a higher cytotoxic effect on
   thyroid and colon carcinoma cells expressing abundant levels of HMGAs in
   comparison with cells not expressing them. Then, we have shown that
   trabectedin treatment displaces HMGA proteins from the HMGA-responsive
   promoters, including ATM promoter, impairing their transcriptional
   activity. Finally, we report a synergism between Ionising Radiations and
   trabectedin treatment restricted to the HMGA-overexpressing cancer
   cells. This result might have important clinical implications since it
   would suggest the use of trabectedin for the treatment of neoplasias
   expressing abundant HMGA levels that are frequently associated to
   chemoresistance and poor prognosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI The Role of miR-18b in MDM2-p53 Pathway Signaling and Melanoma
   Progression
SO JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
AB Although p53 is inactivated by point mutations in many tumors, melanomas
   infrequently harbor mutations in the p53 gene. Here we investigate the
   biological role of microRNA-18b (miR-18b) in melanoma by targeting the
   MDM2-p53 pathway.
   Expression of miR-18b was examined in nevi (n 48) and melanoma (n 92)
   samples and in melanoma cell lines and normal melanocytes.
   Immunoblotting was performed to determine the expression of various
   proteins regulated by miR-18b. The effects of miR-18b overexpression in
   melanoma cell lines were investigated using assays of colony formation,
   cell viability, migration, invasion, and cell cycle and in a xenograft
   model (n 10 mice per group). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and
   methylation assays were performed to determine the mechanism of microRNA
   silencing.
   Expression of miR-18b was substantially reduced in melanoma specimens
   and cell lines by virtue of hypermethylation and was reinduced (by 1.5-
   to 5.3-fold) in melanoma cell lines after 5-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment.
   MDM2 was identified as a target of miR-18b action, and overexpression of
   miR-18b in melanoma cells was accompanied by 75% reduced MDM2 expression
   and 2.5-fold upregulation of p53, resulting in 70% suppression of
   melanoma cell colony formation. The effects of miR-18b overexpression on
   the p53 pathway and on melanoma cell growth were reversed by MDM2
   overexpression. Stable overexpression of miR-18b produced potent tumor
   suppressor activity, as evidenced by suppressed melanoma cell viability,
   induction of apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth in vivo. miR-18b
   overexpression suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasiveness and
   reversed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
   Our results demonstrate a novel role for miR-18b as a tumor suppressor
   in melanoma, identify the MDM2-p53 pathway as a target of miR-18b
   action, and suggest miR-18b overexpression as a novel strategy to
   reactivate the p53 pathway in human tumors.

TI DAXX-dependent supply of soluble (H3.3-H4) dimers to PML bodies pending
   deposition into chromatin
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Replication-independent chromatin deposition of histone variant H3.3 is
   mediated by several chaperones. We report a multistep targeting of newly
   synthesized epitope-tagged H3.3 to chromatin via PML bodies. H3.3 is
   recruited to PML bodies in a DAXX-dependent manner, a process
   facilitated by ASF1A. DAXX is required for enrichment of ATRX, but not
   ASF1A or HIRA, with PML. Nonetheless, the chaperones colocalize with
   H3.3 at PML bodies and are found in one or more complexes with PML. Both
   DAXX and PML are necessary to prevent accumulation of a soluble,
   nonincorporated pool of H3.3. H3.3 targeting to PML is enhanced with an
   (H3.3-H4)(2) tetramerization mutant of H3.3, suggesting H3.3 recruitment
   to PML as an (H3.3-H4) dimer rather than as a tetramer. Our data support
   a model of DAXX-mediated recruitment of (H3.3-H4) dimers to PML bodies,
   which may function as triage centers for H3.3 deposition into chromatin
   by distinct chaperones.

TI DISTANCE TO A ROAD IS ASSOCIATED WITH REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND
   PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS RESPONSE IN A MIGRATORY LANDBIRD
SO WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB We investigated the impacts of an unpaved road on the distribution,
   reproduction, and stress physiology of Mountain White-crowned Sparrows
   (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha) in a high-elevation subalpine
   ecosystem. We found and monitored 152 sparrow nests over 3 years and
   captured 123 sparrows over 2 years for standardized stress series
   experiments. Distance of a nest to the road was associated with
   reproductive success, and low success near the road was primarily
   because of high rates of nest desertion. The probability of a nest
   succeeding rose with increasing distance from road up to 40 m, but nests
   beyond 40 m experienced lower nest success, possibly because of
   increased predation. Nests at intermediate distance were approximately
   twice as likely to succeed (70% survival rate) as those near (36%
   survival) or far (37% survival) from the road. Stress response of male
   sparrows subjected to a standardized field stress protocol was elevated
   within 20 m of the road (38.34 +/- 5.76 ng/ml) compared to those at
   greater distances (23.89 +/- 2.01 ng/ml). Our study is the first to
   document the association between the distance to a road and blood
   corticosterone levels in any bird species. The results present strong
   evidence of impacts of a road on nest success of a migratory songbird.
   This relatively low-traffic, low-speed road clearly presents problems,
   even for a bird species not thought to be sensitive to disturbance.

TI Loss of methylation at the IFNG promoter and CNS-1 is associated with
   the development of functional IFN-gamma memory in human CD4(+) T
   lymphocytes
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Cytokine memory for IFN- production by effector/memory Th1 cells plays a
   key role in both protective and pathological immune responses. To
   understand the epigenetic mechanism determining the ontogeny of
   effector/memory Th1 cells characterized by stable effector functions, we
   identified a T-cell-specific methylation pattern at the IFNG promoter
   and CNS-1 in ex vivo effector/memory Th1 cells, and investigated
   methylation dynamics of these regions during the development of
   effector/memory Th1 cells. During Th1 differentiation, demethylation
   occurred at both the promoter and CNS-1 regions of IFNG as early as 16
   h, and this process was independent of cell proliferation and DNA
   synthesis. Using an IFN- capture assay, we found early IFN--producing
   cells from 2-day differentiating cultures acquired permissive levels of
   demethylation and developed into effector/memory Th1 cells undergoing
   progressive demethylation at the IFNG promoter and CNS-1 when induced by
   IL-12. Methylation levels of these regions in effector/memory Th1 cells
   of peripheral blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients correlated
   inversely with reduced frequencies of IFN--producers, coincident with
   recruitment of effector/memory Th1 cells to the site of inflammation.
   Thus, after termination of TCR stimulation, IL-12 signaling potentiates
   the stable functional IFN- memory in effector/memory Th1 cells
   characterized by hypomethylation at the IFNG promoter and CNS-1.

TI Long-term trend of thyroid cancer risk among Japanese atomic-bomb
   survivors: 60 years after exposure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Thyroid cancer risk following exposure to ionizing radiation in
   childhood and adolescence is a topic of public concern. To characterize
   the long-term temporal trend and age-at-exposure variation in the
   radiation-induced risk of thyroid cancer, we analyzed thyroid cancer
   incidence data for the period from 1958 through 2005 among 105,401
   members of the Life Span Study cohort of Japanese atomic-bomb survivors.
   During the follow-up period, 371 thyroid cancer cases (excluding those
   with microcarcinoma with a diameter <10 mm) were identified as a first
   primary among the eligible subjects. Using a linear dose-response model,
   the excess relative risk of thyroid cancer at 1 Gy of radiation exposure
   was estimated as 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-2.70) at age 60
   after acute exposure at age 10. The risk decreased sharply with
   increasing age-at-exposure and there was little evidence of increased
   thyroid cancer rates for those exposed after age 20. About 36% of the
   thyroid cancer cases among those exposed before age 20 were estimated to
   be attributable to radiation exposure. While the magnitude of the excess
   risk has decreased with increasing attained age or time since exposure,
   the excess thyroid cancer risk associated with childhood exposure has
   persisted for >50 years after exposure.

TI Enrichment of cis-regulatory gene expression SNPs and methylation
   quantitative trait loci among bipolar disorder susceptibility variants
SO MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB We conducted a systematic study of top susceptibility variants from a
   genome-wide association (GWA) study of bipolar disorder to gain insight
   into the functional consequences of genetic variation influencing
   disease risk. We report here the results of experiments to explore the
   effects of these susceptibility variants on DNA methylation and mRNA
   expression in human cerebellum samples. Among the top susceptibility
   variants, we identified an enrichment of cis regulatory loci on mRNA
   expression (eQTLs), and a significant excess of quantitative trait loci
   for DNA CpG methylation, hereafter referred to as methylation
   quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). Bipolar disorder susceptibility
   variants that cis regulate both cerebellar expression and methylation of
   the same gene are a very small proportion of bipolar disorder
   susceptibility variants. This finding suggests that mQTLs and eQTLs
   provide orthogonal ways of functionally annotating genetic variation
   within the context of studies of pathophysiology in brain. No lymphocyte
   mQTL enrichment was found, suggesting that mQTL enrichment was specific
   to the cerebellum, in contrast to eQTLs. Separately, we found that using
   mQTL information to restrict the number of single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms studied enhances our ability to detect a significant
   association. With this restriction a priori informed by the observed
   functional enrichment, we identified a significant association
   (rs12618769, P-bonferroni < 0.05) from two other GWA studies (TGen +
   GAIN; 2191 cases and 1434 controls) of bipolar disorder, which we
   replicated in an independent GWA study (WTCCC). Collectively, our
   findings highlight the importance of integrating functional annotation
   of genetic variants for gene expression and DNA methylation to advance
   the biological understanding of bipolar disorder. Molecular Psychiatry

TI An Animal Model of Marginal Iodine Deficiency During Development: The
   Thyroid Axis and Neurodevelopmental Outcome
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for brain development, and iodine
   is required for TH synthesis. Environmental chemicals that perturb the
   thyroid axis result in modest reductions in TH, yet there is a paucity
   of data on the extent of neurological impairments associated with
   low-level TH disruption. This study examined the dose-response
   characteristics of marginal iodine deficiency (ID) on parameters of
   thyroid function and neurodevelopment. Diets deficient in iodine were
   prepared by adding 975, 200, 125, 25, or 0 g/kg potassium iodate to the
   base casein diet to produce five nominal iodine levels ranging from
   ample (Diet 1: 1000 g iodine/kg chow, D1) to deficient (Diet 5: 25 g
   iodine/kg chow, D5). Female Long Evans rats were maintained on these
   diets beginning 7 weeks prior to breeding until the end of lactation.
   Dams were sacrificed on gestational days 16 and 20, or when pups were
   weaned on postnatal day (PN) 21. Fetal tissue was harvested from the
   dams, and pups were sacrificed on PN14 and PN21. Blood, thyroid gland,
   and brain were collected for analysis of iodine, TH, and TH precursors
   and metabolites. Serum and thyroid gland iodine and TH were reduced in
   animals receiving two diets that were most deficient in iodine. T4 was
   reduced in the fetal brain but was not altered in the neonatal brain.
   Neurobehavior, assessed by acoustic startle, water maze learning, and
   fear conditioning, was unchanged in adult offspring, but excitatory
   synaptic transmission was impaired in the dentate gyrus in animals
   receiving two diets that were most deficient in iodine. A 15% reduction
   in cortical T4 in the fetal brain was sufficient to induce permanent
   reductions in synaptic function in adults. These findings have
   implications for regulation of TH-disrupting chemicals and suggest that
   standard behavioral assays do not readily detect neurotoxicity induced
   by modest developmental TH disruption.

TI New developments in biomarkers for melanoma
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
AB Purpose of review
   Therapy of malignant melanoma recently experienced remarkable advances
   with the introduction of two treatment regimens, gene mutation-based
   therapies with signaling pathway inhibitors (kinase inhibitors) and
   treatments with immune modulators. Both strategies prolong patients'
   survival but still have specific limitations, demanding the
   identification of additional genetic and immunological biomarkers as
   predictors of treatment response and prognosis. New developments in that
   field are summarized in this review.
   Recent findings
   Activating oncogene mutations are important melanoma biomarkers. They
   predict responsiveness to kinase inhibitor therapies and have therapy
   independent prognostic relevance. Epigenetic alterations (DNA
   methylation, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNA) in melanoma are
   emerging as potentially valuable biomarkers. With the successful
   introduction of immunotherapies for melanoma, interest in immunological
   biomarkers has grown. Tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells from patients'
   peripheral blood were recently proposed to predict prognosis and
   response to immunotherapy. A superior immune profile assessment could be
   achieved by combining a detailed characterization of a tumor's immune
   cell infiltrate with its (immune) gene signature.
   Summary
   Genetic melanoma markers have already become clinically relevant. We
   expect both their role and that of immunological biomarkers to increase
   significantly in the next few years, enabling personalized therapy with
   optimal treatment selection for individual tumors.

TI Chronic Food Administration of Salvia sclarea Oil Reduces Animals'
   Anxious and Dominant Behavior
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD
AB Recent studies indicate that an oil extract from Salvia sclarea may
   provide clinical benefits in various pathological conditions. In
   comparison to extracts from other Salvia species, S. sclarea oil
   contains twice as much omega-3 fatty acids, which are involved in
   eicosanoid synthesis pathways, and has been found to contain significant
   levels of the psychoactive monoterpane linalool. In the present study,
   we examined the mood stabilizing and anxiolytic-like effects of chronic
   food administration of S. sclarea oil extract on behavioral and
   physiological parameters of mice with prominent dominant and submissive
   features in behavioral assays used to test mood stabilizing and
   antidepressant drugs. Experimental animals received oil supplemented
   food from the age of 4 weeks or from conception via their pregnant dams.
   Each age group received either S. sclarea oil-or sunflower oil-enriched
   feed. Dominant animals, whose pregnant mothers received S. sclarea
   oil-enriched feed from the date of conception, showed a significant
   reduction of dominant and anxiety-like behavior, in comparison to their
   sunflower oil-treated counterparts. S. sclarea oil-treated submissive
   animals exhibited a similar tendency, and showed a significant reduction
   in blood corticosterone levels. These findings enforce the hypothesis
   that S. sclarea oil possesses anxiolytic properties.

TI Genetic and epigenetic alterations of WWOX in the development of gastric
   cardia adenocarcinoma
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS
AB WWOX is a tumor suppressor gene that maps to the common fragile site
   FRA16D and is involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression in many
   different carcinomas. Reduced WWOX expression is associated with more
   aggressive phenotypes and poor patient outcomes in several cancers. The
   present study was conducted in order to elucidate more precisely the
   genetic and epigenetic alterations of WWOX that play a role in gastric
   cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) carcinogenesis in a population from Northern
   China. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), PCR-simple sequence length polymorphism
   (PCR-SSLP), and methylation specific PCR (MSP) methods were used to
   characterize polymorphisms in the rs3764340, rs2548861, and rs1079635
   loci, the level of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and methylation status
   of WWOX, respectively. Protein and mRNA expression of WWOX in GCA
   tissues was quantified by immunohistochemistry and reverse
   transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Family history of upper gastrointestinal
   cancer (UGIC) significantly increased the risk of developing GCA. The
   CG+GG genotype of rs3764340 and GT or TT genotype of rs2548861
   significantly elevated the risk of developing GCA. LOH at the WWOX locus
   was observed in 45.6% tumors. The promoter and exon 1 methylation
   frequency of WWOX in GCA tissues was significantly higher than in
   corresponding normal tissues and was associated with UGIC family
   history. Protein and mRNA expression of WWOX was reduced in GCA tumor
   tissues and was associated with LOH and methylation of the gene. These
   results indicate that WWOX may play an important role in GCA especially
   in individuals with UGIC family history. Environ. Mol. Mutagen., 2013.

TI Spatial spectral imaging as an adjunct to the Bethesda classification of
   thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens
SO CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, the
   preoperative diagnostic standard of care for patients with thyroid
   nodules, has limitations. Spectral imaging captures visible light
   information that is beyond the capability of the human eye, potentially
   increasing the accuracy of FNA biopsy. In the current study, the authors
   demonstrated the feasibility of using spectral imaging in combination
   with automated spatial analysis based on trainable pattern recognition
   as an adjunct test for thyroid FNA classification by developing an
   algorithm that distinguishes between images of papillary thyroid
   carcinoma (PTC) and benign goiter (BG). METHODS: A multispectral camera
   was used to capture spectral images representing 100 cases of PTC and
   BG. Used in conjunction with commercial software, 10 cases were used as
   a training set to develop a classifier, a classification algorithm that
   segments digitized multispectral images into regions of PTC, BG, and
   nonfeature. This algorithm was used to generate a screening test and a
   diagnostic test that were validated on an independent set of images
   representing 30 cases of PTC and 30 cases of BG. RESULTS: The area under
   the receiver operating characteristic for the PTC/BG classifier was
   0.90. The screening test had a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of
   0.73. The diagnostic test had a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of
   0.90. CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed image classification tests that
   distinguish between FNAs of PTC and BG, demonstrating the potential
   value of spatial spectral imaging as an adjunct test for the
   classification of thyroid FNA samples. The data support prospective
   testing to determine the value of the PTC/BG classifier in routine
   clinical use. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2013. (c) 2012 American Cancer

TI Chromatin states at ribosomal DNA loci
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Eukaryotic transcription of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) by RNA polymerase I
   can account for more than half of the total cellular transcripts
   depending on organism and growth condition. To support this level of
   expression, eukaryotic rRNA genes are present in multiple copies.
   Interestingly, these genes co-exist in different chromatin states that
   may differ significantly in their nucleosome content and generally
   correlate well with transcriptional activity. Here we review how these
   chromatin states have been discovered and characterized focusing
   particularly on their structural protein components. The establishment
   and maintenance of rRNA gene chromatin states and their impact on rRNA
   synthesis are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue
   entitled: Transcription by Odd Pols. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Chronic exposure to stress predisposes to higher autoimmune
   susceptibility in C57BL/6 mice: Glucocorticoids as a double-edged sword
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis to
   promote the release of corticosterone (CORT), which consequently
   suppresses pathogenic stimulation of the immune system. Paradoxically,
   however, stress often promotes autoimmunity through yet unknown
   mechanisms. Here we investigated how chronic variable stress (CVS), and
   the associated alterations in CORT levels, affect the susceptibility to
   experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in female and male
   C57BL/6 mice. Under baseline (nonstressed) conditions, females exhibited
   substantially higher CORT levels and an attenuated EAE with less
   mortality than males. However, CVS induced a significantly worsened EAE
   in females, which was prevented if CORT signaling was blocked. In
   addition, females under CVS conditions showed a shift toward
   proinflammatory Th1/Th17 versus Th2 responses and a decreased proportion
   of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. This demonstrates that whereas C57BL/6 female
   mice generally exhibit higher CORT levels and an attenuated form of EAE
   than males, they become less responsive to the immunosuppressive effects
   of CORT under chronic stress and thereby prone to a higher risk of
   destructive autoimmunity.

TI Arginine methylation regulates antibody responses through modulating
   cell division and isotype switching in B cells
SO MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
AB Protein arginine methylation plays crucial roles, including signal
   transduction, transcriptional control, cell proliferation and/or
   differentiation. B cells undergo clonal division, isotype switching and
   differentiate into antibody forming cells following stimulation with
   Toll-like receptor-ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and T cell-derived
   signals, including CD40-ligand (CD40-L) and interleukin 4 (IL-4).
   Whether protein arginine methylation affects B cell division and/or
   isotype switching to IgG1 in response to LPS, IL-4, and CD40-L was
   examined using the arginine methyl transferase inhibitor
   adenosine-2,3-dialdehyde (AdOx). Addition of AdOx substantially reduced
   the number of division cycles of stimulated B cells, whereas cell
   viability remained intact. Upon stimulation with LPS/IL-4/CD40-L, the
   proportion of surface IgG1 positive cells in each division cycle was
   slightly diminished by AdOx. However, the degree of expression of 1 germ
   line transcript and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in
   response to LPS/IL-4/CD40-L were unaffected by addition of AdOx,
   suggesting that AdOx influences class switch recombination independent
   of AID expression through transcriptional control. Taken together,
   arginine methylation appears to be involved in B cell isotype switching,
   as well as in clonal expansion of B cells in response to
   LPS/IL-4/CD40-L.

TI Epigenetic analysis of the Notch superfamily in high-grade serous
   ovarian cancer
SO GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
AB Objectives. Gene methylation and other epigenetic modifications of gene
   regulation have been implicated in the growth of ovarian cancer, but the
   clinical significance of such modifications in the Notch pathway in
   high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) is not well understood. We
   used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to study the clinical relevance
   of epigenetic modifications of Notch superfamily genes.
   Methods. We analyzed the interaction of DNA methylation and miRNAs with
   gene expression data for Notch superfamily members with the Spearman
   rank correlation test and explored potential relationships with overall
   survival (OS) with the log-rank test. We downloaded clinical data, level
   3 gene expression data, and level 3 DNA methylation data for 480
   patients with stage II-IV HGS-OvCa from the TCGA data portal. Patients
   were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts for survival
   analyses. In each set, patients were grouped into percentiles according
   to methylation and microRNA (miRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. We
   used several algorithms to predict miRNA-mRNA interaction.
   Results. There were significant inverse relationships between
   methylation status and mRNA expression for PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1. For
   each of these genes, patients with a lower methylation level and higher
   expression level had significantly poorer OS than did patients with a
   higher methylation level and lower expression level. We also found a
   significant inverse relationship between miRNAs and mRNA expression for
   CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1. By further analyzing the effect of miRNAs on
   gene expression and OS, we found that patients with higher levels of
   CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1 expression and lower expression levels of their
   respective miRNAs (502-5p, 128, and 215/625) had significantly poorer
   OS.
   Conclusions. Epigenetic alterations of multiple Notch target genes and
   pathway interacting genes (PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1) may relate to
   activation of this pathway and poor survival of patients with HGS-OvCa.

TI Discovery of a chemical probe for the L3MBTL3 methyllysine reader domain
SO NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB We describe the discovery of UNC1215, a potent and selective chemical
   probe for the methyllysine (Kme) reading function of L3MBTL3, a member
   of the malignant brain tumor (MBT) family of chromatin-interacting
   transcriptional repressors. UNC1215 binds L3MBTL3 with a K(d) of 120 nM,
   competitively displacing mono- or dimethyllysine-containing peptides,
   and is greater than 50-fold more potent toward L3MBTL3 than other
   members of the MBT family while also demonstrating selectivity against
   more than 200 other reader domains examined. X-ray crystallography
   identified a unique 2:2 polyvalent mode of interaction between UNC1215
   and L3MBTL3. In cells, UNC1215 is nontoxic and directly binds L3MBTL3
   via the Kme-binding pocket of the MBT domains. UNC1215 increases the
   cellular mobility of GFP-L3MBTL3 fusion proteins, and point mutants that
   disrupt the Kme-binding function of GFP-L3MBTL3 phenocopy the effects of
   UNC1215 on localization. Finally, UNC1215 was used to reveal a new
   Kme-dependent interaction of L3MBTL3 with BCLAF1, a protein implicated
   in DNA damage repair and apoptosis.

TI The Role of Chromatin Remodeling in Medulloblastoma
SO BRAIN PATHOLOGY
AB The unexpectedly high frequency and universality of alterations to the
   chromatin machinery is one of the most striking themes emerging from the
   current deluge of cancer genomics data. Medulloblastoma (MB), a
   malignant pediatric brain tumor, is no exception to this trend, with a
   wealth of recent studies indicating multiple alterations at all levels
   of chromatin processing. MB is typically now regarded as being composed
   of four major molecular entities (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4), which
   vary in their clinical and biological characteristics. Similarities and
   differences across these subgroups are also reflected in the specific
   chromatin modifiers that are found to be altered in each group, and each
   new cancer genome sequence or microarray profile is adding to this
   important knowledge base. These data are fundamentally changing our
   understanding of tumor developmental pathways, not just for MB but also
   for cancer as a whole. They also provide a new class of targets for the
   development of rational, personalized therapeutic approaches. The
   mechanisms by which these chromatin remodelers are dysregulated in MB,
   and the consequences both for future basic research and for translation
   to the clinic, will be examined here.

TI Laryngeal tumor volume as a predictor for thyroid cartilage penetration
SO HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND
   NECK
AB Background. Review of laryngectomy specimens demonstrated that
   preoperative CT scanning is suboptimal in predicting both thyroid
   cartilage penetration and extralaryngeal spread. We investigated the
   association between the CT-based gross tumor volume (GTV) with
   pathologic evidence of thyroid cartilage penetration among patients
   undergoing laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx.
   Methods. Ninety-four patients were identified who underwent total
   laryngectomy for SCC of the larynx. GTV, as defined by preoperative
   diagnostic CT scan, was contoured and analyzed using treatment-planning
   software.
   Results. Among the 49 nonirradiated patients, the mean GTVs of patients
   with (n = 15) and without (n = 34) thyroid cartilage penetration was
   60.1 and 28.0 cm(3) (p = .004). When the nonirradiated patients were
   divided into 3 GTV groups (<= 25 cm(3), 25-50 cm(3), >50 cm(3)), the
   rates of thyroid cartilage penetration were 23%, 17%, and 78%,
   respectively (p = .003).
   Conclusions. Laryngeal tumor volume is associated with pathologic
   evidence of thyroid cartilage penetration in nonirradiated patients. (C)

TI Comprehensive DNA methylation and extensive mutation analyses reveal an
   association between the CpG island methylator phenotype and oncogenic
   mutations in gastric cancers
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB Recent development of personal sequencers for extensive mutation
   analysis and bead array technology for comprehensive DNA methylation
   analysis have made it possible to obtain integrated pictures of genetic
   and epigenetic alterations on the same set of cancer samples. Here, we
   aimed to establish such pictures of gastric cancers (GCs). Comprehensive
   methylation analysis of 30 GCs revealed that the number of aberrantly
   methylated genes was highly variable among individual GCs. Extensive
   mutation analysis of 55 known cancer-related genes revealed that 19 of
   the 30 GCs had 24 somatic mutations of eight different genes (CDH1,
   CTNNB1, ERBB2, KRAS, MLH1, PIK3CA, SMARCB1, and TP53). Integration of
   information on the genetic and epigenetic alterations revealed that the
   GCs with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) tended to have
   mutations of oncogenes, CTNNB1, ERBB2, KRAS, and PIK3CA. This is one of
   the first studies in which both genetic and epigenetic alterations were
   extensively analyzed in the same set of samples. It was also
   demonstrated for the first time in GCs that the CIMP was associated with
   oncogene mutations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Short-term severe thyroid hormone deficiency does not influence sleep
   parameters
SO SLEEP AND BREATHING
AB The influence of short-term severe thyroid hormone deficiency on sleep
   is currently still unknown. Several studies have demonstrated an effect
   of long-term hypothyroidism on sleep disorders due to anatomical changes
   of the pharynx or body mass. The aim of this preliminary study, however,
   is to evaluate the changes in sleep patterns of patients with short-term
   hypothyroidism to elucidate the isolated effect of thyroid hormone
   withdrawal before anatomical changes can potentially occur.
   Ten patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were enrolled in this
   study. Two patients discontinued the study and one patient was finally
   excluded due to obesity, so that the datasets of seven patients were
   available for study analysis. During the course of carcinoma treatment,
   each patient had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and I-131
   remnant ablation. Polysomnographic measurements were performed twice:
   (1) over the course of two consecutive nights during severe thyroid
   hormone deficiency after levothyroxine withdrawal and prior to further
   diagnostics and therapy and (2) during euthyroidism after substitution
   with levothyroxine.
   Comparison of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale during hypo- and euthyroidism
   for each patient revealed no statistically significant difference.
   Furthermore, the comparison of polysomnographic parameters like (1)
   apnea-hypopnea index, (2) the duration of various sleep stages, (3)
   duration of rapid eye movement sleep, (4) latency until rapid eye
   movement sleep, (5) total sleep time, (6) periodic leg movements, and
   (7) arousal index showed no statistically significant differences
   between the hypothyroid or euthyroid state.
   We conclude that, in this preliminary experimental setting, short-term
   severe thyroid hormone deficiency per se does not cause sleep
   disturbances and a feeling of fatigue as described in other studies may
   be due to changes in perception or brain metabolism during
   hypothyroidism.

TI Epigenetic modification of fetal fibroblasts improves developmental
   competency and gene expression in porcine cloned embryos
SO VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Treatment of somatic cells with DNA methylation and histone
   deacetylation inhibitors has been hypothesized to improve the potential
   reprogramming after nuclear transfer (NT). The objective of this study
   was to investigate the developmental competence and gene expression
   during the porcine preimplantation development of in vitro fertilized
   (IVF) and embryos cloned with porcine fetal fibroblasts (pFF) (pFF-NT),
   and pFF treated by 0.5 mu M 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) (pFF+5-azaC-NT) or
   1.0 mM sodium butyrate (NaB) (pFF+NaB-NT). IVF embryos had significantly
   (P < 0.05) higher blastocyst rates (27.7 +/- 2.6 %) and total cell
   numbers (46.7 +/- 3.9). However, NT embryos from pFF+5-azaC and pFF+NaB
   showed enhanced developmental potential with significantly (P < 0.05)
   higher rates of blastocysts (21.3 +/- 2.9 % and 22.4 +/- 1.7 %,
   respectively) than those from pFF (15.1 +/- 2.5 %). Further, NT embryos
   from pFF+5-azaC and pFF+NaB (33.8 +/- 4.1 and 35.7 +/- 5.2,
   respectively) had significantly (P < 0.05) higher total cell numbers
   than those from pFF (24.6 +/- 3.5). Differential expression pattern of
   genes involved in DNA methylation (DNA methyltransferases- DNMT1, DNMT2,
   DNMT3A and DNMT3B), histone acetylation (histone acetyltransferase 1-
   HAT1) and histone deacetylation (histone deacetylases- HDAC1, HDAC2 and
   HDAC3) were observed in NT embryos when compared to IVF counterparts.
   However, the relative expressions of genes in pFF+5-azaC-NT and
   pFF+NaB-NT groups were largely comparable to those of IVF embryos than
   pFF-NT embryos. In conclusion, modification of the epigenetic status by
   reducing DNA methylation or enhancing histone acetylation levels in pFF
   improved the developmental rates, total cell number and the
   transcription profile of porcine NT embryos. Thus, somatic cells with
   relatively hypomethylated or hyperacetylated genome may enhance
   reprogramming efficiency in porcine NT.

TI SNF5 Reexpression in Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors Regulates Transcription
   of Target Genes by Recruitment of SWI/SNF Complexes and RNAPII to the
   Transcription Start Site of Their Promoters
SO MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH
AB Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), a highly aggressive cancer of young
   children, displays inactivation or loss of the hSNF5/INI1/SMARCB1 gene,
   a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, in primary
   tumors and cell lines. We have previously reported that reexpression of
   hSNF5 in some MRT cell lines causes a G(1) arrest via p21(CIP1/WAF1)
   (p21) mRNA induction in a p53-independent manner. However, the
   mechanism(s) by which hSNF5 reexpression activates gene transcription
   remains unclear. We initially searched for other hSNF5 target genes by
   asking whether hSNF5 loss altered regulation of other consensus p53
   target genes. Our studies show that hSNF5 regulates only a subset of p53
   target genes, including p21 and NOXA, in MRT cell lines. We also show
   that hSNF5 reexpression modulates SWI/SNF complex levels at the
   transcription start site (TSS) at both loci and leads to activation of
   transcription initiation through recruitment of RNA polymerase II
   (RNAPII) accompanied by H3K4 and H3K36 modifications. Furthermore, our
   results show lower NOXA expression in MRT cell lines compared with other
   human tumor cell lines, suggesting that hSNF5 loss may alter the
   expression of this important apoptotic gene. Thus, one mechanism for MRT
   development after hSNF5 loss may rely on reduced chromatin-remodeling
   activity of the SWI/SNF complex at the TSS of critical gene promoters.
   Furthermore, because we observe growth inhibition after NOXA expression
   in MRT cells, the NOXA pathway may provide a novel target with clinical
   relevancy for treatment of this aggressive disease. Mol Cancer Res;

   P were enhanced 7.5-, 26.7-, 600-, 116.7-, 500-, 75-, 3000-, and
   4500-fold, respectively. Global qualitative and quantitative analysis of
   not only the high-abundance species but also the low-abundance species
   in the polar lipids was achieved. When the method was applied to mouse

   localization when the nuclear membrane undergoes periodic reconstruction
   in the cell cycle during preimplantation embryo development.
   The fluorescence intensity was examined via immunofluorescence. The mRNA
   expression of G9awas determined using real-time reverse transcriptase
   (RT)-PCR. Eight-cell embryos were cultured in KSOM supplemented with
   nocodazole (0.5 mu M) for 12 h.
   In this study, it was observed that the fluorescence intensity of H3K9m2
   and G9a began to increase significantly from the 4-cell stage and
   reached the peak at the morula stage (p < 0.001), but the fluorescence
   intensity declined to 4-cell-stage levels when it reached the blastula
   stage. We observed a similar pattern when we examined G9a mRNA
   expression. Once the nuclear membrane disintegrated, G9a and H3K9m1 were
   not detectable by immunofluorescence; when it was reconstructed, G9a and
   H3K9m1 had relocated to the cell nucleus. However, no significant change
   was observed in the H3K9m2 localization or in the G9a mRNA level (p >
   0.05) during the whole process. JHDM2A was consistently localized in the
   cytoplasm irrespective of the presence or absence of a nuclear membrane.
   These results indicate dynamic changes in the expression level of H3K9m2
   and G9a as preimplantation embryogenesis progresses. G9a co-localized
   with H3K9 m1 in a nuclear membrane-dependent manner during mouse
   preimplantation embryo development.

TI Covariation among glucocorticoid regulatory elements varies seasonally
   in house sparrows
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) help individuals cope with changes throughout
   life; one such change is the seasonal transition through life-history
   stages. Previous research shows that many animals exhibit seasonal
   variation in baseline GCs and GC responses to stressors, but the effects
   of season on other aspects of GC regulation have been less studied.
   Moreover, whether elements of GC regulation covary within individuals
   and whether covariation changes seasonally has been not been
   investigated. Evolutionarily, strong linkages among GC regulatory
   elements is predicted to enhance system efficiency and regulation,
   however may reduce the plasticity necessary to ensure appropriate
   responses under varying conditions. Here, we measured corticosterone
   (CURT), the major avian GC, at baseline, after exposure to a restraint
   stressor, and in response to dexamethasone (to assess negative feedback
   capacity) in wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) during the breeding
   and molting seasons. We also measured hippocampal mRNA expression of the
   two receptors primarily responsible for CURT regulation: the
   mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR,
   respectively). Consistent with previous studies, restraint-induced CORT
   was lower during molt than breeding, but negative-feedback was not
   influenced by season. Receptor gene expression was affected by season,
   however, as during breeding, the ratio of MR to GR expression was
   significantly lower than during molt. Furthermore, MR expression was
   negatively correlated with CURT released in response to a stressor, but
   only during molt. We found that individuals that most strongly
   up-regulated CURT in response to restraint were also most effective at
   reducing CURT via negative feedback; although these relationships were
   independent of season, they were stronger during molt. (C) 2013 Elsevier

TI Bridging the transgenerational gap with epigenetic memory
SO TRENDS IN GENETICS
AB It is textbook knowledge that inheritance of traits is governed by
   genetics, and that the epigenetic modifications an organism acquires are
   largely reset between generations. Recently, however, transgenerational
   epigenetic inheritance has emerged as a rapidly growing field, providing
   evidence suggesting that some epigenetic changes result in persistent
   phenotypes across generations. Here, we survey some of the most recent
   examples of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in animals, ranging
   from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, and describe approaches and
   limitations to studying this phenomenon. We also review the current body
   of evidence implicating chromatin modifications and RNA molecules in
   mechanisms underlying this unconventional mode of inheritance and
   discuss its evolutionary implications.

TI Long-Term Cisplatin Exposure Promotes Methylation of the OCT1 Gene in
   Human Esophageal Cancer Cells
SO DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES
AB Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is widely used for treatment of a variety
   of human malignant solid and metastatic tumors, including esophageal
   cancer. However, the clinical effect of this drug is limited because of
   intrinsic and acquired resistance to it. Organic cation transporters
   (OCTs) are important in the cellular uptake of cisplatin.
   Our objective was to test the hypothesis that cisplatin resistance is
   associated with alteration of expression of OCTs.
   Levels of expression of OCTs in paired esophageal cancer and adjacent
   non-cancerous tissues were examined by use of immunohistochemistry.
   We found that OCT1 silencing impaired cisplatin-mediated apoptosis of
   esophageal cancer cells. The level of OCT1 mRNA in cisplatin-resistant
   cells was markedly reduced compared with parental cells. Promoter
   methylation of OCT1 was induced in cisplatin-resistant cells.
   This study shows that long-term exposure to cisplatin promotes
   methylation of the OCT1 gene in human esophageal cancer cells, which in
   turn results in cisplatin resistance.

TI DNA Copy Number Variations Characterize Benign and Malignant Thyroid
   Tumors
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the best diagnostic tool for
   preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules but is often inconclusive as
   a guide for surgical management.
   Objective: Our hypothesis was that thyroid tumor subtypes may show
   characteristic DNA copy number variation (CNV) patterns, which may
   further improve the preoperative classification.
   Design: Our study cohorts included benign follicular adenomas (FAs),
   classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and follicular variant PTCs
   (FVPTCs), the three subtypes most commonly associated with inconclusive
   preoperative cytopathology.
   Setting: Tissue and FNA samples were obtained at an academic tertiary
   referral center.
   Patients: Cases were identified that underwent partial or complete
   thyroidectomy for malignant or indeterminate thyroid lesions between
   2000 and 2008 and had adequate snap-frozen tissue.
   Interventions: Pairs of tumor tissue and matching normal thyroid
   tissue-derived DNA were compared using 550K single-nucleotide
   polymorphism arrays.
   Main Outcome Measure: Statistically significant differences in CNV
   patterns between tumor subtypes were identified.
   Results: Segmental amplifications in chromosomes (Ch) 7 and 12 were more
   common in FAs than in PTCs or FVPTCs. Additionally, a subset of FAs and
   FVPTCs showed deletions in Ch22. We identified the 5 CNV-associated
   genes best at discriminating between FAs and PTCs/FVPTCs, which
   correctly classified 90% of cases. These 5 Ch12 genes were validated by
   quantitative genomic PCR and gene expression array analyses on the same
   patient cohort. The 5-gene signature was then successfully validated
   against an independent test cohort of benign and malignant tumor
   samples. Finally, we performed a feasibility study on matched FA-derived
   intraoperative FNA samples and were able to correctly identify FAs
   harboring the Ch12 amplification signature, whereas FAs without
   amplification showed a normal Ch12 signature.
   Conclusions: Thyroid tumor subtypes possess characteristic genomic
   profiles that may further our understanding of structural genetic
   changes in thyroid tumor subtypes and may lead to the development of new
   diagnostic biomarkers in FNA samples. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98:

TI Epigenetic control of female puberty
SO NATURE NEUROSCIENCE
AB The timing of puberty is controlled by many genes. The elements
   coordinating this process have not, however, been identified. Here we
   show that an epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional repression times
   the initiation of female puberty in rats. We identify silencers of the
   Polycomb group (PcG) as principal contributors to this mechanism and
   show that PcG proteins repress Kiss1, a puberty-activating gene.
   Hypothalamic expression of two key PcG genes, Eed and Cbx7, decreased
   and methylation of their promoters increased before puberty. Inhibiting
   DNA methylation blocked both events and resulted in pubertal failure.
   The pubertal increase in Kiss1 expression was accompanied by EED loss
   from the Kiss1 promoter and enrichment of histone H3 modifications
   associated with gene activation. Preventing the eviction of EED from the
   Kiss1 promoter disrupted pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone
   release, delayed puberty and compromised fecundity. Our results identify
   epigenetic silencing as a mechanism underlying the neuroendocrine
   control of female puberty.

TI Hypercalcitoninemia in thyroid conditions other than medullary thyroid
   carcinoma: a comparative analysis of calcium and pentagastrin
   stimulation of serum calcitonin
SO LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
AB Calcitonin screening aims at uncovering occult medullary thyroid cancer
   (MTC) in patients with nodular thyroid disease. Elevated basal
   calcitonin serum levels call for calcitonin stimulation, the level of
   which may direct the extent of surgery. Because pentagastrin has become
   restricted, calcium has increasingly been used instead for stimulation.
   This study identified a new spectrum of patients demonstrating a
   false-positive hypercalcitoninemia in the absence of C-cell disease,
   carrying multinodular goiter (MNG), thyroiditis, and non-MTC thyroid
   malignancy, and endeavored to explore the feasibility of extrapolating
   pentagastrin-stimulated to calcium-stimulated calcitonin thresholds.
   Altogether, 43 (9.5 %) of 455 patients with nodular thyroid disease
   revealed increased basal calcitonin serum levels between 2005 and 2012,
   for which they underwent intravenous stimulation with pentagastrin (31
   patients) or calcium gluconate (12 patients) before and after primary
   thyroidectomy.
   Stimulation with calcium gluconate resulted in significantly higher and
   more variable preoperative calcitonin serum levels after 2 (241.2 vs.
   104.9 pg/mL; P = 0.018) and 5 min (240.6 vs. 87.4 pg/mL; P = 0.007) than
   stimulation with pentagastrin. Stimulation with calcium gluconate
   produced 10-fold (nodular goiter), 15-fold (thyroiditis), and 21-fold
   (thyroid neoplasia other than MTC) calcitonin increases over baseline,
   as opposed to 5-fold, 10-fold, and 8-fold increases after stimulation
   with pentagastrin. None of the 43 patients, all of whom reverted to
   undetectable calcitonin serum levels after thyroidectomy, had
   immunohistochemical evidence of C-cell disease. Subgroup analyses
   according to gender and thyroid disease, being limited by the low number
   of patients in each subgroup, did not yield significant differences.
   Calcium stimulation yields significantly greater calcitonin levels than
   pentagastrin stimulation, precluding generalization of
   pentagastrin-stimulated to calcium-stimulated calcitonin thresholds.
   After calcium stimulation, false-positive findings appear to be more
   common in patients of female gender and patients with thyroiditis and
   thyroid neoplasia other than MTC, potentially effecting surgical
   overtreatment.

TI Glucocorticoids in the dorsomedial striatum modulate the consolidation
   of spatial but not procedural memory
SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY
AB Glucocorticoid hormones are known to influence widely interconnected
   brain networks, thereby enhancing the consolidation of memory of several
   types of training experiences. In this network, the dorsal striatum
   plays an important role in transforming goal-directed behavior into
   habitual behavior. Many studies have shown that the dorsolateral
   striatum (DLS) enables the formation of stimulus-response associations
   that are needed for procedural learning. In contrast, the dorsomedial
   striatum (DMS) is predominantly involved in influencing goal-directed
   behaviors via interactions with the dorsal hippocampus and medial
   prefrontal cortex. To date, most studies that have supported a
   functional dissociation of the dorsal striatum in memory have focused on
   the behavioral deficits produced by lesions or temporary inactivation of
   different striatal regions. Few studies have investigated the effect of
   pharmacological activation of the DMS in modulating memory of distinct
   kinds of spatial navigation. Therefore, in the present study
   corticosterone (CORT) was administered into the DMS immediately after
   training on either a place or cue water-maze task to investigate
   possible effects on the consolidation of spatial and procedural memory.
   Our findings indicate that CORT (5, 10 and 20 ng) enhanced 24-h
   retention of place training, without affecting retention of cue
   training. However, CORT administration after place and cue training did
   not shift the selection from a procedural to a spatial navigation
   strategy in a place-cue competition test. These findings support the
   functional heterogeneity of the dorsal striatum and suggest that the DMS
   can modulate the consolidation of allocentric spatial information via
   glucocorticoid action. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Granulocyte maturation determines ability to release chromatin NETs and
   loss of DNA damage response; these properties are absent in immature AML
   granulocytes
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH
AB Terminally-differentiated cells cease to proliferate and acquire
   specific sets of expressed genes and functions distinguishing them from
   less differentiated and cancer cells. Mature granulocytes show lobular
   structure of cell nuclei with highly condensed chromatin in which HP1
   proteins are replaced by MNEI. These structural features of chromatin
   correspond to low level of gene expression and the loss of some
   important functions as DNA damage repair, shown in this work and, on the
   other hand, acquisition of a new specific function consisting in the
   release of chromatin extracellular traps in response to infection by
   pathogenic microbes. Granulocytic differentiation is incomplete in
   myeloid leukemia and is manifested by persistence of lower levels of HP1
   gamma and HP1 beta isoforms. This immaturity is accompanied by
   acquisition of DDR capacity allowing to these incompletely
   differentiated multi-lobed neutrophils of AML patients to respond to
   induction of DSB by gamma-irradiation. Immature granulocytes persist
   frequently in blood of treated AML patients in remission. These
   granulocytes contrary to mature ones do not release chromatin for NETs
   after activation with phorbol myristate-12 acetate-13 and do not exert
   the neutrophil function in immune defence. We suggest therefore the
   detection of HP1 expression in granulocytes of AML patients as a very
   sensitive indicator of their maturation and functionality after the
   treatment. Our results show that the changes in chromatin structure
   underlie a major transition in functioning of the genome in immature
   granulocytes. They show further that leukemia stem cells can
   differentiate ex vivo to mature granulocytes despite carrying the
   translocation BCR/ABL. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Migratory Capacity of Human Trophoblastic BeWo Cells: Effects of
   Aldosterone and the Epithelial Sodium Channel
SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE BIOLOGY
AB Aldosterone is a key regulator of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)
   and stimulates protein methylation on the beta-subunit of the ENaC. We
   found that aldosterone (100 nM) promotes cellular migration in a
   wound-healing model in trophoblastic BeWo cells. Here, we tested if the
   positive influence of aldosterone on wound healing is related to
   methylation reactions. Cell migration and proliferation were measured in
   BeWo cells at 6 h, when mitosis is still scarce. Cell migration covered
   12.4, 25.3, 19.6 and 45.1 % of the wound when cultivated under control,
   aldosterone (12 h), 8Br-cAMP and aldosterone plus 8Br-cAMP,
   respectively. Amiloride blocked the effects of aldosterone alone or in
   the presence of 8Br-cAMP on wound healing. Wound healing decreased in
   aldosterone (plus 8Br-cAMP) coexposed with the methylation inhibitor
   3-deaza-adenosine (3-DZA, 12.9 % reinvasion of the wound). There was an
   increase in wound healing in aldosterone-, 8Br-cAMP- and 3-DZA-treated
   cells in the presence of AdoMet, a methyl donor, compared to cells in
   the absence of AdoMet (27.3 and 12.9 % reinvasion of the wound,
   respectively). Cell proliferation assessed with the reagent MTT was not
   changed in any of these treatments, suggesting that cellular migration
   is the main factor for reinvasion of wound healing. Electrophysiological
   studies showed an increase in ENaC current in the presence of
   aldosterone. This effect was higher with 8Br-cAMP, and there was a
   decrease when 3-DZA was present. AdoMet treatment partially reversed
   this phenomenon. We suggest that aldosterone positively influences wound
   healing in BeWo cells, at least in part through methylation of the ENaC.

TI Epigenetic silencing of Id4 identifies a glioblastoma subgroup with a
   better prognosis as a consequence of an inhibition of angiogenesis
SO CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of DNA binding/differentiation (Id1 to Id4) are a
   family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors, which are highly
   expressed during embryogenesis and at lower levels in mature tissues.
   Id4 plays an important role in neuronal stem cell differentiation, and
   its deregulation has been implicated in glial neoplasia. METHODS: The
   methylation status of Id4 was analyzed by methylation-specific
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 62 glioblastoma (GBM) cases and in 20
   normal brain tissues. Methylation status of Id4 was confirmed by
   sequencing after subcloning and messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein
   expression. We also evaluated the mRNA expression of MGP (matrix GLA
   protein), TGF-1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), and VEGF (vascular
   endothelial growth factor) by real-time PCR analysis. Clinical and
   histological assessment of tumor angiogenesis was performed by
   evaluating the relative enhancing tumor ratio on magnetic resonance
   imaging and microvessel density on von Willebrand factorstained
   sections, respectively. RESULTS: The promoter of Id4 was methylated in
   23 of 62 (37%) GBMs. In methylated GBMs, Id4 mRNA was significantly
   reduced, compared with unmethylated GBMs (P = .0002). A significant
   reduction of protein expression was detected in all hypermethylated
   cases. GBMs with methylated Id4 showed a significant reduction of MGP,
   TGF-1, and VEGF mRNA expression and had significantly lower relative
   enhancing tumor ratio (P = .0108) and microvessel density (P = .0241)
   values with respect to unmethylated GBMs. Finally, Id4 methylation was
   significantly associated with a favorable clinical outcome (P = .0006).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that methylation of Id4 may be involved
   in the pathogenesis of GBM and in the resistance of this neoplasm to
   conventional treatment throughout MGP-mediated neoangiogenesis. Cancer

TI Thyroid hormone concentrations differ between donkeys and horses
SO EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL
AB Reasons for performing study: Reference intervals for thyroid hormones
   (TH) concentrations have not been previously established for donkeys,
   leading to potential misdiagnosis of thyroid disease. Objectives: To
   determine the normal values of TH in healthy adult donkeys and compare
   them to TH values from healthy adult horses. Methods: Thirty-eight
   healthy Andalusian donkeys and 19 healthy Andalusian horses from 2
   different farms were used. Donkeys were divided into 3 age groups: <5,
   510 and >11 years and into 2 gender groups. Serum concentrations of fT3,
   tT3, rT3, fT4 and tT4 were quantified by radioimmunoassay. All blood
   samples were collected the same day in the morning. None of the animals
   had received any treatment for 30 days prior to sampling or had any
   history of disease. Both farms were in close proximity and under similar
   management. Differences between groups were determined using a one-way
   ANOVA analysis followed by Fisher's LSD test. P<0.05 was considered
   significant. Results: Serum TH concentrations were higher in donkeys
   than in horses (P<0.01). Donkeys <5 years had higher serum rT3, fT4 and
   tT4 concentrations than donkeys >5 years (P<0.05). Furthermore, older
   donkeys (>11 years) had lower serum fT3 and tT3 concentrations than
   younger donkeys' groups (<5 and 510 years, P<0.05). TH concentrations
   were not different between genders (fT3: P = 0.06; tT3: P = 0.08; rT3: P
   = 0.15; fT4: P = 0.89; and tT4: P = 0.19). Conclusions: Thyroid hormone
   concentrations are different between healthy adult donkeys and horses.
   Potential relevance: Establishing species-specific TH reference ranges
   is important when evaluating clinicopathologic data in equids in order
   to avoid the misdiagnosis of thyroid gland dysfunction. Further studies
   to elucidate the physiological mechanisms leading to these differences
   are warranted.

   a protective cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase of the mitotic cell
   division cycle. This protective mechanism is thought to be defective in
   cancer cells. To investigate how this checkpoint is activated and
   maintained in healthy cells, we conducted a quantitative SILAC analysis
   of the nuclear- and cytoplasmic-enriched compartments of CDC7-depleted
   fibroblasts and compared them to a total cell lysate preparation.
   Substantial changes in total abundance and/or subcellular location were
   detected for 124 proteins, including many essential proteins associated
   with DNA replication/cell cycle. Similar changes in protein abundance
   and subcellular distribution were observed for various metabolic
   processes, including oxidative stress, iron metabolism, protein
   translation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This is accompanied by
   reduced abundance of two karyopherin proteins, suggestive of reduced
   nuclear import We propose that altered nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking
   plays a key role in the regulation of cell cycle arrest The results
   increase understanding of the mechanisms underlying maintenance of the
   DNA replication origin activation checkpoint and are consistent with our
   proposal that cell cycle arrest is an actively maintained process that
   appears to be distributed over various subcellular locations.

TI Conditional knockdown of DNA methyltransferase 1 reveals a key role of
   retinal pigment epithelium integrity in photoreceptor outer segment
   morphogenesis
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Dysfunction or death of photoreceptors is the primary cause of vision
   loss in retinal and macular degenerative diseases. As photoreceptors
   have an intimate relationship with the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
   for exchange of macromolecules, removal of shed membrane discs and
   retinoid recycling, an improved understanding of the development of the
   photoreceptor-RPE complex will allow better design of gene-and
   cell-based therapies. To explore the epigenetic contribution to retinal
   development we generated conditional knockout alleles of DNA
   methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in mice. Conditional Dnmt1 knockdown in
   early eye development mediated by Rx-Cre did not produce lamination or
   cell fate defects, except in cones; however, the photoreceptors
   completely lacked outer segments despite near normal expression of
   phototransduction and cilia genes. We also identified disruption of RPE
   morphology and polarization as early as E15.5. Defects in outer segment
   biogenesis were evident with Dnmt1 exon excision only in RPE, but not
   when excision was directed exclusively to photoreceptors. We detected a
   reduction in DNA methylation of LINE1 elements (a measure of global DNA
   methylation) in developing mutant RPE as compared with neural retina,
   and of Tuba3a, which exhibited dramatically increased expression in
   mutant retina. These results demonstrate a unique function of
   DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation in controlling RPE apicobasal polarity
   and neural retina differentiation. We also establish a model to study
   the epigenetic mechanisms and signaling pathways that guide the
   modulation of photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis by RPE during
   retinal development and disease.

TI Induction of a trophoblast-like phenotype by hydralazine in the p19
   embryonic carcinoma cell line
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH
AB Chemicals that affect cellular differentiation through epigenetic
   mechanisms have potential utility in treating a wide range of diseases.
   Hydralazine decreases DNA methylation in some cell types but its effect
   on differentiation has not been well explored. After five days of
   exposure to hydralazine, P19 embryocarcinoma cells displayed a giant
   cell morphology and were binucleate, indicative of a trophoblast-like
   morphology. Other trophoblast-like properties included the intermediary
   filament Troma-1/cytokeratin 8 and the transcription factor Tead4. A
   decrease in CpG methylation at three sites in the TEAD4 promoter and the
   81 repeated sequence was observed. Knocking down expression of Tead4
   with siRNA blocked the increase in Troma-1/cytokeratin 8 and over
   expression of Tead4 induced the expression of Troma-1/cytokeratin 8.
   Cells treated for 5 days with hydralazine were no longer capable of
   undergoing retinoic acid-mediated neuronal differentiation. An
   irreversible loss of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 was
   observed following hydralazine exposure. In summary, hydralazine induces
   P19 cells to assume a trophoblast-like phenotype by upregulating Tead4
   expression through a mechanism involving DNA demethylation. (C) 2012

TI Expression of the amelogenin Gene in the Skin of Xenopus tropicalis
SO ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB Anuran skin contains a calcified dermal layer, referred to as the
   Eberth-Kastschenko (EK) layer, which is found between the stratum
   spongiosum and the stratum compactum. Although it is established that
   some anuran species possess the EK layer, little is known about this
   layer from the standpoint of evolutionary and developmental biology. We
   conducted a morphological analysis by staining the dorsal skin from many
   species with alizarin red S to investigate the calcified layer. This
   layer was observed in all of the anurans tested, as well as in fishes
   and one species of caecilian with dermal scales, but not in urodeles,
   amniotes, or a scaleless caecilian. All of the investigated species with
   dermal scales exhibited a calcified layer in their dermis, while the
   anurans showed the EK layer, but no scales. We also analyzed the
   expression of genes related to scale formation (sparc, mmp9, and mmp2)
   in the dorsal skin of X. tropicalis. These genes were highly expressed
   at the metamorphic climax stage, which preceded the deposition of
   calcium. Furthermore, we examined the gene expression profile of
   amelogenin, the major protein found in the enamel matrix of the
   developing tooth. In X. tropicalis, amelogenin was upregulated in the
   skin at the climax stage and was expressed in the adult dermis at a high
   level. These data provide the first experimental evidence of the
   expression of amelogenin in the skin. These findings will lead to a
   better understanding of the developmental formation of the EK layer and
   the function of amelogenin.

TI Maternal behavior and offspring resiliency to maternal separation in
   c57bl/6 mice
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Adverse early life experience, such as childhood abuse, neglect, and
   trauma, increases lifetime risk for mental illness. To investigate
   underlying mechanisms, the maternal separation (MS) paradigm was
   developed and validated as an animal model of early adversity in rats,
   reliably effecting long-term changes to anxiety, gene expression, and
   stress response. However, across-species validation of core findings in
   mice has met with limited success. To re-visit parameters governing the
   effectiveness of MS in mice, this study investigated the effect of MS on
   maternal care, offspring behavior, and offspring stress-induced
   corticosterone response in the c57bl/6 mouse strain. The results from
   this study suggest that: (i) levels of maternal care increase as a
   function of separation duration immediately after daily MS, but
   long-term care remains unchanged; and (ii) c57bl/6 mice are resilient to
   MS, exhibiting subtle decreases in anxiety and unchanged stress-induced
   corticosterone response as adults, irrespective of separation duration.

TI Anteroposterior variation of the cell types in the interrenal gland of
   the male toad Rhinella arenarum (Amphibia, Anura)
SO JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY
AB The interrenal gland of anurans synthesizes the steroids aldosterone and
   corticosterone, but it is unknown whether these hormones are synthesized
   by the same cell type. In this work, we aim to elucidate whether there
   are different steroidogenic cell types and whether they have specific
   regionalization in the interrenal gland of the male toad Rhinella
   arenarum. We characterized all cell types using histological,
   immuhistochemical, and histochemical methods as well as transmission
   electron microscopy. Furthermore, we evaluated the organization of the
   cell types in the gland and anteroposterior variations in the synthesis
   of the steroids. We found evidence of five cell types: two
   morphologically different steroidogenic cells, type 1: polyhedral cells
   tightly attached to each other that have spherical euchromatic nuclei
   and type 2: retracted cells loosely attached to each other that have
   oval heterochromatic nuclei. Cell type 2 is mainly observed in the inner
   zone of the gland. In addition, we observed two types of chromaffin
   cells, called type 3 and 4 cells, randomly distributed throughout the
   interrenal gland, as well as type 5 cells, recognized as summer cells.
   Morphometric analyses of the cell types in the anterior and posterior
   zones of the interrenal showed that the ratio area of type 2 cells/total
   interrenal area is significantly lower in the posterior zone. In vitro
   incubations showed that the posterior portion of the gland produces
   significantly higher amounts of both corticosterone and aldosterone.
   Overall, our results suggest that the type 2 cells are less active to
   synthesize both aldosterone and corticosterone, compared to type 1
   cells. Unlike most previous reports on the interrenal gland of anurans,
   in R. arenarum there is a zonation of the steroidogenic cell types,
   which implies that the organ is not anteroposterior or dorsoventrally
   homogeneous. (c) J. Morphol., 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI TRIM28 repression of retrotransposon-based enhancers is necessary to
   preserve transcriptional dynamics in embryonic stem cells
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB TRIM28 is critical for the silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)
   in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we reveal that an essential impact
   of this process is the protection of cellular gene expression in early
   embryos from perturbation by cis-acting activators contained within
   these retroelements. In TRIM28-depleted ES cells, repressive chromatin
   marks at ERVs are replaced by histone modifications typical of active
   enhancers, stimulating transcription of nearby cellular genes, notably
   those harboring bivalent promoters. Correspondingly, ERV-derived
   sequences can repress or enhance expression from an adjacent promoter in
   transgenic embryos depending on their TRIM28 sensitivity in ES cells.
   TRIM28-mediated control of ERVs is therefore crucial not just to prevent
   retrotransposition, but more broadly to safeguard the transcriptional
   dynamics of early embryos.

TI Imprinted Igf2r silencing depends on continuous Airn IncRNA expression
   and is not restricted to a developmental window
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB The imprinted Airn macro long non-coding (Inc) RNA is an established
   example of a cis-silencing IncRNA. Airn expression is necessary to
   initiate paternal-specific silencing of the Igf2r gene, which is
   followed by gain of a somatic DNA methylation imprint on the silent
   Igf2r promoter. However, the developmental requirements for Airn
   initiation of Igf2r silencing and the role of Airn or DNA methylation in
   maintaining stable Igf2r repression have not been investigated. Here, we
   use inducible systems to control Airn expression during mouse embryonic
   stem cell (ESC) differentiation. By turning Airn expression off during
   ESC differentiation, we show that continuous Airn expression is needed
   to maintain Igf2r silencing, but only until the paternal Igf2r promoter
   is methylated. By conditionally turning Airn expression on, we show that
   Airn initiation of Igf2r silencing is not limited to one developmental
   'window of opportunity' and can be maintained in the absence of DNA
   methylation. Together, this study shows that Airn expression is both
   necessary and sufficient to silence Igf2r throughout ESC differentiation
   and that the somatic methylation imprint, although not required to
   initiate or maintain silencing, adds a secondary layer of repressive
   epigenetic information.

TI The Polycomb group protein MEDEA and the DNA methyltransferase MET1
   interact to repress autonomous endosperm development in Arabidopsis
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB In flowering plants, double fertilization of the female gametes, the egg
   and the central cell, initiates seed development to give rise to a
   diploid embryo and the triploid endosperm. In the absence of
   fertilization, the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED Polycomb Repressive
   Complex2 (FIS-PRC2) represses this developmental process by histone
   methylation of certain target genes. The FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED
   (FIS) class genes MEDEA (MEA) and FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM
   (FIE) encode two of the core components of this complex. In addition,
   DNA methylation establishes and maintains the repression of gene
   activity, for instance via DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), which
   maintains methylation of symmetric CpG residues. Here, we demonstrate
   that Arabidopsis MET1 interacts with MEA in vitro and in a yeast
   two-hybrid assay, similar to the previously identified interaction of
   the mammalian homologues DNMT1 and EZH2. MET1 and MEA share overlapping
   expression patterns in reproductive tissues before and after
   fertilization, a prerequisite for an interaction in vivo. Importantly, a
   much higher percentage of central cells initiate endosperm development
   in the absence of fertilization in mea-1/MEA;met1-3/MET1 as compared to
   mea-1/MEA mutant plants. In addition, DNA methylation at the PHERES1 and
   MEA loci, imprinted target genes of the FIS-PRC2, was affected in the
   mea-1 mutant compared with wild-type embryos. In conclusion, our data
   suggest a mechanistic link between two major epigenetic pathways
   involved in histone and DNA methylation in plants by physical
   interaction of MET1 with the FIS-PRC2 core component MEA. This concerted
   action is relevant for the repression of seed development in the absence
   of fertilization.

TI Thyroid hormone is required for growth adaptation to pressure load in
   the ovine fetal heart
SO EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB New Findings center dot What is the central question of this study? The
   importance of endogenous thyroid hormone in contributing to
   pathophysiological adaptive growth of the fetal heart is not known.
   center dot What is the main finding and its importance? The study
   identifies that thyroid hormone is required for adaptive fetal cardiac
   growth in response to pressure overload. Understanding the
   pathophysiological cardiac growth process may allow for improved
   clinical care and new therapeutic strategies for fetuses and infants
   with congenital heart disease. Thyroid hormone exerts broad effects on
   the adult heart, but little is known regarding the role of thyroid
   hormone in the regulation of cardiac growth early in development and in
   response to pathophysiological conditions. To address this issue, we
   determined the effects of fetal thyroidectomy on cardiac growth and
   growth-related gene expression in control and pulmonary-artery-banded
   fetal sheep. Fetal thyroidectomy (THX) and/or placement of a restrictive
   pulmonary artery band (PAB) were performed at 126 +/- 1 days of
   gestation (term, 145 days). Four groups of animals [n= 56 in each group;
   (i) control; (ii) fetal THX; (iii) fetal PAB; and (iv) fetal PAB + THX]
   were monitored for 1 week prior to being killed. Fetal heart rate was
   significantly lower in the two THX groups compared with the non-THX
   groups, while mean arterial blood pressure was similar among groups.
   Combined left and right ventricle free wall + septum weight, expressed
   per kilogram of fetal weight, was significantly increased in PAB (6.27
   +/- 0.85 g kg1) compared with control animals (4.72 +/- 0.12 g kg1).
   Thyroidectomy significantly attenuated the increase in cardiac mass
   associated with PAB (4.94 +/- 0.13 g kg1), while THX alone had no
   detectable effect on heart mass (4.95 +/- 0.27 g kg1). The percentage of
   binucleated cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased in THX and PAB
   +THX groups (approximate to 16%) compared with the non-THX groups
   (approximate to 27%). No differences in levels of activated Akt,
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase were
   detected among the groups. Markers of cellular proliferation but not
   apoptosis or expression of growth-related genes were lower in the THX
   and THX+ PAB groups relative to thyroid-intact animals. These findings
   suggest that in the late-gestation fetal heart, thyroid hormone has
   important cellular growth functions in both physiological and
   pathophysiological states. Specifically, thyroid hormone is required for
   adaptive fetal cardiac growth in response to pressure overload.

TI Utility of Thyroglobulin Measurements in Fine-Needle Aspirates of Space
   Occupying Lesions in the Thyroid Bed After Thyroid Cancer Operations
SO THYROID
AB Background: Ultrasound, and sometimes cytology, cannot differentiate
   between recurrent or persistent thyroid cancer and benign forms of space
   occupying lesions (SOLs) in the thyroid bed, including unsuspected
   thyroid remnants, that are noted several months to years after
   thyroidectomy (Tx) for thyroid cancer. The purpose of the present study
   was to evaluate the hypothesis that measurement of thyroglobulin (Tg) in
   fine-needle aspirates from these lesions might help differentiate
   between benign and malignant SOLs in the thyroid bed.
   Methods: We studied 47 lesions in the thyroid bed from 43 patients who,
   8-240 months previously, had 43 Txs for thyroid cancer. Eleven patients
   had a lobectomy and 32 patients had a total Tx. Also, some patients had
   radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation after their thyroid surgery and some
   did not. "Recurrence'' was defined as the SOL, which was confirmed by
   cytological or histopathological results. "Benign SOL'' was defined as a
   focal lesion, which was benign or nondiagnostic result on cytology and
   for which there was no RAI uptake on whole-body scintigraphy with both
   negative serum Tg and Tg antibodies. Diagnostic performances of
   fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), FNA-Tg, and combining FNAC with
   FNA-Tg level were assessed for detection of malignant SOL. The
   diagnostic performance of FNA-Tg was assessed using three threshold
   values: 1 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, and an FNA-Tg/serum-Tg ratio of 1.0.
   Results: FNA-Tg level and combining FNA-Tg levels with FNAC had higher
   sensitivities (100% in all three threshold values) and diagnostic
   accuracies (91.5%-95.7%) than FNAC alone (sensitivity of 85.3%, accuracy
   of 89.4%) in all threshold values. In both the RAI ablation and non-RAI
   ablation groups, the FNA-Tg levels and combining the FNA-Tg levels with
   FNAC had a higher sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy than FNAC alone
   with threshold values of 10 ng/mL and FNA-Tg/serum-Tg ratio of 1.0. The
   non-RAI ablation group did not have a different diagnostic accuracy than
   the RAI ablation group in all threshold values (p > 0.05). FNA-Tg level
   showed a negative predictive value of 100% in all threshold values, in
   both the RAI ablation and the non-RAI ablation groups.
   Conclusions: Measurement of Tg levels in the FNA of SOLs in the thyroid
   bed can be helpful in diagnosing tumor recurrence, because an FNA-Tg
   level lower than the threshold value has the added value of suggesting a
   benign lesion rather than tumor recurrence.

TI The promoter region of interferon-gamma is hypermethylated in neonatal
   foals and its demethylation is associated with increased gene expression
SO DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
AB While born with a limited production, foals' interferon-gamma
   (IFN-gamma) expression increases after birth. The underlying mechanisms
   remain unknown. DNA methylation is considered to be involved. Therefore,
   the DNA methylation status of the Ifng promoter in CD4(+) cells from
   neonatal foal was determined using a methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and
   its relevance to IFN-gamma mRNA expression was estimated. The effect of
   environment on the DNA methylation was also evaluated by comparing
   ponies that were kept in a barn versus those on pasture. The DNA in the
   Ifng promoter was hypermethylated and its demethylation was correlated
   with an increase in IFN-gamma mRNA expression and age. This
   age-associated demethylation was accelerated by barn-air exposure. In
   conclusion, IFN-gamma expression in foals appears to be controlled by
   DNA methylation in the promoter region of Ifng. The age-associated
   demethylation of the DNA in foals may be induced by exposure to
   environmental antigens and their effect on lymphoproliferation. (C) 2012

   spinal cord injury
SO JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE
AB Objectives: To evaluate the effect of cord injury on (1) sperm
   parameters and (2) DNA chromatin status.
   Design: Case-control study.
   Setting: Data were collected from men referred to Research and Clinical
   Center for Infertility, Yazd, Iran.
   Participants: Thirty infertile men with the presence of any level of
   spinal cord injury (SCI) were compared with 30 healthy donors with
   definite fertility and normal sperm parameters.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Outcome measures: Sperm chromatin integrity was assessed using aniline
   blue (AB), chromomycin A3 (CMA3), toluidine blue (TB), and acridine
   orange (AO) assays. The rate of apoptotic spermatozoa was evaluated with
   terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling
   (TUNEL) staining.
   Results: Sperm concentration, motility, and morphology in men with SCI
   were significantly decreased compared with control group (P < 0.05). In
   addition, with regard to cytochemical staining and TUNEL test, the rate
   of reacted spermatozoa was increased significantly in SCI group when
   compared with the controls (P < 0.05). The majority of AB, TB, AO, and
   CMA3-reacted spermatozoa were higher than the "cut-off" value in men
   with SCI, as were the number of apoptotic spermatozoa stained with
   TUNEL.
   Conclusion: Results showed that SCI disturbs sperm parameters, nuclear
   maturity, and DNA integrity of spermatozoa. Therefore, the production of
   spermatozoa with less condensed chromatin and more apoptotic rate
   increases after cord injury and this may be one possible cause of
   infertility following SCI.

TI Loss of trefoil factor 1 is regulated by DNA methylation and is an
   independent predictive factor for poor survival in advanced gastric
   cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene in
   gastric cancer. However, the role of TFF1 expression and its regulation
   in gastric cancer patients remain unclear. The aims of this study were
   to clarify the clinical significance of TFF1 and to determine its
   regulatory mechanisms. We assessed the immunohistochemical expression of
   TFF1 in 182 gastric cancer patients and examined whether or not TFF1 is
   associated with the clinicopathological factors and patient survival. In
   vitro study using TFF1 knockdown gastric cancer cells evaluated the role
   of TFF1 in cancer invasion. Bisulfite sequencing was performed to assess
   DNA methylation of TFF1 in cells and resected tissues. Patients with low
   expression of TFF1 showed a significantly deeper invasion of the tumor
   than those with high expression (p=0.037). Low expression of TFF1 was
   also associated with a poor survival (p=0.029) in 108 patients who were
   treated by surgery alone. Both TFF1 expression and lymph node metastasis
   are independent predictive factors for disease-specific survival in a
   multivariate analysis. In an in vitro study, invasive power of the cells
   was significantly increased in the TFF1-deficient cells compared with
   the control cells. Bisulfate sequencing showed that TFF1 expression is
   strongly dependent on DNA methylation in both gastric cancer cells and
   tissues. Interestingly, methylation status of two specific CpG sites,
   which are located close to a TATA box and hypoxia response element
   (HRE), determined the TFF1 expression in the resected tissues. TFF1
   expression is silenced by DNA methylation and is associated with tumor
   invasion and a poor survival in gastric cancer patients. The expression
   and/or methylation status of TFF1 may, therefore, serve as a useful
   biomarker for predicting survival in patients with advanced gastric
   cancer.

TI Identification and analysis of murine pancreatic islet enhancers
SO DIABETOLOGIA
AB The paucity of information on the epigenetic barriers that are blocking
   reprogramming protocols, and on what makes a beta cell unique, has
   hampered efforts to develop novel beta cell sources. Here, we aimed to
   identify enhancers in pancreatic islets, to understand their
   developmental ontologies, and to identify enhancers unique to islets to
   increase our understanding of islet-specific gene expression.
   We combined H3K4me1-based nucleosome predictions with pancreatic and
   duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1),
   v-Maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein A (MAFA)
   and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) occupancy data to identify enhancers in
   mouse islets.
   We identified 22,223 putative enhancer loci in in vivo mouse islets. Our
   validation experiments suggest that nearly half of these loci are active
   in regulating islet gene expression, with the remaining regions probably
   poised for activity. We showed that these loci have at least nine
   developmental ontologies, and that islet enhancers predominately acquire
   H3K4me1 during differentiation. We next discriminated 1,799 enhancers
   unique to islets and showed that these islet-specific enhancers have
   reduced association with annotated genes, and identified a subset that
   are instead associated with novel islet-specific long non-coding RNAs
   (lncRNAs).
   Our results indicate that genes with islet-specific expression and
   function tend to have enhancers devoid of histone methylation marks or,
   less often, that are bivalent or repressed, in embryonic stem cells and
   liver. Further, we identify a subset of enhancers unique to islets that
   are associated with novel islet-specific genes and lncRNAs. We
   anticipate that these data will facilitate the development of novel
   sources of functional beta cell mass.

TI Age- and Gender-Specific TSH Reference Intervals in People With No
   Obvious Thyroid Disease in Tayside, Scotland: The Thyroid Epidemiology,
   Audit, and Research Study (TEARS)
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the association of tested
   TSH with age, gender, and diabetes in a large population-based cohort
   without evidence of thyroid disease.
   Design: Record-linkage technology was used retrospectively to identify
   people without evidence of thyroid disease in the general population of
   Tayside, Scotland, from July 1, 2003, to December 31, 2009.
   Cohort: All Tayside residents who had thyroid function tests performed
   were identified. Using a unique patient identifier, data linkage enabled
   a cohort without thyroid disease to be identified by excluding anyone
   with thyroid or antithyroid prescription, thyroid-related admission or
   surgery, treatment with radioactive iodine and/or positive thyroid
   antibodies. Cases below 18 years of age were also excluded.
   Outcome Measures: We measured TSH distribution among different age
   groups and by gender.
   Results: We identified the latest TSH measurements in 153127 people from
   the reference population after applying the exclusion criteria. There
   was a significant increase in median TSH (1.58 mU/L at 31-40 y to 1.86
   mU/L at >90 y; P < .001) and 97.5th centile TSH (3.98 to 5.94 mU/L,
   respectively) with increasing age. The 2.5th centile decreased with age
   (0.51 to 0.31 mU/L). Patients with diabetes had marginally higher TSH
   concentration (1.80 vs 1.70 mU/L; P < .001).
   Conclusion: The use of these age-specific reference intervals for TSH,
   especially in those over 70 years old, would result in the
   reclassification of many TSH results from "abnormal" to "normal" (within
   the 95th centile reference interval) and avoid unnecessary treatment. (J

TI Methylation damage to RNA induced in vivo in Escherichia coli is
   repaired by endogenous AlkB as part of the adaptive response
SO DNA REPAIR
AB Cytotoxic 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) lesions
   induced in DNA and RNA in vitro and in pre-damaged DNA and RNA
   bacteriophages in vivo are repaired by the Escherichia coli (E. coli)
   protein AlkB and a human homolog, ALKBH3. However, it is not known
   whether endogenous RNA is repaired in vivo by repair proteins present at
   physiological concentrations. The concept of RNA repair as a
   biologically relevant process has therefore remained elusive. Here, we
   demonstrate AlkB-mediated repair of endogenous RNA in vivo by measuring
   differences in lesion-accumulation in two independent AlkB-proficient
   and deficient E. coli strains during exposure to methyl methanesulfonate
   (MMS). Repair was observed both in AlkB-overproducing strains and in the
   wild-type strains after AlkB induction. RNA repair appeared to be
   highest in RNA species below 200 nucleotides in size, mainly comprising
   tRNAs. Strikingly, at least 10-fold more lesions were repaired in RNA
   than in DNA. This may be a consequence of some 30-fold higher levels of
   aberrant methylation in RNA than in DNA after exposure to MMS. A high
   primary kinetic isotope effect (>10) was measured using a deuterated
   methylated RNA substrate, D-3-1me(rA), demonstrating that it is the
   catalytic step, and not the search step that is rate-limiting. Our
   results demonstrate that RNA repair by AlkB takes place in endogenous
   RNA as part of an adaptive response in wild-type E. coli cells. (c) 2012

TI Balanced chromosomal translocations in men: relationships among semen
   parameters, chromatin integrity, sperm meiotic segregation and
   aneuploidy
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB To analyse relationships between semen parameters, sperm chromatin
   integrity and frequencies of chromosomally unbalanced, disomic and
   diploid sperm in 13 Robertsonian and 37 reciprocal translocation
   carriers and to compare the results with data from 10 control donors.
   Conventional semen analysis, Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay and FISH
   with probes for chromosomes involved in the individual translocations
   and for chromosomes X, Y, 7, 8, 13, 18 and 21.
   Normal semen parameters were found in 30.8 % of Robertsonian and 59.5 %
   of reciprocal translocation carriers. The rates of unbalanced sperm were
   12.0 % in Robertsonian and 55.1 % in reciprocal translocation carriers
   with no difference between normospermic patients and those showing
   altered semen parameters. Significantly increased frequencies of
   spermatozoa showing defects in chromatin integrity and condensation,
   aneuploidy for chromosomes not involved in a translocation and diploidy
   were detected in translocation carriers with abnormal semen parameters.
   Normospermic reciprocal translocation carriers showed an increase in
   chromosome 13 disomy compared to the control group. There was no
   relationship between gametic and somatic aneuploidy in 12 translocation
   carriers studied by FISH on sperm and lymphocytes. The frequency of
   motile sperm was negatively correlated with the frequency of sperm
   showing disomy, diploidy and defective chromatin condensation.
   Abnormal semen parameters can serve as indicators of an additional risk
   of forming spermatozoa with defective chromatin and aneuploidy in
   translocation carriers.

TI Screening of candidate tumor-suppressor genes in 3p21.3 and
   investigation of the methylation of gene promoters in oral squamous cell
   carcinoma
SO ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of head and
   neck malignant tumor. However, its pathological mechanisms have not yet
   been elucidated. In the present study, we screened for candidate
   tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) related to OSCC among 10 candidate genes
   located in 3p21.3, a region abundant with TSGs based on previous
   studies, using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).
   Three genes, GNAT], SEMA3B and AXUD1, with low or no expression in OSCC
   tissues and the cell line TCA8113 were selected, and the promoter
   methylation status was further analyzed by methylation-specific PCR
   (MS-PCR). Hypermethylation in the promoter regions of SEMA3B was found
   in OSCC tissues, and a significant difference in the frequency of
   methylation of SEMA3B was Observed between OSCC and non-cancerous
   tissues. Furthermore, TCA8113 cells treated with 5-Aza-Cdc started to
   re-express SEMA3B at a concentration of 5 mu M or higher. Our study
   confirmed that three candidate TSGs with low expression may be involved
   in OSCC and that hypermethylation in promoter regions may contribute to
   the low expression of SEMA3B. These findings offer novel insights for
   clarifying the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis of OSCC as well as
   for aiding in its clinical diagnosis and therapeutic strategy.

TI Urinary Bisphenol A Concentration and Thyroid Function in Chinese Adults
SO EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor that in animal
   studies can bind to the thyroid hormone receptor and affect thyroid
   function. Relevant epidemiologic studies are limited and results are
   inconsistent. We explored the relationship between urinary BPA and
   thyroid function in a Chinese population.
   Methods: The study population included 3394 subjects age 40 years or
   older who were enrolled in a population-based study from Songnan
   Community, Baoshan District, Shanghai, China, from June through August
   2009. We analyzed the association between urinary BPA and thyroid
   function using multivariate linear regression. Participants were further
   divided according to thyroid function status, and logistic regression
   was applied to determine the relationship between urinary BPA and
   thyroid function.
   Results: Each one-quartile increase in BPA was related to an increase of
   0.068 pmol/l (95% confidence interval = 0.065-0.071) in free
   triiodothyronine and a 0.084 mu IU/ml decline (-0.099 to -0.069) in
   thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in men. For women, there was a 0.10
   pmol/l (0.09 to 0.11) increase in free triiodothyronine and a 0.13 mu
   IU/ml decline (-0.14 to -0.11) in TSH. High urinary BPA level was
   associated with increased thyroid function (adjusted odds ratio = 1.71
   [1.26 to 2.32]).
   Conclusions: Our results support previous reports of associations
   between BPA exposure and altered thyroid hormones in animal models and
   epidemiologic studies. Because our study is cross-sectional, no causal
   relationships can be established. (Epidemiology 2013; 24: 295-302)

CA Osteoporotic Fractures Men MrOS St
TI A prospective study of thyroid function, bone loss, and fractures in
   older men: The MrOS study
SO JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH
AB Excess thyroid hormone is associated with increased bone loss and
   fracture risk in older women, but few data exist for men. We sought to
   determine if thyroid function is independently associated with bone loss
   and fracture risk in older men. Data were analyzed from the Osteoporotic
   Fractures in Men (MrOS) study, a cohort of community-dwelling U.S. men
   aged 65years and older. Using a case-cohort design, fasting baseline
   serum archived at 80 degrees C was assayed for thyroid-stimulating
   hormone (thyrotropin) (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) in 397 men with
   confirmed nonspine fracture, including 157 hip fractures, and 1420
   randomly selected men without fracture. TSH and FT4 were analyzed as
   continuous variables and as thyroid function categories (subclinical
   hyperthyroid, euthyroid, and subclinical hypothyroid). Hip dual-energy
   X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic QDR4500) was measured at baseline
   and after a mean follow-up of 4.6years. Incident nonspine fractures were
   centrally adjudicated. Bone loss was evaluated with multivariate
   regression methods and fractures risk was evaluated using hazard models
   that accounted for the case-cohort sampling, adjusted for age,
   clinic-site, body mass index (BMI), race, physical activity,
   corticosteroid use, smoking, alcohol intake, and thyroid medication use.
   In fully adjusted analyses, TSH was not associated with risk of nonspine
   fracture (relative hazard [RH] 0.92 per SD decrease in TSH; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 0.741.14), but was significantly associated
   with risk of hip fracture (RH 1.31; 95% CI, 1.011.71), which persisted
   among normal range TSH values (RH 1.21; 95% CI, 1.001.47). There was no
   association between TSH or FT4 and bone loss, and fracture risk did not
   differ significantly by thyroid function category. We conclude that
   although neither TSH nor FT4 are associated with bone loss, lower serum
   TSH may be associated with an increased risk of hip fractures in older
   men. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

TI Cigarette smoke mediates epigenetic repression of miR-487b during
   pulmonary carcinogenesis
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB MicroRNAs are critical mediators of stem cell pluripotency,
   differentiation, and malignancy. Limited information exists regarding
   microRNA alterations that facilitate initiation and progression of human
   lung cancers. In this study, array techniques were used to evaluate
   microRNA expression in normal human respiratory epithelia and lung
   cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of cigarette smoke
   condensate (CSC). Under relevant exposure conditions, CSC significantly
   repressed miR-487b. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that miR-487b
   directly targeted SUZ12, BMI1, WNT5A, MYC, and KRAS. Repression of
   miR-487b correlated with overexpression of these targets in primary lung
   cancers and coincided with DNA methylation, de novo nucleosome
   occupancy, and decreased H2AZ and TCF1 levels within the miR-487b
   genomic locus. Deoxyazacytidine derepressed miR-487b and attenuated
   CSC-mediated silencing of miR-487b. Constitutive expression of miR-487b
   abrogated Wnt signaling, inhibited in vitro proliferation and invasion
   of lung cancer cells mediated by CSC or overexpression of miR-487b
   targets, and decreased growth and metastatic potential of lung cancer
   cells in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that miR-487b is a
   tumor suppressor microRNA silenced by epigenetic mechanisms during
   tobacco-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis and suggest that DNA
   demethylating agents may be useful for activating miR-487b for lung
   cancer therapy.

TI Promoter hypomethylation of TIMP3 is associated with pre-eclampsia in a
   Chinese population
SO MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB A study by Yuen RK, Penaherrera MS, von Dadelszen P, McFadden DE,
   Robinson WP. DNA methylation profiling of human placentas reveals
   promoter hypomethylation of multiple genes in early-onset preeclampsia.
   Eur J Hum Genet 2010;18:10061012 based on a Canadian population found
   the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) gene to be
   hypomethylated in pre-eclampsia (PE) placentas and to be a potential
   prenatal marker for early onset PE. To further explore the role of TIMP3
   in PE and to investigate whether the TIMP3 promoter shows the same
   methylation pattern in the Han Chinese population, we analyzed a
   complete methylation assay of TIMP3 including the promoter region
   studied in the Canadian report and the neighboring CpG island in
   placentas (cases n 41, controls n 22) maternal peripheral blood (cases n
   3; controls n 6) and umbilical cord blood (cases n 7; controls n 8)
   using MassArray EpiTyper (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Our results
   confirmed the finding of aberrant TIMP3 promoter methylation in PE
   placentas (mean 0.405) compared with those in controls (mean 0.534, P
   9.40 10(7)). A tissue-specific methylation pattern between placentas
   (mean 0.459) and bloods (mean 0.961, P 6.91 10(13)) was also
   demonstrated in our clinical samples. Furthermore, a nearly 2-fold
   increase in TIMP3 expression for the hypomethylated promoter was found
   in PE placentas (P 0.007), pointing to a negative relationship between
   TIMP3 methylation and the expression (R 0.758, P 0.029). In conclusion,
   we replicated the findings of Yuen et al. in our Han Chinese-based
   study, confirming that TIMP3 is likely to be involved in the etiology of
   PE and that hypomethylated and placenta-specific TIMP3 may be a
   potential marker for early diagnosis of PE in maternal plasma.

AB Serous borderline tumors (SBOTs) are a challenging group of ovarian
   tumors positioned between benign and malignant disease. We have profiled
   the DNA methylomes of 12 low-grade serous carcinomas (LGSCs), 19 SBOTs,
   and 16 benign serous tumors (BSTs) across 27,578 CpG sites to further
   characterize the epigenomic relationship between these subtypes of
   ovarian tumors. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of DNA methylation
   Levels showed that LGSCs differ distinctly from BSTs, but not from
   SBOTs. Gene ontology analysis of genes showing differential methylation
   at linked CpG sites between LGSCs and BSTs revealed significant
   enrichment of gene groups associated with cell adhesion, cell-cell
   signaling, and the extracellular region, consistent with a more invasive
   phenotype of LGSCs compared with BSTs. Consensus clustering highlighted
   differences between SBOT methylomes and returned subgroups with
   malignant- or benign-Like methylation profiles. Furthermore, a two-Loci
   DNA methylation signature can distinguish between these SBOT subgroups
   with benign- and malignant-like methylation characteristics. Our
   findings indicate striking similarities between SBOT and LGSC
   methylomes, supporting a common origin and the view that LGSC may arise
   from SBOT. A subgroup of SBOTs can be classified into tumors with a
   benign- or a malignant-like methylation profile that may help in
   identifying tumors more Likely to progress into LGSCs. (Am J Pathol

TI Regulation of nucleosome dynamics by histone modifications
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Chromatin is a dynamic structure that must respond to myriad stimuli to

   means by which the cell modulates nucleosome mobility and turnover.
   Histone modifications are linked to essentially every cellular process

   Here we consider properties of the major types of histone modification
   in the context of their associated biological processes to view them in

TI Vitamin and mineral supplements and thyroid cancer: a systematic review
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
AB The purpose of this study was to consolidate epidemiological evidence
   for the association between dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals
   and thyroid cancer development, as well as to contribute to
   evidence-based dietary recommendations for thyroid cancer primary
   prevention. We carried out a systematic literature review specifically
   for dietary supplement and thyroid cancer risk. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
   Dissertations and Theses were systematically searched to identify
   original epidemiological studies with a comparison group that
   investigated vitamin or mineral supplementation as an etiological factor
   for thyroid cancer. In total, 11 independent studies were identified and
   reviewed. Our qualitative summary showed conflicting results for common
   antioxidants including vitamins A, C, and E and beta-carotene in
   relation to thyroid cancer. Similarly, results for dietary supplement
   combinations as well as other individual vitamins and minerals (vitamin
   B complex, vitamin D, iodine, calcium, zinc, magnesium, and iron) are
   largely inconsistent across studies. Overall, our review suggested that
   the current evidence to support any protective or hazardous effect of
   vitamin or mineral supplements on thyroid cancer development is
   inconclusive and additional studies addressing previous limitations are
   necessary to elucidate this possible association. In particular, reverse
   causality is of major concern and should be addressed by prospective
   studies with large and representative samples. European Journal of

TI Involvement of parasympathetic pelvic efferent pathway in psychological
   stress-induced defecation
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: To investigate the role of the pelvic nerve pathway in
   stress-induced acceleration of colorectal transit and defecation in
   rats.
   METHODS: Surgical transection of rectal nerves (rectal branches of the
   pelvic nerve), vagotomy (Vag) or adrenalectomy (Adx) were performed
   bilaterally in rats. Number of fecal pellet output of these rats was
   measured during 1-h water avoidance stress (WAS). To evaluate the
   colonic transit, rats were given phenol red through the catheter
   indwelled in the proximal colon and subjected to WAS. After WAS session,
   entire colon and rectum were isolated and distribution of phenol red was
   measured. Distal colonic and rectal transit was evaluated using glass
   bead. Rats were inserted the glass bead into the distal colon and
   evacuation rate of the bead was measured. Neural activation was assessed
   by immunohistochemical staining of c-Fos and PGP9.5 in colonic
   whole-mount preparations of longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP).
   RESULTS: In the sham-operated rats (sham op), WAS significantly
   increased defecation and accelerated colorectal transit with marked
   elevation of plasma corticosterone level. Compared with sham-operated
   rats, increase in the excretion of fecal pellets during WAS was
   significantly reduced by rectal nerve transection (RNT) (sham op: 6.9
   +/- 0.8 vs RNT: 4.3 +/- 0.6, P < 0.05) or Vag (sham op: 6.4 +/- 0.8 vs
   Vag: 3.7 +/- 1.1, P < 0.05), although corticosterone level remained
   elevated. Adx-rats significantly increased the defecation despite the
   lower corticosterone level. Distribution pattern of phenol red showed
   RNT inhibited distal colonic and rectal transit accelerated by WAS,
   while Vag inhibited proximal colonic transit. Suppression of distal
   colonic and rectal transit by RNT was further confirmed by the bead
   evacuation rate (sham op: 80.0% vs RNT: 53.8%). WAS significantly
   increased the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive neural cells in the LMMP of
   the proximal and distal colon, whereas c-Fos expression was decreased by
   RNT in the distal colon (sham op: 9.0 +/- 2.0 vs RNT: 4.4 +/- 1.0, P <
   0.05) and decreased by Vag in the proximal colon.
   CONCLUSION: Pelvic nerve conveys WAS stimuli from the brain to the
   distal colon, and directly activate the myenteric neurons, followed by
   the increase of its motility. (C) 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI Promoter hypomethylation, especially around the E26
   transformation-specific motif, and increased expression of poly
   (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in BRCA-mutated serous ovarian cancer
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) overexpression plays
   a critical role in ovarian cancer progression and the clinical
   development of PARP1 inhibitors to treat BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer has
   advanced rapidly. However, the mechanism regulating PARP1 expression
   remains unknown. Alterations in gene expression mediated by promoter
   methylation are being increasingly recognized and have frequently been
   reported in ovarian cancer. We therefore investigated the methylation
   status of the PARP1 promoter region and its correlation with PARP1
   expression in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.
   Methods: DNA from BRCA-mutated serous ovarian cancer samples and
   adjacent normal ovarian tissues were analyzed by bisulfite sequence
   using primers focusing on the CpG island in the promoter region of
   PARP1. Expression levels of PARP1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry
   and real-time PCR.
   Results: Serous ovarian cancer tissues displayed decreased DNA
   methylation in the promoter region of PARP1 compared to normal tissue,
   and methylation intensity correlated inversely with PARP1 mRNA levels.
   More importantly, E26 transformation-specific (ETS) defined CpG sites
   were significantly less methylated in ovarian cancer samples.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that hypomethylation of the promoter
   region, especially around the ETS motif might play a role in the
   upregulation of PARP1 expression in the progression of ovarian cancer.

TI The DNA Repair Protein XRCC1 Functions in the Plant DNA Demethylation
   Pathway by Stimulating Cytosine Methylation (5-meC) Excision, Gap
   Tailoring, and DNA Ligation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB DNA methylation patterns are the dynamic outcome of antagonist
   methylation and demethylation mechanisms, but the latter are still
   poorly understood. Active DNA demethylation in plants is mediated by a
   family of DNA glycosylases typified by Arabidopsis ROS1 (repressor of
   silencing 1). ROS1 and its homologs remove 5-methylcytosine and incise
   the sugar backbone at the abasic site, thus initiating a base excision
   repair pathway that finally inserts an unmethylated cytosine. The DNA
   3'-phosphatase ZDP processes some of the incision products generated by
   ROS1, allowing subsequent DNA polymerization and ligation steps. In this
   work, we examined the possible role of plant XRCC1 (x-ray
   cross-complementing group protein 1) in DNA demethylation. We found that
   XRCC1 interacts in vitro with ROS1 and ZDP and stimulates the enzymatic
   activity of both proteins. Furthermore, extracts from xrcc1 mutant
   plants exhibit a reduced capacity to complete DNA demethylation
   initiated by ROS1. An anti-XRCC1 antibody inhibits removal of the
   blocking 3'-phosphate in the single-nucleotide gap generated during
   demethylation and reduces the capacity of Arabidopsis cell extracts to
   ligate a nicked DNA intermediate. Our results suggest that XRCC1 is a
   component of plant base excision repair and functions at several stages
   during active DNA demethylation in Arabidopsis.

TI Genome-wide analysis of thyroid hormone receptors shared and specific
   functions in neural cells
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB TR alpha 1 and TR beta 1, the two main thyroid hormone receptors in
   mammals, are transcription factors that share similar properties.
   However, their respective functions are very different. This functional
   divergence might be explained in two ways: it can reflect different
   expression patterns or result from different intrinsic properties of the
   receptors. We tested this second hypothesis by comparing the repertoires
   of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-responsive genes of two neural cell
   lines, expressing either TR alpha 1 or TR beta 1. Using transcriptome
   analysis, we found that a substantial fraction of the T3 target genes
   display a marked preference for one of the two receptors. So when placed
   alone in identical situations, the two receptors have different
   repertoires of target genes. Chromatin occupancy analysis, performed at
   a genome-wide scale, revealed that TR alpha 1 and TR beta 1 cistromes
   were also different. However, receptor-selective regulation of T3 target
   genes did not result from receptor-selective chromatin occupancy of
   their promoter regions. We conclude that modification of TR alpha 1 and
   TR beta 1 intrinsic properties contributes in a large part to the
   divergent evolution of the receptors' function, at least during
   neurodevelopment.

TI Osmotic Challenge Drives Rapid and Reversible Chromatin Condensation in
   Chondrocytes
SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Changes in extracellular osmolality have been shown to alter gene
   expression patterns and metabolic activity of various cell types,
   including chondrocytes. However, mechanisms by which physiological or
   pathological changes in osmolality impact chondrocyte function remain
   unclear. Here we use quantitative image analysis, electron microscopy,
   and a DNase I ass,ay to show that hyperosmotic conditions (>400 mOsm/kg)
   induce chromatin condensation, while hypoosmotic conditions (100
   mOsm/kg) cause decondensation. Large density changes (p < 0.001) occur
   over a very narrow range of physiological osmolalities, which suggests
   that chondrocytes likely experience chromatin condensation and
   decondensation during a daily loading cycle. The effect of changes in
   osmolality on nuclear morphology (p < 0.01) and chromatin condensation
   (p < 0.001) also differed between chondrocytes in monolayer culture and
   three-dimensional agarose, suggesting a role for cell adhesion. The
   relationship between condensation and osmolality was accurately modeled
   by a polymer gel model which, along with the rapid nature of the
   chromatin condensation (<20 s), reveals the basic physicochemical nature
   of the process. Alterations in chromatin structure are expected to
   influence gene expression and thereby regulate chondrocyte activity in
   response to osmotic changes.

TI A Matrix Protein Silences Transposons and Repeats through Interaction
   with Retinoblastoma-Associated Proteins
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB Epigenetic regulation helps to maintain genomic integrity by suppressing
   transposable elements (TEs) and also controls key developmental
   processes, such as flowering time [1-3]. To prevent TEs from causing
   rearrangements and mutations, TE and TE-like repetitive DNA sequences
   are usually methylated, whereas histones are hypoacetylated and
   methylated on specific residues (e.g., H3 lysine 9 dimethylation
   [H3K9me2]) [4, 5]. TEs and repeats can also attenuate gene expression
   [2, 6-8]. However, how various histone modifiers are recruited to target
   loci is not well understood. Here we show that knockdown of the nuclear
   matrix protein with AT-hook DNA binding motifs [9-11] TRANSPOSABLE
   ELEMENT SILENCING VIA AT-HOOK (TEK) in Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta
   results in robust activation of various TEs, the TE-like
   repeat-containing floral repressor genes FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FWA
   [1, 2, 12]. This derepression is associated with chromatin
   conformational changes, increased histone acetylation, reduced H3K9me2,
   and even TE transposition. TEK directly binds to an FLC-repressive
   regulatory region and the silencing repeats of FWA and associates with
   Arabidopsis homologs of the Retinoblastoma-associated protein 46/48, FVE
   and MSI5, which mediate histone deacetylation [13, 14]. We propose that
   the nuclear matrix protein TEK acts in the maintenance of genome
   integrity by silencing TE and repeat-containing genes.

TI Thyroid cancer risk and dietary nitrate and nitrite intake in the
   Shanghai Women's Health Study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Nitrate and nitrite are precursors in the endogenous formation of
   N-nitroso compounds and nitrate can disrupt thyroid homeostasis by
   inhibiting iodide uptake. We evaluated nitrate and nitrite intake and
   risk of thyroid cancer in the Shanghai Women's Health Study that
   included 73,317 women, aged 40-70 years enrolled in 1996-2000. Dietary
   intake was assessed at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire.
   During approximately 11 years of follow-up, 164 incident thyroid cancer
   cases with complete dietary information were identified. We used Cox
   proportional hazards regression to estimate relative risks (RRs). We
   determined the nitrate and nitrite contents of foods using values from
   the published literature and focusing on regional values for Chinese
   foods. Nitrate intake was not associated with thyroid cancer risk
   [RR(Q4) = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-2.07; p for trend =
   0.40]. Compared to the lowest quartile, women with the highest dietary
   nitrite intake had about a twofold risk of thyroid cancer (RR(Q4) =
   2.05; 95% CI: 1.20-3.51), but there was not a monotonic trend with
   increasing intake (p for trend = 0.36). The trend with increasing
   nitrite intake from animal sources was significant (p for trend = 0.02)
   and was stronger for nitrite from processed meats (RR(Q4) = 1.96; 95%
   CI: 1.28-2.99; p for trend < 0.01). Although we did not observe an
   association for nitrate as hypothesized, our results suggest that women
   consuming higher levels of nitrite from animal sources, particularly
   from processed meat, may have an increased risk of thyroid cancer.

TI Epigenetic Regulation of miR-17 similar to 92 Contributes to the
   Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Fibrosis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of
   progressive lung fibrosis with a high mortality rate. In organ repair
   and remodeling, epigenetic events are important. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
   regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and can target
   epigenetic molecules important in DNA methylation. The miR-17 similar to
   92 miRNA cluster is critical for lung development and lung epithelial
   cell homeostasis and is predicted to target fibrotic genes and DNA
   methyltransferase (DNMT)-1 expression.
   Objectives: We investigated the miR-17 similar to 92 cluster expression
   and its role in regulating DNA methylation events in IPF lung tissue.
   Methods: Expression and DNA methylation patterns of miR-17 similar to 92
   were determined in human IPF lung tissue and fibroblasts and fibrotic
   mouse lung tissue. The relationship between the miR-17 similar to 92
   cluster and DNMT-1 expression was examined in vitro. Using a murine
   model of pulmonary fibrosis, we examined the therapeutic potential of
   the demethylating agent, 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.
   Measurements and Main Results: Compared with control samples, miR-17
   similar to 92 expression was reduced in lung biopsies and lung
   fibroblasts from patients with IPF, whereas DNMT-1 expression and
   methylation of the miR-17 similar to 92 promoter was increased. Several
   miRNAs from the miR-17 similar to 92 cluster targeted DNMT-1 expression
   resulting in a negative feedback loop. Similarly, miR-17 similar to 92
   expression was reduced in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. Treatment
   with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in a murine bleomycin-induced pulmonary
   fibrosis model reduced fibrotic gene and DNMT-1 expression, enhanced
   miR-17 similar to 92 cluster expression, and attenuated pulmonary
   fibrosis.
   Conclusions: This study provides insight into the pathobiology of IPF
   and identifies a novel epigenetic feedback loop between miR-17 similar
   to 92 and DNMT-1 in lung fibrosis.

TI Growth and biochemistry of the spiny lobster Sagmariasus verreauxi
   cultured at low and high density from hatch to puerulus
SO AQUACULTURE
AB Stocking density is an important factor affecting the competency of
   later stage lecithotrophic spiny lobster larvae, yet its influence on
   biochemical composition has rarely been considered. Biochemical analysis
   of phyllosoma during ontogeny provides information on the energy storage
   requirements of late instar phyllosoma and their ability to survive
   metamorphosis and achieve the energetic demands of the puerulus stage.
   The current study is the first to examine biochemical composition of
   spiny lobsters through the entire larval phase. Survival, growth,
   development, and biochemical composition were measured in Sagmariasus
   verreauxi phyllosoma that were cultured at High Density (HD) and Low
   Density (LD) from hatch to puerulus. Protein measured directly by Lowry
   was considerably lower than crude protein as calculated from nitrogen
   (N) content using Nx6.25, suggesting that a conversion factor of 6.25
   was too high. Survival of phyllosoma was significantly higher in the HD
   treatment after instar 9 due to high mortalities of LD phyllosoma caused
   by high ozonation during instar 9. However, HD phyllosoma were less
   susceptible to the high ozonation event possibly due to the larger
   biomass in HD tanks. Phyllosoma growth and development were more
   advanced in LD phyllosoma after 108 d. Instar 17 LD phyllosoma were also
   significantly larger than instar 17 HD phyllosoma. The C: N ratio
   confirmed proportionally more lipid than protein was accumulated during
   larval development before a significant decrease in lipid reserves
   between instar 17 and the puerulus stage by over 21% to fuel the process
   of metamorphosis and the non-feeding puerulus stage. The study
   demonstrated the larval phase of S. verreauxi is important for
   accumulating lipid reserves to fuel metamorphosis and the puerulus stage
   and provides a more complete picture of the culture requirements of
   spiny lobsters during ontogeny, particularly for the rarely studied late
   phyllosoma instars. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   metamorphosis in marine invertebrates typically occur in response to
   environmental, chemical and/or physical cues. The effect of several
   environmental factors, bacteria biofilms and analogues of natural
   inducers on settlement and metamorphosis of different bivalve larvae has
   been reported. However, there are no studies about the effect of
   chemical inducers on the settlement and production of flat oyster larvae
   under laboratory and hatchery conditions.
   In the present study, competent larvae of the flat oyster O. edulis were
   induced to settle by exposure to the neurotransmitter GABA, L-DOPA, the
   catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and IBMX, under
   laboratory conditions. After 24 h, maximum percentages of settlement
   were induced by 10(-4) M IBMX, 10(-4) M L-DOPA, 10(-5) M GABA and 10(-6)
   M epinephrine. Exposure to IBMX and norepinephrine also induced
   significant levels of settlement in Ostrea after 48 h. In contrast,
   10(-4), and 10(-5) M epinephrine and 10-6 M L-DOPA failed to induce
   significantly higher settlement rates than the control larvae. GABA was
   found to be the most effective inducer. Maximum settlement rate was
   achieved by 10(-4) M GABA (>64%), four times higher compared to the
   control larvae. Exposure to 10(-5) M and 10(-6) M GABA also induced a
   significantly higher larval settlement. Mortality of O. edulis larvae
   was not affected by the chemical inducers. In hatchery conditions, GABA
   was an active and fast inducer of settlement and metamorphosis. 10-6 M
   GABA promoted synchronisation of larvae and positively affected the spat
   growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Multiple roles for Piwi in silencing Drosophila transposons
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB Silencing of transposons in the Drosophila ovary relies on three Piwi
   family proteins-Piwi, Aubergine (Aub), and Ago3-acting in concert with
   their small RNA guides, the Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Aub and Ago3
   are found in the germ cell cytoplasm, where they function in the
   ping-pong cycle to consume transposon mRNAs. The nuclear Piwi protein is
   required for transposon silencing in both germ and somatic follicle
   cells, yet the precise mechanisms by which Piwi acts remain largely
   unclear. We investigated the role of Piwi by combining cell
   type-specific knockdowns with measurements of steady-state transposon
   mRNA levels, nascent RNA synthesis, chromatin state, and small RNA
   abundance. In somatic cells, Piwi loss led to concerted effects on
   nascent transcripts and transposon mRNAs, indicating that Piwi acts
   through transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). In germ cells, Piwi loss
   showed disproportionate impacts on steady-state RNA levels, indicating
   that it also exerts an effect on post-transcriptional gene silencing
   (PTGS). Piwi knockdown affected levels of germ cell piRNAs presumably
   bound to Aub and Ago3, perhaps explaining its post-transcriptional
   impacts. Overall, our results indicate that Piwi plays multiple roles in
   the piRNA pathway, in part enforcing transposon repression through
   effects on local chromatin states and transcription but also
   participating in germ cell piRNA biogenesis.

TI Inducible mouse models illuminate parameters influencing epigenetic
   inheritance
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Environmental factors can stably perturb the epigenome of exposed
   individuals and even that of their offspring, but the pleiotropic
   effects of these factors have posed a challenge for understanding the
   determinants of mitotic or transgenerational inheritance of the
   epigenetic perturbation. To tackle this problem, we manipulated the
   epigenetic states of various target genes using a tetracycline-dependent
   transcription factor. Remarkably, transient manipulation at appropriate
   times during embryogenesis led to aberrant epigenetic modifications in
   the ensuing adults regardless of the modification patterns, target gene
   sequences or locations, and despite lineage-specific epigenetic
   programming that could reverse the epigenetic perturbation, thus
   revealing extraordinary malleability of the fetal epigenome, which has
   implications for 'metastable epialleles'. However, strong
   transgenerational inheritance of these perturbations was observed only
   at transgenes integrated at the Col1a1 locus, where both activating and
   repressive chromatin modifications were heritable for multiple
   generations; such a locus is unprecedented. Thus, in our inducible
   animal models, mitotic inheritance of epigenetic perturbation seems
   critically dependent on the timing of the perturbation, whereas
   transgenerational inheritance additionally depends on the location of
   the perturbation. In contrast, other parameters examined, particularly
   the chromatin modification pattern and DNA sequence, appear irrelevant.

TI The NeST Long ncRNA Controls Microbial Susceptibility and Epigenetic
   Activation of the Interferon-gamma Locus
SO CELL
AB Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) are increasingly appreciated as regulators
   of cell-specific gene expression. Here, an enhancer-like IncRNA termed
   NeST (nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler's [cleanup Salmonella not
   Theiler's]) is shown to be causal for all phenotypes conferred by murine
   viral susceptibility locus Tmevp3. This locus was defined by crosses
   between SJL/J and B10.S mice and contains several candidate genes,
   including NeST. The SJL/J-derived locus confers higher IncRNA
   expression, increased interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) abundance in
   activated CD8(+) T cells, increased Theiler's virus persistence, and
   decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis. Transgenic expression of
   NeST IncRNA alone was sufficient to confer all phenotypes of the SJL/J
   locus. NeST RNA was found to bind WDR5, a component of the histone H3
   lysine 4 methyltransferase complex, and to alter histone 3 methylation
   at the IFN-gamma locus. Thus, this IncRNA regulates epigenetic marking
   of IFN-gamma-encoding chromatin, expression of IFN-gamma, and
   susceptibility to a viral and a bacterial pathogen.

TI Influence of developmental lead exposure on expression of DNA
   methyltransferases and methyl cytosine-binding proteins in hippocampus
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB Developmental exposure to lead (Pb) has adverse effects on cognitive
   functioning and behavior that can persist into adulthood. Exposures that
   occur during fetal or early life periods may produce changes in brain
   related to physiological re-programming from an epigenetic influence
   such as altered DNA methylation status. Since DNA methylation is
   regulated by DNA methyltransferases and methyl cytosine-binding
   proteins, this study assessed the extent to which developmental Pb
   exposure might affect expression of these proteins in the hippocampus.
   Long Evans dams were fed chow with or without added Pb acetate (0, 150,
   375, 750 ppm) prior to breeding and remained on the same diet through
   weaning (perinatal exposure group). Other animals were exposed to the
   same doses of Pb but exposure started on postnatal day 1 and continued
   through weaning (early postnatal exposure group). All animals were
   euthanized on day 55 and hippocampi were removed. Western blot analyses
   showed significant effects of Pb exposure on DNMT1, DNMT3a, and MeCP2
   expression, with effects often seen at the lowest level of exposure and
   modified by sex and developmental window of Pb exposure. These data
   suggest potential epigenetic effects of developmental Pb exposure on DNA
   methylation mediated at least in part through dysregulation of
   methyltransferases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI In Vivo Epigenomic Profiling of Germ Cells Reveals Germ Cell Molecular
   Signatures
SO DEVELOPMENTAL CELL
AB The limited number of in vivo germ cells poses an impediment to
   genome-wide studies. Here, we applied a small-scale chromatin
   immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) method on purified mouse fetal
   germ cells to generate genome-wide maps of four histone modifications
   (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and H2BK2oac). Comparison of active
   chromatin state between somatic, embryonic stem, and germ cells revealed
   promoters and enhancers needed for stem cell maintenance and germ cell
   development. We found the nuclear receptor Nr5a2 motif to be enriched at
   a subset of germ cell cis-regulatory regions, and our results implicate
   Nr5a2 in germ cell biology. Interestingly, in germ cells, the H3K27me3
   histone modification occurs more frequently at regions that are enriched
   for retrotransposons and MHC genes, indicating that these loci are
   specifically silenced in germ cells. Together, our study provides
   genome-wide histone modification maps of in vivo germ cells and reveals
   the molecular chromatin signatures of germ cells.

TI Bisphenol A interferes with thyroid specific gene expression
SO TOXICOLOGY
AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that leads to
   low-dose human exposure due to its ability to leach from chemically
   derived products, as polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resin. In addition
   to its known xeno-endocrine action, BPA exerts a wide range of metabolic
   effects. Despite the documented BPA exposure outcomes on synthesis of
   thyroid hormones, there are not any data available on its actions on the
   thyroid follicular cells, site of synthesis of the thyroid hormones.
   Recently, it has been shown that several environmental pollutants, as
   BPA, can exert a thyroid disrupting activity.
   In this study, we employed in vitro and in vivo (zebrafish) models to
   examine the effects of BPA in regulating the expression of genes
   involved in the thyroid hormone synthesis and of their transcriptional
   regulators at BPA doses as low as 10(-9) M, a dose that is
   environmentally pertinent and far below the one detected in infants
   plasma. In both systems we could detect an altered expression of the
   genes involved in thyroid hormones synthesis and of thyroid specific
   transcriptional factors in BPA dose and time dependent manner.
   Our results suggest that BPA exerts a direct effect on thyroid
   follicular cell. We show that these cells can "sense" very low amount of
   BPA. Thus they, potentially, represent an ideal in vitro system to
   develop assays to detect BPA and other pollutants with thyroid
   disrupting activity at level far below the ones considered to be
   environmental relevant. Moreover, this report may provide new insight
   into the mode of BPA-induced deregulation of physiological processes as
   well as on the extensively debated molecular pathways underlying its
   biological activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

TI Heterochromatin protein 1 gamma overexpression in P19 embryonal
   carcinoma cells elicits spontaneous differentiation into the three germ
   layers
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells are pluripotent stem cells and have
   numerous morphological and biochemical properties in common with
   embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, P19 cells differentiate very
   ineffectively as embryoid bodies (EBs) without the specific chemical
   inducers whereas ES cells exhibit spontaneous differentiation to the
   three germ layers. Recently the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family
   protein HP1 gamma, which is an epigenetic modulator that binds histone
   H3 methylated at lysine 9, is shown to be associated with the
   progression from pluripotent to differentiated status in ES cells.
   Therefore, to study the role of HP1 gamma in the differentiation
   capacity of P19 cells, we have established a HP1 gamma-over-expressing
   P19 cell line (HP1 gamma-P19). Similar to the parental P19 cells,
   undifferentiated HP1 gamma-P19 cells continued to express pluripotency
   marker genes. However, HP1 gamma-P19 cells exhibited significant
   morphological differentiation including beating cardiomyocytes, as well
   as Tuj1-positive neuronal cells and Sox17-positive endodermal cells
   after EB formation under a normal culture condition. Moreover, real-time
   RT-qPCR analysis revealed that HP1 gamma-P19 EB cells expressed various
   differentiation marker genes. Thus, HP1 gamma-P19 cells could give rise
   to all three germ layers in EBs without any drug treatment. Therefore,
   HP1 gamma affects the spontaneous differentiation potential of P19
   cells, and might play major roles in the decision of cell fates in
   pluripotent stem cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Correlated Spatio-Temporal Fluctuations in Chromatin Compaction States
   Characterize Stem Cells
SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Stem cells integrate signals from the microenvironment to generate
   lineage-specific gene expression programs upon differentiation.
   Undifferentiated cell nuclei are easily deformable, with an active
   transcriptome, whereas differentiated cells have stiffer nuclei and
   condensed chromatin. Chromatin organization in the stem cell state is
   known to be highly dynamic but quantitative characterizations of its
   plasticity are lacking. Using fluorescence imaging, we study the
   spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear architecture and chromatin
   compaction in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and differentiated states.
   Individual ES cells exhibit a relatively narrow variation in chromatin
   compaction, whereas primary Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEF) show
   broad distributions. However, spatial correlations in chromatin
   compaction exhibit an emergent length scale in PMEFs, although they are
   unstructured and longer ranged in ES cells. We provide evidence for
   correlated fluctuations with large amplitude and long intrinsic
   timescales, including an oscillatory component, in both chromatin
   compaction and nuclear area in ES cells. Such fluctuations are largely
   frozen in PMEF. The role of actin and Lamin A/C in modulating these
   fluctuations is described. A simple theoretical formulation reproduces
   the observed dynamics. Our results suggest that, in addition to nuclear
   plasticity, correlated spatio-temporal structural fluctuations of
   chromatin in undifferentiated cells characterize the stem cell state.

TI Hypothermia enhances induction of protective protein metallothionein
   under ischemia
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION
AB Background: Hypothermic protection against ischemic stroke has been
   reported by many studies. Hypothermia is supposed to mitigate the
   effects of deleterious genes and proteins and promote the activity of
   protective genes and proteins in the ischemic brain. Metallothionein
   (MT)-1/2 is thought to be a crucial factor for metal homeostasis, immune
   function, and apoptosis. This protein was found to exert protective
   effects in models of brain injury as well. In the present study, we
   investigated the effect of hypothermia on MT expression and the
   underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Cultured bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells were exposed to oxygen
   glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD+R). Reverse transcription PCR
   and western blot analyses were performed to measure the expression of
   MT, transcription factors, and methylation regulating factors.
   Transcription factor binding assays were also performed. Methylation
   profiles of the promoter area were obtained with pyrosequencing.
   Results: Hypothermia protected bEnd. 3 cells from OGD+R. When the cells
   were exposed to OGD+R, MT expression was induced. Hypothermia augmented
   MT levels. While OGD+R-induced MT expression was mainly associated with
   metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF-1), MT expression promoted
   by hypothermia was primarily mediated by the signal transducer and
   activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Significantly increased STAT3
   phosphorylation at Ser727 was observed with hypothermia, and JSI-124, a
   STAT-3 inhibitor, suppressed MT expression. The DNA demethylating drug
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) enhanced MT expression. Some of the CpG
   sites in the promoter MT=> it should be "the CpG sites in the MT
   promoter" showed different methylation profiles and some methylation
   regulating factors had different expressional profiles in the presence
   of OGD+R and hypothermia.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that hypothermia is a potent inducer of MT
   gene transcription in brain endothelial cells, and enhanced MT
   expression might contribute to protection against ischemia. MT gene
   expression is induced by hypothermia mainly through the STAT3 pathway.
   DNA methylation may contribute to MT gene regulation under ischemic or
   hypothermic conditions.

TI Effects of stolbur phytoplasma infection on DNA methylation processes in
   tomato plants
SO PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB DNA methylation was investigated as a possible mechanism for regulation
   of floral gene expression in stolbur phytoplasma-infected tomato buds.
   Expression of methylase and demethylase genes was found to be globally
   down-regulated in tomato plants infected with stolbur isolate PO, but
   not in those infected with isolate C. These results are consistent with
   the finding that SlDEF, a gene orthologous to arabidopsis APETALA3 which
   is involved in petal formation, was down-regulated in stolbur
   PO-infected buds and remained unaffected in stolbur C-infected buds, and
   with the fact that the two stolbur phytoplasma isolates C and PO induce
   distinct symptoms. Because of variations between the different
   cell-types of the flower buds, the DNA methylation status of SlDEF could
   not be clearly established. However, the finding that treatment of
   stolbur PO-infected plants with 5-azacytidine partially restored SlDEF
   gene expression strongly suggests that DNA methylation is involved in
   down-regulation of floral development genes in stolbur PO-infected
   tomatoes.

TI Inhibition of EZH2 suppresses self-renewal and induces radiation
   sensitivity in atypical rhabdoid teratoid tumor cells
SO NEURO-ONCOLOGY
AB Introduction. Overexpression of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)
   subunit Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) occurs in several malignancies,
   including prostate cancer, breast cancer, medulloblastoma, and
   glioblastoma multiforme. Recent evidence suggests that EZH2 may also
   have a role in rhabdoid tumors. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT)
   is a rare, high-grade embryonal brain tumor that occurs most commonly in
   young children and carries a very poor prognosis. ATRTs are
   characterized by absence of the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCB1.
   Given the role of EZH2 in regulating epigenetic changes, we investigated
   the role of EZH2 in ATRT.
   Methods. Microarray analysis was used to evaluate expression of EZH2 in
   ATRT tumor samples. We used shRNA and a chemical inhibitor of EZH2 to
   examine the impact of EZH2 inhibition on cell growth, proliferation, and
   tumor cell self-renewal.
   Results. Here, we show that targeted disruption of EZH2 by RNAi or
   pharmacologic inhibition strongly impairs ATRT cell growth, suppresses
   tumor cell self-renewal, induces apoptosis, and potently sensitizes
   these cells to radiation. Using functional analysis of transcription
   factor activity, we found the cyclin D1-E2F axis to be repressed after
   EZH2 depletion in ATRT cells.
   Conclusions. Our observations provide evidence that EZH2 disruption
   alters cell cycle progression and may be an important new therapeutic
   target, particularly in combination with radiation, in ATRT.

TI Adaptive radiation-induced epigenetic alterations mitigated by
   antioxidants
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB Humans are exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from a number
   of environmental and medical sources. In addition to inducing genetic
   mutations, there is concern that LDIR may also alter the epigenome. Such
   heritable effects early in life can either be positively adaptive or
   result in the enhanced formation of diseases, including cancer,
   diabetes, and obesity. Herein, we show that LDIR significantly increased
   DNA methylation at the viable yellow agouti (A(vy)) locus in a
   sex-specific manner (P=0.004). Average DNA methylation was significantly
   increased in male offspring exposed to doses between 0.7 and 7.6 cGy,
   with maximum effects at 1.4 and 3.0 cGy (P<0.01). Offspring coat color
   was concomitantly shifted toward pseudoagouti (P<0.01). Maternal dietary
   antioxidant supplementation mitigated both the DNA methylation changes
   and coat color shift in the irradiated offspring. Thus, LDIR exposure
   during gestation elicits epigenetic alterations that lead to positive
   adaptive phenotypic changes that are negated with antioxidants,
   indicating they are mediated in part by oxidative stress. These findings
   provide evidence that in the isogenic A(vy) mouse model, epigenetic
   alterations resulting from LDIR play a role in radiation hormesis,
   bringing into question the assumption that every dose of radiation is
   harmful.-Bernal, A. J., Dolinoy, D. C., Huang, D., Skaar, D. A.,

TI Evaluating stress in natural populations of vertebrates: total CORT is
   not good enough
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Our goal in this review is to discuss how measures beyond simple
   quantification of total glucocorticoid levels are needed in comparative
   studies of stress. We need to measure corticosteroid binding globulin
   CBG and further downstream performance metrics to properly evaluate the
   significance and impact of stress in wild populations. We briefly cover
   the current literature, discuss methods that may enable detection of
   chronic stress and point to directions for future research to continue
   to clarify this field. CBG may regulate access of hormones to tissues,
   but disagreement remains as to the functional importance of total vs.
   free vs. bound hormone in the plasma. Here we focus on recent studies
   providing solid evidence supporting the free hormone hypothesis. These
   studies unequivocally indicate that the biologically active fraction
   consists only of the portion that is free (not total levels in the
   blood). We also present the reservoir hormone hypothesis, indicating the
   relevance of CBG-bound hormone in the plasma. The vast majority of
   physiological studies on stress in natural populations only measure
   blood corticosterone or its faecal metabolites. However, downstream
   metrics (e.g. immune function, oxidative stress and body mass changes)
   can assess the physiological impact of the changes in corticosterone and
   CBG and ultimately of the adaptiveness of these changes. Here we will
   discuss some of the most promising factors that can be measured
   downstream of the plasma and the rationale for their measurement, how to
   do it, and an introduction to the evidence. Although we draw on
   biomedical findings for some of this insight, we recognized that
   findings from a few mammalian laboratory species (primarily rats and
   mice) may not apply to the vast diversity of vertebrate species from
   fish to birds. In large measure we are still in the natural history
   phase of the accumulation of fundamental knowledge in terms of trying to
   extract general principles in the stress biology of natural populations.
   Our review outlines what is needed to lay the foundation for these
   principles.

TI Bookmarking by specific and nonspecific binding of FoxA1 pioneer factor
   to mitotic chromosomes
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB While most transcription factors exit the chromatin during mitosis and
   the genome becomes silent, a subset of factors remains and "bookmarks"
   genes for rapid reactivation as cells progress through the cell cycle.
   However, it is unknown whether such bookmarking factors bind to
   chromatin similarly in mitosis and how different binding capacities
   among them relate to function. We compared a diverse set of
   transcription factors involved in liver differentiation and found
   markedly different extents of mitotic chromosome binding. Among them,
   the pioneer factor FoxA1 exhibits the greatest extent of mitotic
   chromosome binding. Genomically, similar to 15% of the FoxA1 interphase
   target sites are bound in mitosis, including at genes that are important
   for liver differentiation. Biophysical, genome mapping, and mutagenesis
   studies of FoxA1 reveals two different modes of binding to mitotic
   chromatin. Specific binding in mitosis occurs at sites that continue to
   be bound from interphase. Nonspecific binding in mitosis occurs across
   the chromosome due to the intrinsic chromatin affinity of FoxA1. Both
   specific and nonspecific binding contribute to timely reactivation of
   target genes post-mitosis. These studies reveal an unexpected diversity
   in the mechanisms by which transcription factors help retain cell
   identity during mitosis.

TI HOW STRESSED ARE BIRDS IN AN URBANIZING LANDSCAPE? RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
   THE PHYSIOLOGY OF BIRDS AND THREE LEVELS OF HABITAT ALTERATION
SO CONDOR
AB In this study we measured two physiological traits (levels of
   corticosterone and immunoglobulin) in two species of landbirds, the
   Canyon Towhee (Melozone fusca) and Inca Dove (Columbina inca), occupying
   three degrees of human alteration of a subtropical mountain landscape:
   forest edges, croplands, and urban sites. We found that both
   physiological variables differed by species and habitat condition. In
   both species, corticosterone concentration was significantly higher in
   croplands. But immunoglobulin concentration behaved differently, in C.
   inca being highest at urban sites, where in M. fusca it was lowest.
   Contrary to expectation, we only found one strong significant
   relationship between both physiological variables: M fusca in urban
   areas. Our results suggest that 30% of the towhees captured in urban
   areas are under chronic stress. Results for body condition support this
   hypothesis, as the condition of towhees in urban areas was poorer,
   suggesting physiological vulnerability. Although we expected the density
   of both species to be high in urban areas because of the amount and
   predictability of resources, we found a significantly lower density of M
   fusca in urban areas, suggesting that the habitat variables influencing
   the physiological condition of M. fusca affected its population density.
   In summary, our results suggest that a substantial proportion of Canyon
   Towhees in the urban area studied have physiological limitations, while
   the Inca Dove seems to have an appropriate physiological response
   despite low values for body condition in urban areas.

TI Regulation of Drosophila Metamorphosis by Xenobiotic Response Regulators
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Mammalian Nrf2-Keap1 and the homologous Drosophila CncC-dKeap1 protein
   complexes regulate both transcriptional responses to xenobiotic
   compounds as well as native cellular and developmental processes. The
   relationships between the functions of these proteins in xenobiotic
   responses and in development were unknown. We investigated the genes
   regulated by CncC and dKeap1 during development and the signal
   transduction pathways that modulate their functions. CncC and dKeap1
   were enriched within the nuclei in many tissues, in contrast to the
   reported cytoplasmic localization of Keap1 and Nrf2 in cultured
   mammalian cells. CncC and dKeap1 occupied ecdysone-regulated early puffs
   on polytene chromosomes. Depletion of either CncC or dKeap1 in salivary
   glands selectively reduced early puff gene transcription. CncC and
   dKeap1 depletion in the prothoracic gland as well as cncC(K6/K6) and
   dKeap1(EY5/EY5) loss of function mutations in embryos reduced
   ecdysone-biosynthetic gene transcription. In contrast, dKeap1 depletion
   and the dKeap1(EY5/EY5) loss of function mutation enhanced xenobiotic
   response gene transcription in larvae and embryos, respectively.
   Depletion of CncC or dKeap1 in the prothoracic gland delayed pupation by
   decreasing larval ecdysteroid levels. CncC depletion suppressed the
   premature pupation and developmental arrest caused by constitutive Ras
   signaling in the prothoracic gland; conversely, constitutive Ras
   signaling altered the loci occupied by CncC on polytene chromosomes and
   activated transcription of genes at these loci. The effects of CncC and
   dKeap1 on both ecdysone-biosynthetic and ecdysone-regulated gene
   transcription, and the roles of CncC in Ras signaling in the prothoracic
   gland, establish the functions of these proteins in the neuroendocrine
   axis that coordinates insect metamorphosis.

TI Expression of TWIST1, Snail, Slug, and NF-kappa B and methylation of the
   TWIST1 promoter in mammary phyllodes tumor
SO TUMOR BIOLOGY
AB TWIST1, Slug, Snail, SIP1, and NF-kappa B are overexpressed in various
   tumors and associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. In this study,
   we examined their potential roles in phyllodes tumor (PT). The
   expression of TWIST1, Snail, Slug, SIP1, and NF-kappa B in benign (n =
   103), borderline (n = 38), and malignant (n = 38) PTs was examined by
   immunostaining. The methylation status of the TWIST1 promoter was
   analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. We detected high expression levels
   of TWIST1 in 47.4 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 31.1 % of benign
   PTs, Slug in 64 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 62.1 % of benign PTs,
   epithelial SIP1 in 75.0 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 86.3 % of
   benign PTs, stromal SIP1 in 35.5 % of borderline/malignant PTs and 22.3
   % of benign PTs, and NF-kappa B in 63.2 % of borderline/malignant PTs
   and 52.4 % of benign PTs. Snail expression was detected in all cases. A
   high expression of TWIST1 (p = 0.026) and TWIST1 promoter methylation (p
   = 0.000) were significantly more frequent in borderline/malignant PTs
   than in benign PTs. Moreover, a high expression of at least four of the
   five antibodies was more commonly observed in borderline/malignant PTs
   than in benign PTs (p = 0.026). However, no relationship was found
   between the expression of TWIST1 or the other proteins examined and the
   clinical outcome. Our results suggest that a high expression of TWIST1
   and related proteins plays a pivotal role in the malignant progression
   of PT.

TI Quantitative Analysis of Histone Modifications: Formaldehyde Is a Source
   of Pathological N(6)-Formyllysine That Is Refractory to Histone
   Deacetylases
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Aberrant protein modifications play an important role in the
   pathophysiology of many human diseases, in terms of both dysfunction of
   physiological modifications and the formation of pathological
   modifications by reaction of proteins with endogenous electrophiles.
   Recent studies have identified a chemical homolog of lysine acetylation,
   N(6)-formyllysine, as an abundant modification of histone and chromatin
   proteins, one possible source of which is the reaction of lysine with
   3'-formylphosphate residues from DNA oxidation. Using a new liquid
   chromatography-coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify
   all N(6)-methyl-, -acetyl-and-formyl-lysine modifications, we now report
   that endogenous formaldehyde is a major source of N(6)-formyllysine and
   that this adduct is widespread among cellular proteins in all
   compartments. N(6)-formyllysine was evenly distributed among different
   classes of histone proteins from human TK6 cells at 1-4 modifications
   per 10(4) lysines, which contrasted strongly with lysine acetylation and
   mono-, di-, and tri-methylation levels of 1.5-380, 5-870, 0-1400, and
   0-390 per 10(4) lysines, respectively. While isotope labeling studies
   revealed that lysine demethylation is not a source of N(6)-formyllysine
   in histones, formaldehyde exposure was observed to cause a
   dose-dependent increase in N(6)-formyllysine, with use of [(13)C,
   (2)H(2)]-formaldehyde revealing unchanged levels of adducts derived from
   endogenous sources. Inhibitors of class I and class II histone
   deacetylases did not affect the levels of N(6)-formyllysine in TK6
   cells, and the class III histone deacetylase, SIRT1, had minimal
   activity (<10%) with a peptide substrate containing the formyl adduct.
   These data suggest that N(6)-formyllysine is refractory to removal by
   histone deacetylases, which supports the idea that this abundant protein
   modification could interfere with normal regulation of gene expression
   if it arises at conserved sites of physiological protein secondary
   modification.

TI Exercise induces age-dependent changes on epigenetic parameters in rat
   hippocampus: A preliminary study
SO EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY
AB Regular exercise improves learning and memory, including during aging
   process. Interestingly, the imbalance of epigenetic mechanisms has been
   linked to age-related cognitive deficits. However, studies about
   epigenetic alterations after exercise during the aging process are rare.
   In this preliminary study we investigated the effect of aging and
   exercise on DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) and H3-K9
   methylation levels in hippocampus from 3 and 20-months aged Wistar rats.
   The animals were submitted to two exercise protocols: single session or
   chronic treadmill protocol. DNMT1 and H3-K9 methylation levels were
   decreased in hippocampus from aged rats. The single exercise session
   decreased both DNMT3b and DNMT1 levels in young adult rats, without any
   effect in the aged group. Both exercise protocols reduced H3-K9
   methylation levels in young adult rats, while the single session
   reversed the changes on H3-K9 methylation levels induced by aging.
   Together, these results suggest that an imbalance on DNMTs and H3-K9
   methylation levels might be linked to the brain aging process and that
   the outcome to exercise seems to vary through lifespan. (c) 2012

TI Interaction of short peptides with FITC-labeled wheat histones and their
   complexes with deoxyribooligonucleotides
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB Judging from fluorescence modulation (quenching), short peptides
   (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly, Glu-Asp-Arg, Ala-Glu-Asp-Leu, Lys-Glu-Asp-Gly,
   Ala-Glu-Asp-Arg, and Lys-Glu-Asp-Trp) bind with FITC-labeled wheat
   histones H1, H2D(2), H3, and H4. This results from the interaction of
   the peptides with the N-terminal histone regions that contain respective
   and seemingly homologous peptide-binding motifs. Because homologous
   amino acid sequences in wheat core histones were not found, the peptides
   seem to bind with some core histone regions having specific
   conformational structure. Peptide binding with histones and
   histone-deoxyribooligonucleotide complexes depends on the nature of the
   histone and the primary structures of the peptides and oligonucleotides;
   thus, it is site specific. Histones H1 bind preferentially with
   single-stranded oligonucleotides by homologous sites in the C-terminal
   region of the protein. Unlike histone H1, the core histones bind
   pre-dominantly with double-stranded methylated oligonucleotides and
   methylated DNA. Stern-Volmer constants of interaction of histone H1 and
   core histones with double-stranded hemimethylated oligonucleotides are
   higher compared with that of binding with unmethylated ones. DNA or
   deoxyribooligonucleotides in a complex with histones can enhance or
   inhibit peptide binding. It is suggested that site-specific interactions
   of short biologically active peptides with histone tails can serve in
   chromatin as control epigenetic mechanisms of regulation of gene
   activity and cellular differentiation.

TI Cell Reprogramming Requires Silencing of a Core Subset of Polycomb
   Targets
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Transcription factor (TF)-induced reprogramming of somatic cells into
   induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is associated with genome-wide
   changes in chromatin modifications. Polycomb-mediated histone H3
   lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) has been proposed as a defining mark
   that distinguishes the somatic from the iPSC epigenome. Here, we
   dissected the functional role of H3K27me3 in TF-induced reprogramming
   through the inactivation of the H3K27 methylase EZH2 at the onset of
   reprogramming. Our results demonstrate that surprisingly the
   establishment of functional iPSC proceeds despite global loss of
   H3K27me3. iPSC lacking EZH2 efficiently silenced the somatic
   transcriptome and differentiated into tissues derived from the three
   germ layers. Remarkably, the genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 in Ezh2
   mutant iPSC cells revealed the retention of this mark on a highly
   selected group of Polycomb targets enriched for developmental regulators
   controlling the expression of lineage specific genes. Erasure of
   H3K27me3 from these targets led to a striking impairment in TF-induced
   reprogramming. These results indicate that PRC2-mediated H3K27
   trimethylation is required on a highly selective core of Polycomb
   targets whose repression enables TF-dependent cell reprogramming.

TI Synergistic and antagonistic actions of acute or chronic social
   stressors and an endotoxin challenge vary over time following the
   challenge
SO BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB Acute stressor exposure and immunogenic challenges can synergistically
   increase behavioral, endocrine and neuroinflammatory responses, but much
   less is known about how chronic stressors influence the actions of
   immune challenges. In the present investigation we assessed the
   influence of bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), administered
   on an acute chronic stressors backdrop, on sickness behavior, changes of
   circulating corticosterone and cytokine levels, and cytokine mRNA
   expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. In this
   regard, it was of particular interest to determine whether the stressors
   would alter the temporal biological effects (onset and normalization) of
   LPS. There was a leftward shift in the temporal curve, in that sickness
   behavior, corticosterone and plasma IL-6 elevations among stressed mice
   appeared sooner after LPS treatment, but 3 h after treatment
   corticosterone and IL-6 were lower than in nonstressed mice. In
   contrast, the stressor, especially when applied chronically, diminished
   the effects of LPS on TNF-alpha over the course of measurement, whereas
   effects on IL-10 were enhanced. In contrast to these peripheral effects,
   central cytokine mRNA expression, especially IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha,
   were diminished 1.5 h following stressor and LPS administration, but
   were then synergistically enhanced at 3 h compared to non-stressed
   controls. Although acute and chronic stressors provoked similar
   behavioral and neuroendocrine responses when combined with LPS, the
   effects of chronic stressors and LPS on brain cytokines were generally
   diminished, particularly in the PFC. The implications of the temporal
   changes related to stressors and immune activation are discussed, and
   several possible mechanisms for these effects are suggested. Crown

   E282-E293, 2013. First published December 4, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00154.2012.-Glucocorticoids are extremely effective
   anti-inflammatory therapies, but their clinical use is limited due to
   severe side effects, including osteoporosis, muscle wasting, fat
   redistribution, and skin thinning. Here we use heavy water labeling and
   mass spectrometry to measure fluxes through metabolic pathways impacted
   by glucocorticoids. We combine these methods with measurements of body
   composition in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-transgenic (Tg)(+)
   mice that have chronically elevated, endogenously produced
   corticosterone and a phenotype that closely mimics Cushing's disease in
   humans. CRH-Tg(+) mice had increased adipose mass, adipose triglyceride
   synthesis, and greatly increased triglyceride/fatty acid cycling in
   subcutaneous and abdominal fat depots and increased de novo lipogenesis
   in the abdominal depot. In bone, CRH-Tg(+) mice had decreased bone mass,
   absolute collagen synthesis rates, and collagen breakdown rate. In skin,
   CRH-Tg(+) mice had decreased skin thickness and absolute collagen
   synthesis rates but no decrease in the collagen breakdown rate. In
   muscle, CRH-Tg(+) mice had decreased muscle mass and absolute protein
   synthesis but no decrease in the protein breakdown rate. We conclude
   that chronic exposure to endogenous glucocorticoid excess in mice is
   associated with ongoing decreases in bone collagen, skin collagen, and
   muscle protein synthesis without compensatory reduction (coupling) of
   breakdown rates in skin and muscle. Both of these actions contribute to
   reduced protein pool sizes. We also conclude that increased cycling
   between triglycerides and free fatty acids occurs in both abdominal and
   subcutaneous fat depots in CRH-Tg(+) mice. CRH-Tg mice have both
   increased lipolysis and increased triglyceride synthesis in adipose
   tissue.

SO CHEMICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Nuclear receptors and their endogenous ligands are involved in key
   biological functions, including development, homeostasis and metabolism,
   and functional molecules that can modulate receptor activities are of
   interest for basic research to elucidate the signaling pathways, as well
   as having potential therapeutic applications. Here, we summarize our
   recent work on the development of nuclear receptor ligands, focusing on
   thyroid hormone receptor (TR) antagonists, fluorescent ligands for
   progesterone receptors (PR), and inhibitors of histone methyltransferase
   (HMT). We have developed a series of potent TR antagonists bearing a
   thiazolidinedione group as a bioisoster of a polar amino acid group.
   Utilizing our library of fluorescent coumarin derivatives, we obtained a
   PR antagonist that exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon binding to PR.
   We also developed a series of HMT inhibitors based on the structure of
   adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a cofactor in the methylation reaction, by
   introducing various alkylamino groups onto the nitrogen atom in place of
   the sulfur atom of AdoMet. Our compounds should be useful in functional
   analysis of these nuclear receptors and investigations of their
   signaling pathways.

TI PICKLE is a CHD subfamily II ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB PICKLE plays a critical role in repression of genes that regulate
   development identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. PICKLE codes for a
   putative ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that exhibits sequence
   similarity to members of subfamily II of animal CHD remodelers, which
   includes remodelers such as CHD3/Mi-2 that also restrict expression of
   developmental regulators. Whereas animal CHD3 remodelers are a component
   of the Mi-2/NuRD complex that promotes histone deacetylation, PICKLE
   promotes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 suggesting that it acts
   via a distinct epigenetic pathway. Here, we examine whether PICKLE is
   also a member of a multisubunit complex and characterize the biochemical
   properties of recombinant PICKLE protein. Phylogenetic analysis
   indicates that PICKLE-related proteins in plants share a common ancestor
   with members of subfamily II of animal CHD remodelers. Biochemical
   characterization of PICKLE in planta, however, reveals that PICKLE
   primarily exists as a monomer. Recombinant PICKLE protein is an ATPase
   that is stimulated by ssDNA and mononucleosomes and binds to both naked
   DNA and mononucleosomes. Furthermore, recombinant PICKLE exhibits
   ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity. These studies demonstrate
   that subfamily II CHD proteins in plants, such as PICKLE, retain
   ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity but act through a mechanism
   that does not involve the ubiquitous Mi-2/NuRD complex. (c) 2012

TI Exclusion of Histiocytes/Endothelial Cells and Using Endothelial Cells
   as Internal Reference Are Crucial for Interpretation of MGMT
   Immunohistochemistry in Glioblastoma
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
AB We evaluated the predictive value of O6-methylguanine-DNA
   methyltransferase (MGMT) protein expression and MGMT promoter
   methylation status in glioblastomas (GBM) treated with temozolomide
   (TMZ) in a Taiwan medical center. Protein expression by
   immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) and MGMT promoter methylation
   detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) were
   performed in a series of 107 newly diagnosed GBMs. We used endothelial
   cells as an internal reference for IHC staining because the staining
   intensities of the MGMT-expressing cells in different specimens varied
   considerably; a positive result was defined as the staining intensity of
   the majority of tumor cells similar to that of the adjacent endothelial
   cells. Immunostainings for microglial/endothelial markers were included
   as part of the MGMT IHC evaluation, and in cases that were difficult to
   interpret, double-labeling helped to clarify the nature of reactive
   cells. The MGMT protein expression was reversely associated with MGMT
   promoter methylation status in 83.7% of cases (MSP(+)/IHC(-) and
   MSP(-)/IHC(+); Pearson r= -0.644, P < 0.001). Twenty-two of 24 (91.7%)
   IHC(+) tumors did not respond to TMZ treatment. Combining MSP and IHC
   results, all the 15 MSP(-)/IHC(+) GBMs were TMZ resistant. The MGMT
   status detected by either IHC or MSP was significantly correlated with
   the TMZ treatment response (both P < 0.001) and survival of GBM patients
   (both P < 0.05).

TI In vitro assessment of thyroid hormone disrupting activities in drinking
   water sources along the Yangtze River
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The thyroid hormone disrupting activities of drinking water sources from
   the lower reaches of Yangtze River were examined using a reporter gene
   assay based on African green monkey kidney fibroblast (CV-1) cells. None
   of the eleven tested samples showed thyroid receptor (TR) agonist
   activity. Nine water samples exhibited TR antagonist activities with the
   equivalents referring to Di-n-butyl phthalate (DNBP) (TR antagonist
   activity equivalents, ATR-EQ(50)s) ranging from 6.92 x 10(1) to 2.85 x
   10(2) mu g DNBP/L. The ATR-EQ(50)s and TR antagonist equivalent ranges
   (ATR-EQ(30-80) ranges) for TR antagonist activities indicated that the
   water sample from site WX-8 posed the greatest health risks. The
   ATR-EQ(80)s of the water samples ranging from 1.56 x 10(3) to 6.14 x
   10(3) pg DNBP/L were higher than the NOEC of DNBP. The results from
   instrumental analysis showed that DNBP might be responsible for the TR
   antagonist activities in these water samples. Water sources along
   Yangtze River had thyroid hormone disrupting potential. (C) 2012

TI Unusual chromatin structure associated with monoparalogous transcription
   of the Babesia bovis ves multigene family
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB Rapid antigenic variation in Babesia bovis involves the variant
   erythrocyte surface antigen-1 (VESA1), a heterodimeric protein with
   subunits encoded by two branches of the ves multigene family. The ves1
   alpha and ves1 beta gene pair encoding VESA1a and 1b, respectively, are
   transcribed in a monoparalogous manner from a single locus of active yes
   transcription (LAT), just one of many quasi-palindromic yes loci. To
   determine whether this organization plays a role in transcriptional
   regulation, chromatin structure was first assessed. Limited treatment of
   isolated nuclei with micrococcal nuclease to assay nucleosomal
   patterning revealed a periodicity of 156-159 bp in both bulk chromatin
   and specific gene coding regions. This pattern also was maintained in
   the intergenic regions (IGr) of non-transcribed yes genes. In contrast,
   the LAT IGr adopts a unique pattern, yielding an apparent cluster of
   five closely-spaced hypersensitive sites flanked by regions of reduced
   nucleosomal occupancy. yes loci fall into three patterns of overall
   sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease or DNase I digestion, with only the
   LAT being consistently very sensitive. Non-transcribed yes genes are
   inconsistent in their sensitivity to the two enzymatic probes.
   Non-linear DNA structure in chromatin was investigated to determine
   whether unique structure arising as a result of the quasi-palindromic
   nature of the LAT may effect transcriptional control. The in vitro
   capacity of yes IGr sequences to adopt stable higher-order DNA structure
   is demonstrated here, but the presence of such structure in vivo was not
   supported. Based upon these results a working model is proposed for the
   chromatin structural remodeling responsible for the sequential
   expression of yes multigene family members from divergently-organized
   loci. (C) 2012 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by

TI Health-related quality of life and disease specific symptoms in
   long-term thyroid cancer survivors: A study from the population-based
   PROFILES registry
SO ACTA ONCOLOGICA
AB Background. Given the longevity of thyroid cancer patients, any
   impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the
   follow-up period is of considerable concern. Therefore, the first aim of
   this study was to assess (thyroid cancer specific) HRQoL among long-term
   thyroid cancer survivors and to compare this with the HRQoL of an
   age-and sex-matched normative population. Secondly, our aim was to
   investigate which clinical and socio-demographic characteristics and
   thyroid cancer specific problems were associated with HRQoL. Material
   and methods. All patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1990 and
   2008, as registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received a survey
   on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) and disease-specific symptoms (THYCA-QoL). The
   scores were compared with age-and sex-matched cancer free controls (n =
   800). A series of multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to
   investigate the independent associations between clinical,
   socio-demographic and thyroid cancer specific factors with HRQoL.
   Results. A total of 306 patients (86%) responded to the invitation.
   Thyroid cancer survivors had significantly lower scores on physical,
   role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning (p < 0.001) compared
   to the normative population after adjusting for comorbidities.
   Sympathetic problems [feeling chilly (52%), hot flushes (40%)],
   neuromuscular problems [cramp legs (43%) and pain joints/muscles (64%)]
   and abrupt attacks of fatigue (50%) were the most often reported thyroid
   cancer specific complaints. Thyroid cancer specific neuromuscular,
   concentration, sympathetic and psychological problems explained 41-58%
   of the variance in HRQoL. Clinical and socio-demographic factors
   explained a small part of the variance in (thyroid cancer specific)
   HRQoL (1-27%). Conclusion. Long-term thyroid cancer survivors experience
   more symptoms and deteriorated HRQoL compared to the normative
   population. Thyroid cancer specific neuromuscular, sympathetic,
   concentration and psychological symptoms are stronger associated with
   HRQoL than clinical and socio-demographic factors alone. Awareness of
   these specific determinants of HRQoL could help health care
   practitioners to provide better supportive care.

TI Reversible RNA adenosine methylation in biological regulation
SO TRENDS IN GENETICS
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a ubiquitous modification in mRNA and
   other RNAs across most eukaryotes. For many years, however, the exact
   functions of m(6)A were not clearly understood. The discovery that the
   fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is an m(6)A demethylase
   indicates that this modification is reversible and dynamically
   regulated, suggesting that it has regulatory roles. In addition, it has
   been shown that m(6)A affects cell fate decisions in yeast and plant
   development. Recent affinity-based m(6)A profiling in mouse and human
   cells further showed that this modification is a widespread mark in
   coding and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts and is likely dynamically
   regulated throughout developmental processes. Therefore, reversible RNA
   methylation, analogous to reversible DNA and histone modifications, may
   affect gene expression and cell fate decisions by modulating multiple
   RNA-related cellular pathways, which potentially provides rapid
   responses to various cellular and environmental signals, including
   energy and nutrient availability in mammals.

TI Ligand binding pocket function of Drosophila USP is necessary for
   metamorphosis
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The widely accepted paradigm that epoxidized methyl farnesoates
   ("juvenile hormones," JHs) are the principal sesquiterpenoid hormones
   regulating insect metamorphosis was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster.
   GC-MS analysis of circulating methyl farnesoids during the mid to late
   3rd instar showed that methyl farnesoate is predominant over methyl
   epoxyfarnesoate (=JH III). The circulating concentration of methyl
   farnesoate (reaching nearly 500 nM), was easily high enough on a kinetic
   basis to load the Drosophila ortholog of the nuclear hormone receptor
   RXR (also known as "ultraspiracle," USP), whereas the circulating
   concentrations of JH III and methyl bisepoxyfarnesoate (bisepoxyJH III)
   were not. The hypothesis that the ligand pocket of USP necessarily binds
   an endogenous ligand for differentiation of the immature to the adult
   was tested with USP mutated at residue that normally extends a side
   chain into the ligand binding pocket. An equilibrium binding assay
   confirmed that the mutation (Q288A) strongly altered methyl farnesoate
   interaction with USP, while a heterologous cell-line transfection assay
   confirmed that the mutation did not allosterically alter the
   transcriptional response of the ultraspiracle/ecdysone receptor
   heterodimer to ecdysteroid signaling. Transgenic wildtype USP driven by
   the cognate natural promoter rescued null animals to develop to the
   adult inside a normally formed puparium, while in contrast animals
   transgenically expressing instead the ligand pocket mutant exhibited
   developmental derangement at the larval to pupal transition, including
   failure to form a properly shaped or sclerotized puparium. Other point
   mutations to the pocket strongly reducing affinity for methyl farnesoate
   similarly disrupted the larval to pupal metamorphosis. These results
   suggest that normal larval to pupal maturation in this mecopteran model
   insect requires the involvement of a distinct endocrine axis of USP
   binding to its own endogenous terpenoid ligand. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI MBD6 is a direct target of Oct4 and controls the stemness and
   differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is a pivotal regulator of cell fate in adult stem
   cells. Its expression is significantly downregulated in late passages of
   cells, concomitant with a prominent increase in Ago2 cytosolic
   localization in single cells. Nuclear localization of Ago2 is crucial
   for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hATSCs (human
   adipose tissue-derived stem cells), mediated by the specific binding of
   the regulatory regions of functional genes, which positively or
   negatively altered gene expression. Ago2 targets genes that control
   stemness, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and microRNA expression,
   all of which are crucial for hATSC survival and self-renewal. Ago2
   promotes cell proliferation and self-renewal by activating the
   expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4). We
   confirmed the direct regulation of Oct4 activity by Ago2, as indicated
   by the results of the ChIP analysis. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 6 (MBD6)
   was detected as an Oct4 regulatory gene. As predicted, knockdown of MBD6
   expression attenuated cell proliferation and eventually induced cell
   death. We hypothesized that MBD6 functions downstream of Oct4 in the
   regulation of stemness-related genes, cell proliferation, self-renewal
   activity, and survival. MBD6 also promoted cell transdifferentiation
   into neural and endodermal beta-cells while significantly attenuating
   differentiation into the mesodermal lineage. We demonstrate that MBD6 is
   regulated by Ago2 via an interaction with Oct4, which alters
   self-renewal and gene expression in hATSCs. MBD6 was promoted cell
   proliferation through a novel set of signal mediators that may influence
   differentiation by repressing MBD2 and MBD3, which are possibly
   recruited by germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF).

TI Global methylation profiling in serous ovarian cancer is indicative for
   distinct aberrant DNA methylation signatures associated with tumor
   aggressiveness and disease progression
SO GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
AB Objective. To To characterize at high resolution the DNA methylation
   changes which occur in the genome of serous epithelial ovarian cancer
   (EOC) in association with tumor aggressiveness.
   Methods. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation in combination with CpG
   island-tiling arrays was used to compare the methylation profiles of
   five borderline, five grade 1/stage III/IV, five grade 3/stage I and
   five grade 3/stage III/IV serous EOC tumors, to those of five normal
   human ovarian tissue samples.
   Results. We found widespread DNA hypermethylation that occurs even in
   low-malignant potential (borderline) tumors and which predominantly
   includes key developmental/homeobox genes. Contrary to DNA
   hypermethylation, significant DNA hypomethylation was observed only in
   grade 3 serous EOC tumors. The latter observation was further confirmed
   when comparing the DNA methylation profiles of primary cell cultures
   derived from matched tumor samples obtained prior to, and following
   chemotherapy treatment from two serous EOC patients with advanced
   disease. To our knowledge this is the first report that has shown the
   presence of massive DNA hypomethylation in advanced serous EOC,
   associated with tumor malignancy and disease progression.
   Conclusions. Our data raise the concern that demethylating drugs that
   are currently being used in advanced EOC disease (representing the
   majority of serous EOC cases) might have adverse effects due to
   activation of oncogenes and prometastatic genes. Understanding the
   relative roles of hypomethylation and hypermethylation in cancer could
   have clear implications on the therapeutic use of agents targeting the
   DNA methylation machinery. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Lack of mutational events of RAS genes in sporadic thyroid cancer but
   high risk associated with HRAS T81C single nucleotide polymorphism
   (case-control study)
SO TUMOR BIOLOGY
AB High incidence of thyroid cancer worldwide indicates the importance of
   studying genetic alterations that lead to its carcinogenesis. Specific
   acquired RAS mutations have been found to predominate in different
   cancers, and HRAS T81C polymorphism has been determined to contribute
   the risk of various cancers, including thyroid cancer. We screened the
   exons 1 and 2 of RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) in 60 consecutive
   thyroid tissue (tumor and adjacent normal) samples, and a case-control
   study was also conducted for HRAS T81C polymorphism in HRAS codon 27
   using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism to test the genotype distribution of 140 thyroid cancer
   patients in comparison with 170 cancer-free controls from a Kashmiri
   population. No mutation was found in any of the thyroid tumor tissue
   samples, but we frequently detected polymorphism at nucleotide 81 (T >
   C) in exon 1 of HRAS gene. In HRAS T81C SNP, frequencies of TT, TC, and
   CC genotypes among cases were 41.4, 38.6, and 20.0 %, while in controls
   genotype frequencies were 84.1, 11.7, and 4.2 %, respectively. A
   significant difference was observed in variant allele frequencies (TC +
   CC) between the cases and controls (58.6 vs. 16 %) with odds ratio =
   7.4; confidence interval (CI) = 4.3-12.7 (P < 0.05). Interestingly,
   combined TC and CC genotype abundantly presented in follicular thyroid
   tumor (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significant association of the variant
   allele (TC + CC) was found with nonsmokers (P < 0.05). This study shows
   that although thyroid cancer is highly prevalent in this region, the
   mutational events for RAS genes do not seem to be involved. Contrary to
   this HRAS T81C SNP of HRAS gene moderately increases thyroid cancer risk
   with rare allele as a predictive marker for follicular tumors.

TI New Technique Using the Snake Retractor for Complete Lymph Node
   Dissection in Robotic Thyroid Surgery: Initial Experiences
SO SURGICAL LAPAROSCOPY ENDOSCOPY & PERCUTANEOUS TECHNIQUES
AB Purpose: We introduce a new technique using a snake retractor to allow
   for a complete central lymph node dissection (CND) under a more optimal
   view for robotic thyroid surgery using bilateral axillo-breast
   approaches.
   Methods: Fifty-eight patients diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer
   who underwent robotic thyroidectomy from April to December 2010 were
   analyzed. A total of 20 patients underwent a robotic surgery without use
   of snake retractor initially, and 38 patients underwent surgery using
   snake retractor. Ipsilateral CNDs were performed in all cases.
   Results: The number of harvested lymph nodes was 5.3 without use of the
   snake retractor and 7.9 with use (P = 0.04). Serum thyro-globulins off
   thyroid hormone in total cases were 0.6 and 0.2, respectively (P =
   0.42). The rate of postoperative complications including transient
   hypocalcemia (n = 8) and transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (n =
   2) were low between the 2 groups without a significance.
   Conclusions: Utilization of the snake retractor facilitated safely
   effective CND with using of 2 arms simultaneously, while providing a
   superior view to that obtained with robotic thyroid surgery using
   bilateral axillo-breast approach.

TI Endosulfan Effects on Rana dalmatina Tadpoles: Quantitative
   Developmental and Behavioural Analysis
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Endosulfan is an organochlorine pesticide that was recently labeled as a
   persistent organic pollutant, but it is still widely employed,
   particularly in developing countries. The goal of this study is to
   evaluate the acute (LC(50)) and chronic effects (developmental and
   behavioural traits) of this insecticide on Rana dalmatina tadpoles after
   exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations (0.005, 0.01, and 0.05
   mg/L) by applying video-tracking techniques to evaluate the quantitative
   effect of endosulfan on amphibian behavioural patterns. The 96 h LC(50)
   value was 0.074 mg endosulfan/L. Tadpoles chronically exposed to 0.01
   and 0.05 mg endosulfan/L underwent high mortality rate, decreased larval
   growth, delayed development, and increased incidence of malformations,
   and they did not reach metamorphosis by the end of the experiment.
   Moreover, tadpoles exposed to these concentrations exhibited several
   abnormalities in swimming patterns, such as shorter distance moved,
   swirling, resting, and unusual use of space. The exposure to 0.005 mg
   endosulfan/L did not cause any significant effects on behaviour, larval
   growth, or development, but we observed a significant decrease in both
   survival and time to metamorphosis. We showed that developmental
   abnormalities are dose-dependent and that the pesticide effects could
   differ depending on the endosulfan concentration and the species tested.
   We also validated the hypothesis that behavioural analysis, along with
   the use of new analytical methods, could be a useful tool in amphibian
   ecotoxicological studies.

TI Genetic Landscape of Open Chromatin in Yeast
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Chromatin regulation underlies a variety of DNA metabolism processes,
   including transcription, recombination, repair, and replication. To
   perform a quantitative genetic analysis of chromatin accessibility, we
   obtained open chromatin profiles across 96 genetically different yeast
   strains by FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory
   elements) assay followed by sequencing. While 5 similar to 10% of open
   chromatin region (OCRs) were significantly affected by variations in
   their underlying DNA sequences, subtelomeric areas as well as gene-rich
   and gene-poor regions displayed high levels of sequence-independent
   variation. We performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using the
   FAIRE signal for each OCR as a quantitative trait. While individual OCRs
   were associated with a handful of specific genetic markers, gene
   expression levels were associated with many regulatory loci. We found
   multi-target trans-loci responsible for a very large number of OCRs,
   which seemed to reflect the widespread influence of certain chromatin
   regulators. Such regulatory hotspots were enriched for known regulatory
   functions, such as recombinational DNA repair, telomere replication, and
   general transcription control. The OCRs associated with these
   multi-target trans-loci coincided with recombination hotspots,
   telomeres, and gene-rich regions according to the function of the
   associated regulators. Our findings provide a global quantitative
   picture of the genetic architecture of chromatin regulation.

   cell death (PCD) during metamorphosis. Prodeath-S/TK is expressed in
   various tissues with a high expression level during molting and
   metamorphosis by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induction. Prodeath-S/TK is
   localized in the larval midgut during metamorphosis. Prodeath-S/TK
   knockdown by injecting dsRNA into larval hemocoel suppresses the
   20E-induced metamorphosis and PCD, as well as downregulates a set of
   genes involved in the PCD and 20E signaling pathway. 20E upregulates
   prodeath-S/TK expression through its nuclear receptor EcR-B1 and USP1.
   Prodeath-S/TK overexpression in the epidermal cell line leads to PCD
   with DNA fragmentation and the activation of caspases 3 and 7.
   Prodeath-S/TK plays role in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal and C-terminal
   sequences of prodeath-S/TK determine its subcellular location. These
   data indicate that prodeath-S/TK participates in PCD by regulating gene
   expression in the 20E signaling pathway.

TI Epigenome-wide association data implicate DNA methylation as an
   intermediary of genetic risk in rheumatoid arthritis
SO NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Epigenetic mechanisms integrate genetic and environmental causes of
   disease, but comprehensive genome-wide analyses of epigenetic
   modifications have not yet demonstrated robust association with common
   diseases. Using II lumina HumanMethylation450 arrays on 354
   anti-citrullinated protein antibody-associated rheumatoid arthritis
   cases and 337 controls, we identified two clusters within the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) region whose differential methylation
   potentially mediates genetic risk for rheumatoid arthritis. To reduce
   confounding factors that have hampered previous epigenome-wide studies,
   we corrected for cellular heterogeneity by estimating and adjusting for
   cell-type proportions in our blood-derived DNA samples and used
   mediation analysis to filter out associations likely to be a consequence
   of disease. Four CpGs also showed an association between genotype and
   variance of methylation. The associations for both clusters replicated
   at least one CpG (P < 0.01), with the rest showing suggestive
   association, in monocyte cell fractions in an independent cohort of 12
   cases and 12 controls. Thus, DNA methylation is a potential mediator of
   genetic risk.

TI Global demethylation in loss of imprinting subtype of wilms tumor
SO GENES CHROMOSOMES & CANCER
AB Epigenetic abnormalities at the IGF2/H19 locus play a key role in the
   onset of Wilms tumor. These tumors can be classified into three
   molecular subtypes depending on the events occurring at this locus: loss
   of imprinting (LOI), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or retention of
   imprinting (ROI). As IGF2 LOI is a consequence of aberrant methylation,
   we hypothesized that this subtype of Wilms tumors might display global
   abnormalities of methylation. We therefore analyzed the methylation
   status of satellite DNA, as a surrogate for global methylation in 50
   Wilms tumor patients. Satellite methylation was quantified by a
   methylation-sensitive quantitative PCR. We confirmed hypomethylation of
   both satellite a (Sat a) and satellite 2 (Sat 2) DNA in Wilms tumor
   samples compared with normal kidney. In addition, we found that LOI
   tumors, unlike ROI or LOH ones, showed concordant hypomethylation of
   both Sat a and Sat 2 DNA. This would suggest that the LOI subtype of
   Wilms tumor, which unlike other subtypes results from an epimutation,
   has a global deregulation of methylation mechanisms. (c) 2012 Wiley

TI Increased resistance of immobilized-stressed mice to infection: with
   behavioral alterations
SO BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB Immobilization is an easy and convenient method to induce both
   psychological and physical stress resulting in restricted motility and
   aggression and is believed to be the most severe type of stress in
   rodent models. Although it has been generally accepted that chronic
   stress often results in immunosuppression while acute stress has been
   shown to enhance immune responses, the effects of IS on the host
   resistance to Escherichia coil (E. coil) infection and associated
   behavioral changes are still not clear. In a series of experiments aimed
   at determining the level of hypothalamic COX-2, HSP-90, HSP-70, SOD-1
   and plasma level of corticosterone, cytokine, antibody titer and their
   association with behavioral activities, mice were infected with viable
   E. coli during acute and chronic IS by taping their paws. In this study
   we show that acute and chronic IS enhances the resistance of mice to E.
   coil infection via inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines, free radicals, and by improving the exploratory behavior.
   Altogether, our findings support the notion that cytokines released
   during immune activation and under the influence of corticosterone can
   modulate the open field behavior both in terms of locomotor activity as
   well as exploration. One of the features observed with chronic stressor
   was a lower ability to resist bacterial infection, although in case of
   acute stress, a better clearance of bacterial infection was observed in
   vivo with improvement of exploratory behavior and cognitive functions.

TI Do not put all teleosts in one net: Focus on the sox2 and pou2 genes
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR
   BIOLOGY
AB The Pou2 and Sox2 proteins are major transcription factors for
   development and cell differentiation. In teleosts, the expression
   patterns of pou2 or sox2 are different between species from distant
   families, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.
   In this study, we assessed the divergences among teleosts, including
   within closely related species. The pou2 and sox2 gene expression
   patterns were characterised over several developmental stages in a
   cyprinid model, i.e., the goldfish, and the potential regulation sites
   of these genes within teleost conserved regions were localised. During
   embryonic development, differences in the expression patterns between
   the goldfish and other teleosts, including zebrafish, were observed for
   both genes. The in silico analysis of the 5' flanking regions of the
   pou2 gene showed high conservation within teleosts, whereas the sox2
   sequence diverged in tetraodontiforms. Certain putative cis regulatory
   elements were common to all teleosts, whereas others were found only in
   cyprinids. The analysis of the DNA methylation patterns of the pou2 and
   sox2 upstream sequences revealed that the studied CpG sites remained
   hypomethylated at all stages of embryo development in both genes. In
   contrast, in the adult fin, the studied CpG sites were hypermethylated
   in pou2 but not in sox2, suggesting the existence of
   methylation-sensitive regions in pou2. Overall, although most
   similarities at the level of the gene regulatory sites were found within
   cyprinids, the expression pattern of pou2 or sox2 during development
   differs between cyprinids species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Lung cancer with loss of BRG1/BRM, shows epithelial mesenchymal
   transition phenotype and distinct histologic and genetic features
SO CANCER SCIENCE
AB BRG1 and BRM, two core catalytic subunits in SWI/SNF chromatin
   remodeling complexes, have been suggested as tumor suppressors, yet
   their roles in carcinogenesis are unclear. Here, we present evidence
   that loss of BRG1 and BRM is involved in the progression of lung
   adenocarcinomas. Analysis of 15 lung cancer cell lines indicated that
   BRG1 mutations correlated with loss of BRG1 expression and that loss of
   BRG1 and BRM expression was frequent in E-cadherin-low and vimentin-high
   cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of 93 primary lung
   adenocarcinomas showed loss of BRG1 and BRM in 11 (12%) and 16 (17%)
   cases, respectively. Loss of expression of BRG1 and BRM was frequent in
   solid predominant adenocarcinomas and tumors with low thyroid
   transcription factor-1 (TTF-1, master regulator of lung) and low
   cytokeratin7 and E-cadherin (two markers for bronchial epithelial
   differentiation). Loss of BRG1 was correlated with the absence of
   lepidic growth patterns and was mutually exclusive of epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. In contrast, loss of BRM was found
   concomitant with lepidic growth patterns and EGFR mutations. Finally, we
   analyzed the publicly available dataset of 442 cases and found that loss
   of BRG1 and BRM was frequent in E-cadherin-low, TTF-1-low, and
   vimentin-high cases and correlated with poor prognosis. We conclude that
   loss of either or both BRG1 and BRM is involved in the progression of
   lung adenocarcinoma into solid predominant tumors with features of
   epithelial mesenchymal transition and loss of the bronchial epithelial
   phenotype. BRG1 loss was specifically involved in the progression of
   EGFR wild-type, but not EGFR-mutant tumors.

TI Wilson's Disease: Changes in Methionine Metabolism and Inflammation
   Affect Global DNA Methylation in Early Liver Disease
SO HEPATOLOGY
AB Hepatic methionine metabolism may play an essential role in regulating
   methylation status and liver injury in Wilson's disease (WD) through the
   inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) by copper (Cu) and
   the consequent accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We studied
   the transcript levels of selected genes related to liver injury, levels
   of SAHH, SAH, DNA methyltransferases genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b), and
   global DNA methylation in the tx-j mouse (tx-j), an animal model of WD.
   Findings were compared to those in control C3H mice, and in response to
   Cu chelation by penicillamine (PCA) and dietary supplementation of the
   methyl donor betaine to modulate inflammatory and methylation status.
   Transcript levels of selected genes related to endoplasmic reticulum
   stress, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation were down-regulated at
   baseline in tx-j mice, further down-regulated in response to PCA, and
   showed little to no response to betaine. Hepatic Sahh transcript and
   protein levels were reduced in tx-j mice with consequent increase of SAH
   levels. Hepatic Cu accumulation was associated with inflammation, as
   indicated by histopathology and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase
   (ALT) and liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) levels. Dnmt3b
   was downregulated in tx-j mice together with global DNA hypomethylation.
   PCA treatment of tx-j mice reduced Tnf-a and ALT levels, betaine
   treatment increased S-adenosylmethionine and up-regulated Dnmt3b levels,
   and both treatments restored global DNA methylation levels. Conclusion:
   Reduced hepatic Sahh expression was associated with increased liver SAH
   levels in the tx-j model of WD, with consequent global DNA
   hypomethylation. Increased global DNA methylation was achieved by
   reducing inflammation by Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We
   propose that increased SAH levels and inflammation affect widespread
   epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD. (HEPATOLOGY

TI The Histone Methyltransferase Inhibitor BIX01294 Enhances the Cardiac
   Potential of Bone Marrow Cells
SO STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Bone marrow (BM) has long been considered a potential stem cell source
   for cardiac repair due to its abundance and accessibility. Although
   previous investigations have generated cardiomyocytes from BM, yields
   have been low, and far less than produced from ES or induced pluripotent
   stem cells (iPSCs). Since differentiation of pluripotent cells is
   difficult to control, we investigated whether BM cardiac competency
   could be enhanced without making cells pluripotent. From screens of
   various molecules that have been shown to assist iPSC production or
   maintain the ES cell phenotype, we identified the G9a histone
   methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294 as a potential reprogramming agent
   for converting BM cells to a cardiac-competent phenotype. BM cells
   exposed to BIX01294 displayed significantly elevated expression of
   brachyury, Mesp1, and islet1, which are genes associated with embryonic
   cardiac progenitors. In contrast, BIX01294 treatment minimally affected
   ectodermal, endodermal, and pluripotency gene expression by BM cells.
   Expression of cardiac-associated genes Nkx2.5, GATA4, Hand1, Hand2,
   Tbx5, myocardin, and titin was enhanced 114, 76, 276, 46, 635, 123, and
   5-fold in response to the cardiogenic stimulator Wnt11 when BM cells
   were pretreated with BIX01294. Immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated
   that BIX01294 exposure allowed for the subsequent display of various
   muscle proteins within the cells. The effect of BIX01294 on the BM cell
   phenotype and differentiation potential corresponded to an overall
   decrease in methylation of histone H3 at lysine9, which is the primary
   target of G9a histone methyltransferase. In summary, these data suggest
   that BIX01294 inhibition of chromatin methylation reprograms BM cells to
   a cardiac-competent progenitor phenotype.

TI Changes to DNA methylation and homologous recombination frequency in the

SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY-BIOCHIMIE ET BIOLOGIE CELLULAIRE
AB Plants undergo changes in response to biotic and abiotic stresses that
   help them adjust and survive. Some of these changes may even be passed
   on to progeny and eventually lead to adaptive evolution.
   Transgenerational changes in response to stress include alterations in
   DNA methylation and changes in homologous recombination frequency (HRF).
   The progeny of plants that were stressed often show elevated HRF as well
   as genomic hypermethylation, although specific loci that are beneficial
   in times of stress may be hypomethylated. One of the possible mechanisms
   responsible for passing the memory to the progeny involves small
   interfering RNAs; Dicer-like proteins, DCL2 and DCL3, are in part
   required for this process. However, while epigenetic modifications are
   often present in the untreated progeny of stressed plants, they are not
   usually sustained for multiple unexposed generations. Still,
   transgenerational inheritance of such changes has already begun to
   provide evidence for an important role of epigenetics in enhancing
   stress resistance.

TI Genetic and epigenetic alterations of steroidogenic factor-1 in ovarian
   tumors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), the product of the NR5A1 gene, is an
   essential transcription factor that is known to regulate steroidogenesis
   in ovarian epithelia, including the synthesis of progesterone, a
   suppressor of ovarian cancer. Expression of the SF-1 protein, a
   potential ovarian tumor suppressor, has been demonstrated in normal OSE
   cells, but is lost in most ovarian tumors and ovarian tumor cell lines.
   We examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and promoter methylation as
   potential mechanisms that may explain the loss of SF-1 protein in
   ovarian tumor tissues. Genotyping of three NR5A1 SNPs in matched
   tumor/normal tissues identified LOH in 16/36 (44%) of the ovarian tumors
   successfully analyzed, and somatic mutations (gain of allele) in 10% of
   the tumors. Furthermore, a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme
   method was used to demonstrate statistically significant (p<0.0001)
   increase in the frequency of NR5A1 gene methylation in ovarian tumors
   (36/46; 78%) versus normal ovaries (1/11; 9%). These data suggest that
   the SF-1 encoding gene exhibits frequent genetic (LOH/base substitution)
   and epigenetic (methylation) somatic alterations in ovarian tumors.
   These data also present novel molecular mechanisms that may explain the
   loss of SF-1 protein in ovarian tumors, and its potential role in
   ovarian carcinogenesis.

TI Angiotensin II Impairs Glucose Utilization in Obese Zucker Rats by
   Increasing HPA Activity via an Adrenal-dependent Mechanism
SO HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH
AB Angiotensin II (AngII) increases the activity of the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We have previously
   demonstrated in obese Zucker rats (OZR) that AngII-induced HPA
   hyper-reactivity was associated with impaired glucose utilization. The
   aim of this study was to specify the potential role of the adrenals in
   regulating AngII-dependent glucose homeostasis in obesity.
   Adrenal-specific AngII effects were determined regarding 1) the HPA axis
   by ACTH tests after treating OZR with AngII (9 mu g/h, s.c.) for 3
   months and 2) glucose utilization by oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT)
   in OZR that were adrenalectomized (adx) or sham operated and treated for
   1 month with AngII (9 mu g/h, s.c.). AngII increased the corticosterone
   response after ACTH infusions, clearly indicating the key role of the
   adrenals for mediating stress reactions. Baseline levels of glucose and
   corticosterone were not altered by AngII treatment or by adrenalectomy.
   In contrast, AngII similarly reduced baseline insulin in sham and
   adxOZR. During OGTT, AngII increased glucose and corticosterone
   responses in shamOZR, whereas insulin was slightly diminished. This
   reaction pattern was lost when obese Zucker rats were adrenalectomized.
   In summary, we verified our hypothesis that the adrenal glands play a
   key role in worsening glucose homeostasis in obesity in response to
   AngII, which further supports recent findings that improvement in
   glucose utilization after AT(1) blockade is related to reduced activity
   of the HPA axis.

TI Supplementation with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A

   histone hyperacetylation and increases gene expression levels. The aim
   of the present study was to establish a suitable condition for the use
   of TSA in in vitro cultures of bovine embryos, and to determine whether

   evaluation of embryo quality based on the following parameters:
   apoptosis, total cell number and blastocyst hatching. TSA promoted
   embryonic arrest and degeneration at concentrations of 15, 25 and 50 nM.
   All treated groups presented lower blastocyst rates. Exposure of embryos
   to 5 nM for 144 h and to 15 nM for 48 h decreased blastocyst hatching.
   However, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
   nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL) assay revealed similar apoptosis rates
   and total cell numbers in all groups studied. Although, in the present
   study, TSA treatment did not improve the parameters studied, the results
   provided background information on TSA supplementation during in vitro
   culture of bovine embryos and showed that embryo quality was apparently
   not affected, despite a decrease in blastocyst rate after exposure to
   TSA.

TI Complexity reduction of chromatin architecture in macula densa cells
   during mouse postnatal development
SO NEPHROLOGY
AB Aim To determine whether complexity of chromatin structure in kidney
   macula densa cells (MDC) decreases during postnatal development in mice.
   Methods The levels of chromatin structural complexity were measured by
   determining fractal dimension of MDC nuclei. Kidney tissue was obtained
   from the total of 32 male Swiss albino mice divided into four age groups
   (n?=?8): newborn (0 days), 10 days old, 20 days old and 30 days old. For
   a total of 640 MDC chromatin structures, fractal dimension, lacunarity,
   as well as parameters of Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture
   were determined. Results Chromatin fractal dimension in animals aged 10
   days, 20 days and 30 days was significantly lower (P?<?0.05, P?<?0.01
   and P?<?0.001, respectively), compared with newborn mice. This
   complexity reduction of chromatin architecture is in accordance with
   previously published studies, which detected generalized and sustained
   loss of both tissue and cell complexity during aging. The loss of
   complexity was texture-independent, since there was no statistically
   significant difference (P?>?0.05) in both chromatin angular second
   moment and inverse difference moment between the age groups. Conclusion
   Our results indicate that age-related nuclear intrinsic factors which do
   not influence chromatin texture may have an important role in MDC
   postnatal development.

TI Factors That Influence Radioactive Iodine Use for Thyroid Cancer
SO THYROID
AB Background: There is variation in the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) as
   treatment for well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The factors involved
   in physician decision-making for RAI remain unknown.
   Methods: We surveyed physicians involved in postsurgical management of
   patients with thyroid cancer from 251 hospitals. Respondents were asked
   to rate the factors important in influencing whether a thyroid cancer
   patient receives RAI. Multivariable analyses controlling for physician
   age, gender, specialty, case volume, and whether they personally
   administer RAI, were performed to determine correlates of importance
   placed on patients' and physicians' worry about death from cancer and
   differences between low- versus higher-case-volume physicians.
   Results: The survey response rate was 63% (534/853). Extent of disease,
   adequacy of surgical resection, patients' willingness to receive RAI,
   and patients' age were the factors physicians were most likely to report
   as quite or very important in influencing recommendations for RAI to
   patients with thyroid cancer. Interestingly, both physicians' and
   patients' worry about death from thyroid cancer were also important in
   determining RAI use. Physicians with less thyroid cancer cases per year
   were more likely than higher-volume physicians to report patients' (p <
   0.001) and physicians' worry about death (p = 0.016) as quite or very
   important in decision-making. Other factors more likely to be of greater
   importance in determining RAI use for physicians with lower thyroid
   cancer patient volume versus higher include the accepted standard at the
   affiliated hospital (p = 0.020), beliefs about RAI expressed by
   colleagues comanaging patients (p = 0.003), and patient distance from
   the nearest facility administering RAI (p = 0.012).
   Conclusion: In addition to the extent of disease and adequacy of
   surgical resection, physicians place importance on physician and patient
   worry about death from thyroid cancer when deciding whether to treat a
   patient with RAI. The factors important to physician decision-making
   differ based on physician thyroid-cancer case-volume, with worry about
   death being more influential for low-case-volume physicians. As the
   mortality from thyroid cancer is low, the importance placed on death in
   decision making may be unwarranted.

TI Thyroid Cancer in Thyroglossal Duct Cysts Requires a Specific Approach
   due to Its Unpredictable Extension
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in thyroglossal duct cysts
   is uncommon. The requirement of total thyroidectomy and lymph node
   dissection is still controversial.
   Setting: The study was performed in a referral thyroid cancer center at
   an academic hospital.
   Patients: We conducted a single center retrospective study of a
   consecutive series of 26 patients with DTC in thyroglossal duct cyst,
   all having undergone cyst resection and total thyroidectomy.
   Main Outcome Measures: Diagnostic modalities, surgical treatment,
   histopathological features, and clinical outcome were included in the
   study.
   Results: Thyroglossal duct cyst cancer histotype was papillary in 23 of
   26 patients (88.5%) and follicular-Hurthle in 3 of 26 cases (11.5%). A
   concomitant papillary DTC in the thyroid gland was found in 16 of 26
   cases (61.5%), and it was multifocal in 8 of 16 cases (50%). At
   presentation, the patients with cancer in both the thyroglossal duct
   cyst and the thyroid were older than the patients who only had cancer in
   the thyroglossal duct cyst (44.9 +/- 7.6 vs 32.0 +/- 12.7; P = .006).
   Lymph node dissection, performed in 17 of 26 patients (65.4%), indicated
   that the central compartment was involved in 6 patients (35.3%, all
   having cancer also in the thyroid), the laterocervical compartments in
   10 patients (58.8%), and the submental in 4 (23.5%). Six patients
   (23.1%) had persistent disease at 6-year median follow-up.
   Conclusions: DTC in thyroglossal duct cysts occurs at a younger age and
   with more aggressive features at presentation. Concomitant cancer in the
   thyroid and lymph node metastases is present in most cases. Lymph node
   compartment involvement is different from that of cancers in the thyroid
   gland. Therefore, surgical treatment should include both thyroglossal
   duct cyst resection and total thyroidectomy, with individualized
   surgical nodal dissection. Subsequent management should follow current
   DTC guidelines. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 458-465, 2013)

TI A Meta-Analysis of Thyroid-Related Traits Reveals Novel Loci and
   Gender-Specific Differences in the Regulation of Thyroid Function
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Thyroid hormone is essential for normal metabolism and development, and
   overt abnormalities in thyroid function lead to common endocrine
   disorders affecting approximately 10% of individuals over their life
   span. In addition, even mild alterations in thyroid function are
   associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and
   psychiatric disorders. To identify novel variants underlying thyroid
   function, we performed a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association
   studies for serum levels of the highly heritable thyroid function
   markers TSH and FT4, in up to 26,420 and 17,520 euthyroid subjects,
   respectively. Here we report 26 independent associations, including
   several novel loci for TSH (PDE10A, VEGFA, IGFBP5, NFIA, SOX9, PRDM11,
   FGF7, INSR, ABO, MIR1179, NRG1, MBIP, ITPK1, SASH1, GLIS3) and FT4
   (LHX3, FOXE1, AADAT, NETO1/FBXO15, LPCAT2/CAPNS2). Notably, only limited
   overlap was detected between TSH and FT4 associated signals, in spite of
   the feedback regulation of their circulating levels by the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Five of the reported loci (PDE8B,
   PDE10A, MAF/LOC440389, NETO1/FBXO15, and LPCAT2/CAPNS2) show strong
   gender-specific differences, which offer clues for the known sexual
   dimorphism in thyroid function and related pathologies. Importantly, the
   TSH-associated loci contribute not only to variation within the normal
   range, but also to TSH values outside the reference range, suggesting
   that they may be involved in thyroid dysfunction. Overall, our findings
   explain, respectively, 5.64% and 2.30% of total TSH and FT4 trait
   variance, and they improve the current knowledge of the regulation of
   hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function and the consequences of
   genetic variation for hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

TI Post-implantation mortality of in vitro produced embryos is associated
   with DNA methyltransferase 1 dysfunction in sheep placenta
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB Is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) dysfunction involved in epigenetic
   deregulation of placentae from embryos obtained by assisted reproduction
   technologies (ARTs)?
   DNMT1 expression in growing placentae of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos
   is compromised and associated with pregnancy loss.
   DNMT1 maintains the methylation profile of genes during cell division.
   The methylation status of genes involved in placenta development is
   altered in embryos obtained in vitro. Disturbances in the epigenetic
   regulation of gene expression during placentogenesis could be involved
   in the frequent developmental arrest and loss of IVP embryos.
   Forty sheep were naturally mated (Group 1, CTR). IVP blastocysts (24 per
   ewe) were surgically transferred to the remaining 46 recipient sheep 6
   days after oestrus (Group 2). Twenty-one recipients from Group 1 and 27
   recipients from Group 2 were allowed to deliver in order to compare
   embryo survival in both groups at term (150 days). From the remaining
   recipients (n 38), fetuses and placentae of both groups were recovered
   by paramedian laparotomy at Days 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28 of gestation.
   Immediately after collection, early placental tissues
   (chorion-allantois) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and DNMT1
   expression and activity was evaluated. mRNA levels (for DNMT1, HDAC2,
   PCNA, DMAP1, MEST, IGF2, CDKN1C, H19) and the methylation status of H19
   were also analyzed. Furthermore, embryo size and survival rate were
   measured.
   Our study shows that DNMT1 expression was reduced in early placentae
   from sheep IVP embryos. This reduction was associated with growth arrest
   and subsequent death of the sheep embryos. Conversely, normal levels of
   DNMT1 and its cofactors were observed in placentae from IVP embryos that
   survived this developmental bottleneck. Although DNA methylation
   machinery was severely compromised in IVP placentae only up to Day 24,
   the low DNMT1 enzymatic activity that persisted after this stage in IVP
   placentae was not lethal for the developing embryos.
   The studied genes represent only a small fraction of genes regulating
   DNA methylation. Further studies are needed to evaluate changes in the
   expression and methylation status of other genes that may lead to
   developmental arrest of IVP embryos. As this is the only study
   evaluating the functionality of DNMT1 machinery in placentae from ART
   embryos, studies on other species are needed to confirm if our
   observation may be applicable to all mammalian embryos produced in
   vitro.
   The knowledge about compromised activity of DNMT1 in placentae obtained
   from IVP embryos should stimulate detailed studies on the metabolic
   requirements of oocytes and embryos in order to adequately enrich the
   culture media.

TI Differentiated thyroid carcinoma in a girl with resistance to thyroid
   hormone management with triiodothyroacetic acid
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is characterized by a reduced target
   tissue response to the action of thyroid hormone, which leads to high
   levels of free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine with non-suppressed
   levels of thyrotropin (TSH). Recently, three cases of papillary thyroid
   carcinoma associated with thyroid hormone resistance syndrome were
   published. The main challenge in this situation is the difficulty of
   maintaining the suppression of TSH levels without producing symptoms of
   hyperthyroidism. We present another case of an association of thyroid
   hormone resistance syndrome and papillary thyroid carcinoma, and we
   share our experience with 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid, which made
   possible an easier management of the carcinoma after surgery,
   maintaining the TSH levels suppressed despite the resistance to thyroid
   hormones.

TI The methylation of C/EBP beta gene promoter and regulated by GATA-2
   protein
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Mammalian genomes are punctuated by DNA sequences containing an
   atypically high frequency of CpG sites (CpG islands; CGIs) that are
   associated with the majority of annotated gene promoters. Methylated C
   bases of CpG sites inhibit the expression of downstream genes. During
   the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding
   protein (C/EBP) beta gene plays an important role. We studied the CpG
   island methylation status of the C/EBP beta promoter and its
   relationship with the GATA-2 protein. We used computer analysis to
   determine that the C/EBP beta promoter sequence is rich in CGIs, and
   observed that two of seven methylated C bases were demethylated during
   the preadipocyte differentiation using bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP).
   This corresponded with the onset of notable C/EBP beta gene expression.
   Immunofluorescence and molecular docking showed that the GATA-2 protein
   binds the C/EBP beta promoter in front of the first demethylated CpG
   site. We also found that expression of GATA-2 and C/EBP beta proteins is
   negatively correlated. These results indicate that the methylated C
   bases in the C/EBP beta promoter relate to expression of the C/EBP beta
   gene, and that its demethylation is linked with GATA-2 protein
   association.

TI Effect of capsid confinement on the chromatin organization of the SV40
   minichromosome
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we determined the three-dimensional
   packing architecture of the minichromosome confined within the SV40
   virus. In solution, the minichromosome, composed of closed circular
   dsDNA complexed in nucleosomes, was shown to be structurally similar to
   cellular chromatin. In contrast, we find a unique organization of the
   nanometrically encapsidated chromatin, whereby minichromosomal density
   is somewhat higher at the center of the capsid and decreases towards the
   walls. This organization is in excellent agreement with a coarse-grained
   computer model, accounting for tethered nucleosomal interactions under
   viral capsid confinement. With analogy to confined liquid crystals, but
   contrary to the solenoid structure of cellular chromatin, our
   simulations indicate that the nucleosomes within the capsid lack
   orientational order. Nucleosomes in the layer adjacent to the capsid
   wall, however, align with the boundary, thereby inducing a 'molten
   droplet' state of the chromatin. These findings indicate that
   nucleosomal interactions suffice to predict the genome organization in
   polyomavirus capsids and underscore the adaptable nature of the
   eukaryotic chromatin architecture to nanoscale confinement.

TI Association between genomic alterations and metastatic behavior of
   colorectal cancer identified by array-based comparative genomic
   hybridization
SO GENES CHROMOSOMES & CANCER
AB Colorectal cancers (CRCs) exhibit multiple genetic alterations,
   including allelic imbalances (copy number alterations, CNAs) at various
   chromosomal loci. In addition to genetic aberrations, DNA methylation
   also plays important roles in the development of CRC. To better
   understand the clinical relevance of these genetic and epigenetic
   abnormalities in CRC, we performed an integrative analysis of copy
   number changes on a genome-wide scale and assessed mutations of TP53,
   KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA and DNA methylation of six marker genes in single
   glands isolated from 39 primary tumors. Array-based comparative genomic
   hybridization (array-CGH) analysis revealed that genomic losses commonly
   occurred at 3q26.1, 4q13.2, 6q21.32, 7q34, 8p12-23.3, 15qcen and 18,
   while gains were commonly found at 1q21.3-23.1, 7p22.3-q34,
   13q12.11-14.11, and 20. The total numbers and lengths of the CNAs were
   significantly associated with the aberrant DNA methylation and Dukes'
   stages. Moreover, hierarchical clustering analysis of the array-CGH data
   suggested that tumors could be categorized into four subgroups. Tumors
   with frequent DNA methylation were most strongly enriched in subgroups
   with infrequent CNAs. Importantly, Dukes' D tumors were enriched in the
   subgroup showing the greatest genomic losses, whereas Dukes' C tumors
   were enriched in the subgroup with the greatest genomic gains. Our data
   suggest an inverse relationship between chromosomal instability and
   aberrant methylation and a positive association between genomic losses
   and distant metastasis and between genomic gains and lymph node
   metastasis in CRC. Therefore, DNA copy number profiles may be predictive
   of the metastatic behavior of CRCs. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Decreased cortical muscarinic M1 receptors in schizophrenia are
   associated with changes in gene promoter methylation, mRNA and gene
   targeting microRNA
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Many studies have shown decreased cortical muscarinic M1 receptors
   (CHRM1) in schizophrenia (Sz), with one study showing Sz can be
   separated into two populations based on a marked loss of CHRM1 (similar
   to 75%) in similar to 25% of people (Def-Sz) with the disorder. To
   better understand the mechanism contributing to the loss of CHRM1 in
   Def-Sz, we measured specific markers of gene expression in the cortex of
   people with Sz as a whole, people differentiated into Def-Sz and people
   with Sz that do not have a deficit in cortical CHRM1 (Non-Def-Sz) and
   health controls. We now report that cortical CHRM1 gene promoter
   methylation and CHRM1 mRNA are decrease in Sz, Def-Sz and Non-Def-Sz but
   levels of the micro RNA (miR)-107, a CHRM1 targeting miR, are increased
   only in Def-Sz. We also report in vitro data strongly supporting the
   notion that miR-107 levels regulate CHRM1 expression. These data suggest
   there is a reversal of the expected inverse relationship between gene
   promoter methylation and CHRM1 mRNA in people with Sz and that a
   breakdown in gene promoter methylation control of CHRM1 expression is
   contributing to the global pathophysiology of the syndrome. In addition,
   our data argues that increased levels of at least one miR, miR-107, is
   contributing to the marked loss of cortical CHRM1 in Def-Sz and this may
   be a differentiating pathophysiology. These latter data continue to
   support the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNA) have a role in the
   underlying neurobiology of Sz but argue they are differentially affected
   in subsets of people within that syndrome. Translational Psychiatry

TI Post-translational modifications in activation and inhibition of
   oct-1-DNA binding complex in H2B and other diverse gene regulation:
   Prediction of interplay sites
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Octamer DNA binding transcription factors play important roles in
   housekeeping and specific gene regulations. Octamer DNA binding
   transcription factor-1 (Oct-1), expressed ubiquitously, is a
   multifunctional molecule. The binding sites of Oct-1 are the promoters
   of H2B gene and the genes of snRNA, U2, U6, and 7SK, yet Oct-1 has been
   described as constitutively expressed transcription factor regulating
   the expression of housekeeping genes. Diverse tissue-specific genes
   regulations by Oct-1 include genes for interleukins (IL) 2, 3, 5; the
   granulocyte-macrophagal colony-stimulating factor, immunoglobulins a,
   beta, Ly9; the endocrine-associated Pit-1 gene; the genes for
   gonadoliberin, prolactin, the thyroid transcription factor, and
   thyrotropin. The most interesting aspect of the gene regulations of
   Oct-1 includes both activation and inhibition of transcription. These
   opposite regulations of Oct-1 have been described through
   presence/absence of a post-translational modification (PTM) in its
   different domains. We propose a mechanism of interplay of different PTMs
   or presence/absence of PTMs in the different domains of Oct-1. We also
   suggest that the absence of phosphorylation and acetylation in G1 and S
   phases of the cell cycle is associated with interplay of methylation and
   O-GlcNAc modification. This interplay of O-GlcNAc modification with the
   phosphorylation and methylation with acetylation in POU sub-domain of
   Oct-1 may facilitate the formation of Oct-1DNA complex, consequently
   activating H2B gene transcription. Whereas, in G2 and M phases these
   sites are occupied by phosphate resulting in inhibition of Oct-1DNA
   complex formation leading to the suppression of H2B gene transcription.

   December 13, 2012; doi: 10.1152/ajpgi.00369.2012.-Smooth muscle cell
   cultures are used frequently to investigate the cellular mechanisms of
   contraction. We tested the hypothesis that cell culture alters the
   expression of select cell-signaling proteins of excitation-contraction
   coupling in colon smooth muscle cells without altering the contractile
   phenotype. We used muscularis externa (ME) tissues, freshly dispersed
   cells (FC), primary cell cultures (PC), and resuspensions of cell
   cultures (RC). Colon smooth muscle cells retained their phenotype in all
   states. We investigated expression of 10 cell-signaling proteins of
   excitation-contraction coupling in all four types of tissue. Expression
   of all these proteins did not differ between ME and FC (P > 0.05).
   However, expression of the alpha(1C)-subunit of Ca(v)1.2b, myosin light
   chain kinase, myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, and 17-kDa C
   kinase-potentiated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor (CPI-17) decreased in
   PC and RC vs. ME and FC (all P < 0.05). Expression of G alpha(i3),
   serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 beta-catalytic subunit, and Rho
   kinase 1 increased in PC and RC vs. ME and FC (all P < 0.05). Cell
   culture and resuspension downregulated expression of alpha-actin and
   calponin, but not myosin heavy chain. The net effect of these molecular
   changes was suppression of cell reactivity to ACh in RC vs. FC.
   Overexpression of CPI-17 in PC partially reversed the suppression of
   contractility in resuspended cells. Methylation-specific PCR showed
   increased methylation of the Cpi-17 gene promoter in PC vs. ME (P <
   0.05). We concluded that smooth muscle cells retain their contractile
   phenotype in culture. However, reactivity to ACh declines because of
   altered expression of specific cell-signaling proteins involved in
   excitation-contraction coupling. DNA methylation of the Cpi-17 promoter
   may contribute to its gene suppression.

TI PUB-NChIP-"in vivo biotinylation" approach to study chromatin in
   proximity to a protein of interest
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB We have developed an approach termed PUB-NChIP (proximity utilizing
   biotinylation with native ChIP) to purify and study the protein
   composition of chromatin in proximity to a nuclear protein of interest.
   It is based on coexpression of (1) a protein of interest, fused with the
   bacterial biotin ligase BirA, together with (2) a histone fused to a
   biotin acceptor peptide (BAP), which is specifically biotinylated by
   BirA-fusion in the proximity of the protein of interest. Using the RAD18
   protein as a model, we demonstrate that the RAD18-proximal chromatin is
   enriched in some H4 acetylated species. Moreover, the RAD18-proximal
   chromatin containing a replacement histone H2AZ has a different pattern
   of H4 acetylation. Finally, biotin pulse-chase experiments show that the
   H4 acetylation pattern starts to resemble the acetylation pattern of
   total H4 after the proximity of chromatin to RAD18 has been lost.

TI Membrane lipids and nuclear DNA are differently susceptive to Fenton
   reaction substrates in porcine thyroid
SO TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO
AB Fenton reaction (Fe(2+) + H(2)O(2) -> Fe(3+) + center dot OH + OH(-)) is
   of special significance in the thyroid, as both substrates are
   indispensable for thyroid hormone synthesis, therefore being available
   presumably at high concentrations under physiological conditions.
   The study aimed at evaluation if both Fenton reaction substrates are
   required to induce oxidative damage to membrane lipids and nuclear DNA
   in porcine thyroid homogenates, and if these macromolecules are
   vulnerable to the same extent.
   Thyroid homogenates and nuclear DNA were incubated in the presence of
   H(2)O(2) and/or Fe(2+). Malondi-aldehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals (MDA +
   4-HDA) concentration (lipid peroxidation index) was measured
   spectrophotometrically, and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine
   (8-oxodG) concentration (DNA damage index) by HPLC.
   Whereas Fenton reaction substrates, used separately, did not affect
   lipid peroxidation, they increased 8-oxodG level for the highest
   H(2)O(2) concentration (100 mM) and in Fe(2+) concentration-dependent
   manner (300, 150, 30 and 15 mu M).
   If Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) were applied together, lipid peroxidation
   increased significantly, however without H(2)O(2) concentration- but
   with clear Fe(2+) concentration-dependent effect. Concerning DNA damage,
   Fe(2+) enhanced H(2)O(2) effect, whereas Fe(2+) concentration-dependent
   effect was not changed by H(2)O(2).
   Excess of exclusively one of Fenton reaction substrates is sufficient to
   induce oxidative DNA damage, but not lipid peroxidation, in porcine
   thyroid. Comparing to H(2)O(2), Fe(2+) seems to be a stronger damaging
   substrate. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhanced bioactivity of silybin B methylation products
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Flavonolignans from milk thistle (Silybum marianum) have been
   investigated for their cellular modulatory properties, including cancer
   chemoprevention and hepatoprotection, as an extract (silymarin), as
   partially purified mixtures (silibinin and isosilibinin), and as pure
   compounds (a series of seven isomers). One challenge with the use of
   these compounds in vivo is their relatively short half-life due to
   conjugation, particularly glucuronidation. In an attempt to generate
   analogues with improved in vivo properties, particularly reduced
   metabolic liability, a semi-synthetic series was prepared in which the
   hydroxy groups of silybin B were alkylated. A total of five methylated
   analogues of silybin B were synthesized using standard alkylation
   conditions (dimethyl sulfate and potassium carbonate in acetone),
   purified using preparative HPLC, and elucidated via spectroscopy and
   spectrometry. Of the five, one was monomethylated (3), one was
   dimethylated (4), two were trimethylated (2 and 6), and one was
   tetramethylated (5). The relative potency of all compounds was
   determined in a 72 h growth-inhibition assay against a panel of three
   prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP) and a human
   hepatoma cell line (Huh7.5.1) and compared to natural silybin B.
   Compounds also were evaluated for inhibition of both cytochrome P450 2C9
   (CYP2C9) activity in human liver microsomes and hepatitis C virus
   infection in Huh7.5.1 cells. The monomethyl and dimethyl analogues were
   shown to have enhanced activity in terms of cytotoxicity, CYP2C9
   inhibitory potency, and antiviral activity (up to 6-fold increased
   potency) compared to the parent compound, silybin B. In total, these
   data suggested that methylation of flavonolignans can increase
   bioactivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs) on MDS-derived cell
   lines
SO EXPERIMENTAL HEMATOLOGY
AB DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), including decitabine (DAC)
   and azacitidine (AZA), have recently been highlighted for the treatment
   of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however, their action
   mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we investigated the
   effects of DNMTIs on MDS-derived cell lines in vitro. An MDS-derived
   cell line MDS92 and its blastic subline MDS-L and HL-60 were used. All
   three cell lines were sensitive to DNMTIs, but MDS-L was the most
   susceptible. DAC-induced cell death in MDS-L was preceded by DNA damage
   induced G2 arrest via a p53-independent pathway. AZA did not influence
   the pattern of cell cycle, although it induced DNA damage response. The
   IC(50) of DAC or AZA on MDS-L cells was associated with the dose
   inducing the maximal hypomethylation in long interspersed nuclear
   elements-1 (LINE-1) methylation assay. AZA suppressed the level of
   methylation in a time-dependent manner (days 4, 7, and 10), whereas DAC
   maintained the level of methylation from day 4 to 11. The protein
   expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a decreased with the suppression of growth
   and methylation. We conclude that this study provides in vitro models
   for understanding the effects of DNMTIs on cell growth and gene
   regulation, including differences in the possible action mechanism of
   DAC and AZA. (C) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

TI SHANK3 as an autism spectrum disorder-associated gene
SO BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT
AB SHANK3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein enriched in the postsynaptic
   density of excitatory synapses, and plays important roles in the
   formation, maturation, and maintenance of synapses. Haploinsufficiency
   of the SHANK3 gene causes a developmental disorder, 22q13.3 deletion
   syndrome (known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome), that is characterized by
   severe expressive language and speech delay, hypotonia, global
   developmental delay, and autistic behavior. Since several SHANK3
   mutations have been identified in a particular phenotypic group in
   patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the SHANK3 is strongly
   suspected of being involved in the pathogenesis and neuropathology of
   ASD. Five CpG-islands have been identified in the SHANK3 gene, and
   tissue-specific expression of SHANK3 is regulated by DNA methylation in
   an epigenetic manner. Cumulative evidence has shown that several SHANK3
   variants are expressed in the developing rodent brain and that their
   expression is regulated by DNA methylation of intragenic promoters. We
   identified novel SHANK3 transcripts whose transcription started at the
   vicinity of the CpG-island 2 in the mouse brain. Shank3 mutant mice
   exhibit autistic-like behaviors, including impaired social interaction
   and repetitive behaviors. In this article we review recent findings in
   regard to higher brain functions of SHANK3, epigenetic regulation of
   SHANK3 expression, and SHANK3-related ASD that were obtained from
   genetic analyses in ASD patients, molecular biological studies using
   developing mouse brains, and studies of Shank3 mutant mice. (C) 2012 The

TI Chromatin structure of two genomic sites for targeted transgene
   integration in induced pluripotent stem cells and hematopoietic stem
   cells
SO GENE THERAPY
AB Achieving transgene integration into preselected genomic sites is
   currently one of the central tasks in stem cell gene therapy. A strategy
   to mediate such targeted integration involves site-specific
   endonucleases. Two genomic sites within the MBS85 and chemokine (C-C
   motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) genes (AAVS1 and CCR5 zinc-finger nuclease
   (CCR5-ZFN) sites, respectively) have recently been suggested as
   potential target regions for integration as their disruption has no
   functional consequence. We hypothesized that efficient transgene
   integration maybe affected by DNA accessibility of endonucleases and
   therefore studied the transcriptional and chromatin status of the AAVS1
   and CCR5 sites in eight human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines
   and pooled CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Matrix chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that the CCR5 site and
   surrounding regions possessed a predominantly closed chromatin
   configuration consistent with its transcriptional inactivity in these
   cell types. In contrast, the AAVS1 site was located within a
   transcriptionally active region and exhibited an open chromatin
   configuration in both iPS cells and HSCs. To show that the AAVS1 site is
   readily amendable to genome modification, we expressed Rep78, an
   AAV2-derived protein with AAVS1-specific endonuclease activity, in iPS
   cells after adenoviral gene transfer. We showed that Rep78 efficiently
   associated with the AAVS1 site and triggered genonne modifications
   within this site. On the other hand, binding to and modification of the
   CCR5-ZFN site by a ZFN was relatively inefficient. Our data suggest a
   critical influence of chromatin structure on efficacy of site-specific
   endonucleases used for genome editing. Gene Therapy (2013) 20, 201-214;

AB Remarkable progress has been made in the last decade in new methods for
   biologic measurements using sophisticated technologies that go beyond
   the established genome, proteome, and gene expression platforms. These
   methods and technologies create opportunities to enhance cancer
   epidemiologic studies. In this article, we describe several emerging
   technologies and evaluate their potential in epidemiologic studies. We
   review the background, assays, methods, and challenges and offer
   examples of the use of mitochondrial DNA and copy number assessments,
   epigenomic profiling (including methylation, histone modification,
   miRNAs, and chromatin condensation), metabolite profiling
   (metabolomics), and telomere measurements. We map the volume of
   literature referring to each one of these measurement tools and the
   extent to which efforts have been made at knowledge integration (e.g.,
   systematic reviews and meta-analyses). We also clarify strengths and
   weaknesses of the existing platforms and the range of type of samples
   that can be tested with each of them. These measurement tools can be
   used in identifying at-risk populations and providing novel markers of
   survival and treatment response. Rigorous analytic and validation

TI 5-aza-2 '-Deoxycytidine Enhances the Radiosensitivity of Breast Cancer
   Cells
SO CANCER BIOTHERAPY AND RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS
AB Purpose: To investigate the effect of the DNA methyltransferase
   inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), on radiosensitivity in breast
   cancer cells. Materials and methods: Two breast cancer cell lines,
   MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, were evaluated. The methylation status and
   the mRNA expression of three genes (ER, PR, and HIC-1) that were
   frequently hypermethylated in these cell lines were determined as a
   function of DAC exposure.
   3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo-(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT)
   absorbance and a colony-forming assay were used to estimate cell
   viability and radiosensitivity. Using cell-cycle analysis, gamma-histone
   H2A (gamma-H2AX) formation assays and methylation-specific polymerase
   chain reaction (MSP) analysis of three genes correlated with
   radiosensitivity (BRCA1, 14-3-3 sigma, and E-cadherin), the mechanism of
   DAC enhancement of radiosensitivity was explored. Results: DAC induced
   the demethylation and reactivation of silent genes in both cell lines.
   The combination of DAC and irradiation induced growth suppression in
   vitro. DAC, 5 mu M, enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation. DAC
   followed by irradiation correlated with G2/M arrest and the retardation
   of repair of radiation-induced double strand breaks. DAC reversed the
   methylation status of genes connected with radiosensitization. The
   different radiosensitization effects observed with different breast
   cancers cells may correlate with the primary methylation status of
   radiosensitizing genes. Conclusions: Treatment strategies that include
   DAC present promising options for sensitizing breast cancer cells to
   irradiation.

AB Aim: The BRCA1 promoter is hypermethylated in ovarian cancer patients.
   We postulated that this hypermethylation might be involved in ovarian

   Western blot was performed to assay the expression of BRCA1 protein.
   Results: BRCA1 showed hypomethylation in 30 normal ovarian and 30 benign
   ovarian tumors, but showed hypermethylation or methylation in ovarian
   cancer patients. There was also a significant difference in the BRCA1
   promoter methylation levels between different ovarian cancer stages.
   Compared to stage I and the control groups, there were higher BRCA1
   promoter methylation frequencies in stage II and III ovarian cancers.
   BRCA1 methylation correlated with the loss of BRCA1 expression. BRCA1
   promoter in stage I tumors showed hypomethylated. Conclusion: Promoter
   hypermethylation may act as a biomarker for sporadic ovarian cancer
   progression, but is unlikely to be helpful in the early diagnosis of
   ovarian cancer.

TI The Relationship Between Long-Range Chromatin Occupancy and
   Polymerization of the Drosophila ETS Family Transcriptional Repressor
   Yan
SO GENETICS
AB ETS family transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved downstream
   effectors of Ras/MAPK signaling with critical roles in development and
   cancer. In Drosophila, the ETS repressor Yan regulates cell
   proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues; however, the
   mechanisms of Yan-mediated repression are not well understood and only a
   few direct target genes have been identified. Yan, like its human
   ortholog TEL1, self-associates through an N-terminal sterile alpha-motif
   (SAM), leading to speculation that Yan/TEL1 polymers may spread along
   chromatin to form large repressive domains. To test this hypothesis, we
   created a monomeric form of Yan by recombineering a point mutation that
   blocks SAM-mediated self-association into the yan genomic locus and
   compared its genome-wide chromatin occupancy profile to that of
   endogenous wild-type Yan. Consistent with the spreading model
   predictions, wild-type Yan-bound regions span multiple kilobases.
   Extended occupancy patterns appear most prominent at genes encoding
   crucial developmental regulators and signaling molecules and are highly
   conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis, suggesting
   functional relevance. Surprisingly, although occupancy is reduced, the
   Yan monomer still makes extensive multikilobase contacts with chromatin,
   with an overall pattern similar to that of wild-type Yan. Despite its
   near-normal chromatin recruitment, the repressive function of the Yan
   monomer is significantly impaired, as evidenced by elevated target gene
   expression and failure to rescue a yan null mutation. Together our data
   argue that SAM-mediated polymerization contributes to the functional
   output of the active Yan repressive complexes that assemble across
   extended stretches of chromatin, but does not directly mediate
   recruitment to DNA or chromatin spreading.

TI miR-101 is down-regulated by the hepatitis B virus x protein and induces
   aberrant DNA methylation by targeting DNA methyltransferase 3A
SO CELLULAR SIGNALLING
AB The hepatitis B virus x (HBx) protein has been implicated in HBV-related
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. However, whether HBx
   regulates miRNA expression that plays important roles in gene regulation
   during hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. The expression of
   microRNA-101 (miR-101) in HBV-related HCC tissues and HCC cells was
   evaluated by real-time PCR. The direct target of miR-101, DNA
   methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), was identified in silico and validated
   using a 3'-UTR reporter assay. miR-101 was functionally characterized in
   cells with transiently altered miR-101 expression. HBx expression was
   found to have a significant inverse correlation with miR-101 expression
   in HBx-expressing HepG2 compared to control HepG2 cells. miR-101
   expression was frequently down-regulated in HBV-related HCC tissues
   compared to adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues and had a significant
   inverse correlation with DNMT3A expression in HBV-related HCCs. Further
   characterization of miR-101 revealed that it negatively regulated DNA
   methylation partly through targeting DNMT3A. HBx-mediated miR-101
   down-regulation and DNMT3A up-regulation supported the enhanced DNA
   methylation of several tumor-suppressor genes in HBx-expressing cells.
   Our studies demonstrating the deregulation of miR-101 expression by HBx
   may provide novel mechanistic insights into HBV-mediated
   hepatocarcinogenesis and identify a potential miRNA-based targeted

TI Adaptive Changes in Basal and Stress-Induced HPA Activity in Lactating
   and Post-Lactating Female Rats
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Lactation represents a period of marked adaptation of the
   hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis. We characterized basal and
   stress-induced HPA activity during lactation and experimental weaning
   using dynamic blood sampling in rats. Pulsatile and diurnal
   corticosterone release occurred at all reproductive stages studied
   (virgin; day 10 of lactation; 3 and 14 days after experimental weaning
   on day 10 of lactation). However, in lactating rats the diurnal peak was
   significantly reduced, resulting in a flattened rhythm, and three days
   after weaning, basal HPA activity was markedly suppressed: the number of
   pulses and underlying basal levels of corticosterone were reduced and
   the diurnal rise phase delayed. Marked changes in the HPA response to 10
   min noise stress also occurred at these times: being completely absent
   in lactating animals, but restored and highly prolonged in early weaned
   animals. Injection of methylprednisolone (2 mg, iv) was used to
   determine whether changes in fast glucocorticoid suppression correlated
   with these adaptive changes. Methylprednisolone induced a rapid
   suppression of corticosterone in virgin animals, but this effect was
   markedly attenuated in lactating and early weaned animals and was
   accompanied by significant changes in relative expression of hippocampal
   glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA. All effects were
   reversed or partially reversed 14 days after experimental weaning. Thus,
   the presence of the pups has an important influence on regulation of the
   HPA axis, and while postpartum adaptations are reversible, acute weaning
   evokes marked reorganisation of basal and stress-induced HPA activity.

TI Postpartum Corticosterone Administration Reduces Dendritic Complexity
   and Increases the Density of Mushroom Spines of Hippocampal CA3 Arbours
   in Dams
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 15% of mothers after
   giving birth. A complete understanding of depression during the
   postpartum period has yet to be established, although disruptions in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and stress during the postpartum may
   be involved. To model these components in rats, we administered high
   corticosterone (CORT) postpartum, which increases immobility in the
   forced swim test (FST), and reduces maternal care, body weight and
   hippocampal cell proliferation in dams. The hippocampus is altered in
   response to chronic stress, exposure to high glucocorticoids and in
   major depression in humans. In the present study, we examined whether
   high CORT reduced dendritic complexity and spines in the CA3 region of
   the hippocampus. Additionally, housing complexity was manipulated so
   that dams and litters were housed either with tubes (complex) or without
   tubes (impoverished) to investigate the consequences of new animal care
   regulations. Dams received 40 mg/kg/day of CORT or oil starting on day 2
   postpartum for 23 days. Maternal behaviours were assessed on postpartum
   days 28 and dams were tested using the FST on days 21 and 22. Dams were
   killed on day 24 and brains were processed for Golgi impregnation.
   Pyramidal cells in the CA3 subfield were traced using a camera lucida
   and analysed for branch points and dendritic complexity, as well as
   spine density and type on both basal and apical arbours. As previously
   established, high CORT postpartum reduced maternal care and increased
   immobility in the FST, which is a measure of depressive-like behaviour.
   High CORT postpartum reduced the complexity of basal arbours and
   increased mushroom spines on both apical and basal dendrites. Housing
   complexity had no effect on spines of CA3 pyramidal cells but modest
   effects on cell morphology. These data show that chronic high CORT in
   postpartum females alters hippocampal morphology and may provide insight
   regarding the neurobiological consequences of high stress or CORT during
   the postpartum period, as well as be relevant for postpartum stress or
   depression.

TI Genetic and epigenetic alterations are involved in the regulation of
   TPM1 in cholangiocarcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from biliary
   epithelial cells. The tumor suppressor gene tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) is
   downregulated in several human cancer types; however, its expression
   status in cholangiocarcinoma is still unknown. We elucidated TPM1
   expression and its regulation mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma. Real-time
   (RT)-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed
   to examine TPM1 expression levels in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and
   tumor tissues. Cell lines were treated with lentiviral vector containing
   the miR-21 knockdown and inhibitors of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms
   (manumycin A, LY294002, U0126, DAC and TSA), and the TPM1 expression
   change was observed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Cell
   proliferation, apoptosis and migration were evaluated by water-soluble
   tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay, flow cytometry and wound healing
   experiments, respectively. TPM1 was downregulated in the intrahepatic
   cholangiocarcinoma cells (HuCCT1) and upregulated in the extrahepatic
   cholangiocarcinoma cells (QBC939) compared with normal intrahepatic
   biliary epithelial cells (HIBEC). TPM1 stained negative in the
   intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues, as revealed by
   immunohistochemistry, although there was no significant difference in
   staining of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues and adjacent
   non-cancer tissues. RAS and two important downstream signaling pathways
   (RAS/PI3K/AKT and RAS/MEK/ERK) were involved in TPM1 regulation and
   inhibition of the epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone
   deacetylation and miR-21 upregulation upregulated TPM1 expression.
   Inhibitors of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (manumycin A, LY294002,
   U0126, DAC and TSA) inhibited cell proliferation and migration and
   induced apoptosis. These data indicated that TPM1 is downregulated in
   HuCCT1 cells and that the Ras signaling pathway as well as DNA
   methylation, histone deacetylation and miR-21 upregulation play
   important roles in the suppression of TPM1 expression in HuCCT1 cells.
   Thus, compounds that inhibit genetic and epigenetic mechanisms may be
   promising agents in treating cholangiocarcinoma.

TI Epigenetic Deregulation of MicroRNAs: New Opportunities to Target
   Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers with a
   worldwide increasing trend of incidence, representing the third largest
   cause of cancer-related death. The initiation and progression of HCC
   depend on progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic defects
   that alter an array of signaling cascades via deregulation of signal
   activators and inhibitors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules
   that post-transcriptionally repress gene expression including those
   signal molecules and thus are critical for many cellular pathways.
   However, the balance of this fine-tuning function is broken by the
   abnormal expression of miRNAs in various cancers through genomic
   alterations or epigenetic mechanisms. This review summarizes the current
   knowledge of the role of epigenetic aberrations, including histone
   methylation and deacetylation as well as DNA hypermethylation and
   hypomethylation in the aberrant regulation of miRNAs leading to
   activation of signaling pathways such as Ras, STAT3 and AKT/mTOR in HCC.
   Conceivably, the therapeutic efficacy of current chromatin-modifying
   drugs might be related to their capacity to reactivate previously
   silenced tumor-suppressive miRNAs and cause down-regulation of target
   oncogenes. Better understanding of the epigenetics-miRNA regulatory
   cascades in the control of the functionally significant pathways will
   provide new opportunities for the development of more effective
   therapeutic modality for HCC.

TI Aire's plant homeodomain(PHD)-2 is critical for induction of
   immunological tolerance
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Aire impacts immunological tolerance by regulating the expression of a
   large set of genes in thymic medullary epithelial cells, thereby
   controlling the repertoire of self-antigens encountered by
   differentiating thymocytes. Both humans and mice lacking Aire develop
   multiorgan autoimmunity. Currently, there are few molecular details on
   how Aire performs this crucial function. The more amino-terminal of its
   two plant homeodomains (PHDs), PHD1, helps Aire target poorly
   transcribed loci by "reading" the methylation status of a particular
   lysine residue of histone-3, a process that does not depend on the more
   carboxyl-terminal PHD-2. This study addresses the role of PHD2 in Aire
   function by comparing the behavior of wild-type and PHD2-deleted Aire in
   both transfected cells and transgenic mice. PHD2 was required for Aire
   to interact with sets of protein partners involved in chromatin
   structure/binding or transcription but not with those implicated in
   pre-mRNA processing; it also was not required for Aire's nuclear
   translocation or regional distribution. PHD2 strongly influenced the
   ability of Aire to regulate the medullary epithelial cell transcriptome
   and so was crucial for effective central tolerance induction. Thus,
   Aire's two PHDs seem to play distinct roles in the scenario by which it
   assures immunological tolerance.

TI Cdx2 expression and its promoter methylation during
   metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in Barrett's esophagus
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: To examine how the expression of caudal type homebox transcription
   factor 2 (Cdx2) is regulated in the development of malignancy in
   Barrett's esophagus.
   METHODS: Cdx2, mucin (MUC) series (MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6), p53 and
   E-cadherin expression in Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma
   specimens were examined by immunostaining. Isolated clusters of cells
   from (1) MUC2 and Cdx2-positive intestinal metaplastic mucosa; (2)
   MUC5AC and MUC6-positive, and MUC2 and Cdx2-negative high-grade
   dysplasia (HD), or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMC); and (3) MUC5AC,
   MUC6 and Cdx2-positive poorly-differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma
   (PDA) were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction
   using sets of primers for detecting methylation status of the Cdx2 gene.
   RESULTS: Most of the non-neoplastic Barrett's esophageal mucosa showing
   intestinal-type metaplasia with or without low-grade dysplasia was
   positive for E-cadherin, MUC series and Cdx2, but negative for p53. A
   portion of the low-grade to HD was positive for E-cadherin, MUC5AC, MUC6
   and p53, but negative for MUC2 and Cdx2. The definite IMC area was
   strongly positive for MUC5AC, MUC6 and p53, but negative for MUC2 and
   Cdx2. Methylation of the Cdx2 promoter was not observed in intestinal
   metaplasia, while hypermethylation of part of its promoter was observed
   in hot dipped and IMC. Hypermethylation of a large fraction of the Cdx2
   promoter was observed in PDA.
   CONCLUSION: Cdx2 expression is restored irrespective of the methylation
   status of its promoter. Apparent positive immunohistochemical results
   can be a molecular mark for gene silencing memory. (C) 2013 Baishideng.

TI The silence of MUC2 mRNA induced by promoter hypermethylation associated
   with HBV in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO BMC MEDICAL GENETICS
AB Background: To evaluate the promoter methylation status of MUC2 gene and
   mRNA expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Methods: We analyzed MUC2 methylation by MSP, and MUC2 mRNA by real-time
   PCR in 74 HCC.
   Results: MUC2 mRNA were lower in HCC tissues (Mean (-Delta Ct) = -4.70)
   than that in Non-HCC tissues (Mean (-Delta Ct) = -2.98). Expression of
   MUC2 was elevated in only 23 (31.08%) of the 74 HCC patients. MUC2
   promoter was hypermethylated in 62.2% (46/74) of HCCs, and in only 18.9%
   (14/74) of non-tumor samples. MUC2 mRNA were lower in HCC patients with
   hypermethylation (Mean (-Delta Delta Ct) = -2.25) than those with
   demethylation (Mean (-Delta Delta Ct) = -0.22), and there is a decreased
   tendency for MUC2 mRNA in HCC patients with promoter hypermethylation (p
   = 0.011). There was a significantly correlation found between MUC2 mRNA
   and HBV and AFP in HCC. The loss of MUC2 mRNA and hypermethylation could
   be poor prognostic factors. After treated by 5-Aza-CdR and TSA, we found
   that MUC2 mRNA induced significantly in 7721, Huh7 and HepG2 cells.
   Conclusion: The results suggested that MUC2 mRNA silenced by promoter
   hypermethylation is associated with high levels HBV in HCC.

TI Genome-wide Methylation Profiles Reveal Quantitative Views of Human
   Aging Rates
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB The ability to measure human aging from molecular profiles has practical
   implications in many fields, including disease prevention and treatment,
   forensics, and extension of life. Although chronological age has been
   linked to changes in DNA methylation, the methylome has not yet been
   used to measure and compare human aging rates. Here, we build a
   quantitative model of aging using measurements at more than 450,000 CpG
   markers from the whole blood of 656 human individuals, aged 19 to 101.
   This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages,
   which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. We also show
   that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are
   reflected in the transcriptome. Moreover, we show how our aging model is
   upheld in other human tissues and reveals an advanced aging rate in
   tumor tissue. Our model highlights specific components of the aging
   process and provides a quantitative readout for studying the role of
   methylation in age-related disease.

TI Effects of orally applied butyrate bolus on histone acetylation and
   cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in the liver of chicken - a randomized
   controlled trial
SO NUTRITION & METABOLISM
AB Background: Butyrate is known as histone deacetylase inhibitor, inducing
   histone hyperacetylation in vitro and playing a predominant role in the
   epigenetic regulation of gene expression and cell function. We
   hypothesized that butyrate, endogenously produced by intestinal
   microbial fermentation or applied as a nutritional supplement, might
   cause similar in vivo modifications in the chromatin structure of the
   hepatocytes, influencing the expression of certain genes and therefore
   modifying the activity of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing
   cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
   Methods: An animal study was carried out in chicken as a model to
   investigate the molecular mechanisms of butyrate's epigenetic actions in
   the liver. Broiler chicks in the early post-hatch period were treated
   once daily with orally administered bolus of butyrate following
   overnight starvation with two different doses (0.25 or 1.25 g/kg body
   weight per day) for five days. After slaughtering, cell nucleus and
   microsomal fractions were separated by differential centrifugation from
   the livers. Histones were isolated from cell nuclei and acetylation of
   hepatic core histones was screened by western blotting. The activity of
   CYP2H and CYP3A37, enzymes involved in biotransformation in chicken, was
   detected by aminopyrine N-demethylation and aniline-hydroxylation assays
   from the microsomal suspensions.
   Results: Orally added butyrate, applied in bolus, had a remarkable
   impact on nucleosome structure of hepatocytes: independently of the
   dose, butyrate caused hyperacetylation of histone H2A, but no changes
   were monitored in the acetylation state of H2B. Intensive
   hyperacetylation of H3 was induced by the higher administered dose,
   while the lower dose tended to increase acetylation ratio of H4. In
   spite of the observed modification in histone acetylation, no
   significant changes were observed in the hepatic microsomal CYP2H and
   CYP3A37 activity.
   Conclusion: Orally added butyrate in bolus could cause in vivo
   hyperacetylation of the hepatic core histones, providing modifications
   in the epigenetic regulation of cell function. However, these changes
   did not result in alteration of drug-metabolizing hepatic CYP2H and
   CYP3A37 enzymes, so there might be no relevant pharmacoepigenetic
   influences of oral application of butyrate under physiological
   conditions.

TI Epigenetic silencing of microRNA-193a contributes to leukemogenesis in
   t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia by activating the PTEN/PI3K signal
   pathway
SO BLOOD
AB t(8;21) is one of the most frequent chromosomal translocations occurring
   in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is considered the
   leukemia-initiating event. The biologic and clinical significance of
   microRNA dysregulation associated with AML1/ETO expressed in t(8; 21)
   AML is unknown. Here, we show that AML1/ETO triggers the heterochromatic
   silencing of microRNA-193a (miR-193a) by binding at AML1-binding sites
   and recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Suppression of miR-193a
   expands the oncogenic activity of the fusion protein AML-ETO, because
   miR-193a represses the expression of multiple target genes, such as
   AML1/ETO, DNMT3a, HDAC3, KIT, CCND1, and MDM2 directly, and increases
   PTEN indirectly. Enhanced miR-193a levels induce G(1) arrest, apoptosis,
   and restore leukemic cell differentiation. Our study identifies miR-193a
   and PTEN as targets for AML1/ETO and provides evidence that links the
   epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes miR-193a and PTEN to
   differentiation block of myeloid precursors. Our results indicated a
   feedback circuitry involving miR-193a and AML1/ETO/DNMTs/HDACs,
   cooperating with the PTEN/PI3K signaling pathway and contributing to
   leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo, which can be successfully targeted
   by pharmacologic disruption of the AML1/ETO/DNMTs/HDACs complex or
   enhancement of miR-193a in t(8;21)-leukemias. (Blood.

TI Individual variation in glucocorticoid stress responses in animals
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB When stimuli from the environment are perceived to be a threat or
   potential threat then animals initiate stress responses, with activation
   of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and secretion of
   glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol and corticosterone). Whilst standard
   deviation or standard error values are always reported, it is only when
   graphs of individual responses are shown that the extensive variation
   between animals is apparent. Some animals have little or no response to
   a stressor that evokes a relatively large response in others.
   Glucocorticoid responses of fish, amphibian, reptiles, birds, and
   mammals are considered in this review. Comparisons of responses between
   animals and groups of animals focused on responses to restraint or
   confinement as relatively standard stressors. Individual graphs could
   not be found in the literature for glucocorticoid responses to capture
   or restraint in fish or reptiles, with just one graph in mammals with
   the first sample was collected when animals were initially restrained.
   Coefficients of variation (CVs) calculated for parameters of
   glucocorticoid stress responses showed that the relative magnitudes of
   variation were similar in different vertebrate groups. The overall mean
   CV for glucocorticoid concentrations in initial (0 min) samples was
   74.5%, and CVs for samples collected over various times up to 4 h were
   consistently between 50% and 60%. The factors that lead to the observed
   individual variation and the extent to which this variation is adaptive
   or non-adaptive are little known in most animals, and future studies of
   glucocorticoid responses in animals can focus on individual responses
   and their origins and significance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Loss of LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) suppresses growth and
   alters gene expression of human colon cancer cells in a p53- and DNMT1
   (DNA methyltransferase 1)-independent manner
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Epigenetic silencing of gene expression is important in cancer. Aberrant
   DNA CpG island hypermethylation and histone modifications are involved
   in the aberrant silencing of tumour-suppressor genes. LSD1
   (lysine-specific demethylase 1) is a H3K4 (histone H3 Lys(4))
   demethylase associated with gene repression and is overexpressed in
   multiple cancer types. LSD1 has also been implicated in targeting p53
   and DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), with data suggesting that the
   demethylating activity of LSD1 on these proteins is necessary for their
   stabilization. To examine the role of LSD1 we generated LSD1
   heterozygous (LSD1(+/-)) and homozygous (LSD1(-/-)) knockouts in the
   human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. The deletion of LSD1 led to a
   reduced cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, the
   knockout of LSD1 in HCT116 cells did not result in global increases in
   its histone substrate H3K4me2 (dimethyl-H3K4) or changes in the
   stability or function of p53 or DNMT1. However, there was a significant
   difference in gene expression between cells containing LSD1 and those
   null for LSD1. The results of the present study suggested that LSD1 is
   critical in the regulation of cell proliferation, but also indicated
   that LSD1 is not an absolute requirement for the stabilization of either
   p53 or DNMT1.

TI Effects of early life stress on brain activity: Implications from
   maternal separation model in rodents
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Adverse experiences in early life can affect the formation of neuronal
   circuits during postnatal development and exert long-lasting influences
   on neural function. Many studies have shown that daily repeated maternal
   separation (RMS), an animal model of early life stress, can modulate the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and can affect subsequent
   brain function and emotional behavior during adulthood. However, the
   molecular basis of the long-lasting effects of early life stress on
   brain function has not been completely elucidated. In this mini-review,
   we introduce various cases of maternal separation in rodents and
   illustrate the alterations in HPA-axis activity by focusing on
   corticosterone (CORT), an end-product of the HPA-axis in rodents. We
   then present the characterization of the brain regions affected by
   various patterns of MS, including RMS and single time maternal
   separation (SMS) at various stages before weaning, by investigating
   c-Fos expression, a biological marker of neuronal activity. These CORT
   and c-Fos studies suggest that repeated early life stress may affect
   neuronal function in region- and temporal-specific manners, indicating a
   critical period for habituation to early life stress. Furthermore, we
   introduce changes in behavioral aspects and gene expression in adult
   mice exposed to RMS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Electrochemical Study on the Effects of Epigenetic Cytosine Methylation
   on Anti-Benzo[a]pyrene Diol Epoxide Damage at TP53 Oligomers
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Anti-benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8-dihydrodiol-t-9,10-epoxide (anti-BPDE) is a
   known carcinogen that damages DNA, and this damage is influenced by the
   DNA sequence and epigenetic factors. The influence of epigenetic
   cytosine methylation on the reaction with anti-BPDE at a known hotspot
   DNA damage site was studied electrochemically. Gold electrodes were
   modified with thiolated DNA oligomers spanning codons 270-276 of the
   TP53 gene. The oligomers exhibited 5-carbon cytosine methylation at the
   codon 273 location on the bound probe, the acquired complementary
   target, or both. Redox active diviologen compounds of the form
   C(12)H(25)V(2+)C(6)H(12)V(2+)C(12)H(25) (V(2+) = 4,4'-bipyridyl or
   viologen, C12-Viologen) were employed to detect anti-BPDE damage to DNA.
   DNA was exposed to racemic (+/-)- or enantiomerically pure (+)-anti-BPDE
   solutions followed by electrochemical interrogation in the presence of
   C12-Viologen. Background subtracted square wave voltammograms (SWV)
   showed the appearance of two peaks at approximately -0.38 V and -0.55 V
   vs Ag/AgCl upon anti-BPDE exposure. The acquired voltammetry is
   consistent with singly reduced C12-Viologen dimers bound at two
   different DNA environments, which arise from BPDE damage and are
   influenced by cytosine methylation and BPDE stereochemical
   considerations. UV spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods employed
   to validate the electrochemical responses showed that (+)-anti-BPDE
   primarily adopts a minor groove bound orientation within the oligomers
   while selectively targeting the nontranscribed ssDNA sequence within the
   duplexes.

TI Methylmercury Production in Estuarine Sediments: Role of Organic Matter
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Methylmercury (MeHg) affects wildlife and human health mainly through
   marine fish consumption. In marine systems, MeHg is formed from
   inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) species primarily in sediments, then
   accumulates and biomagnifies in the food web. Most of the fish consumed
   in the United States are from estuarine and marine systems, highlighting
   the importance of understanding MeHg formation in these productive
   regions. Sediment organic matter has been shown to limit mercury
   methylation in estuarine ecosystems, as a result it is often described
   as the primary control over MeHg production. In this paper, we explore
   the role of organic matter by looking at the effects of its changing
   sediment concentrations on the methylation rates across multiple
   estuaries. We measured sedimentary MeHg production at eleven estuarine
   sites that were selected for their contrasting biogeochemical
   characteristics, mercury (Hg) content, and location in the Northeastern
   U.S. (ME, NH, CT, NY, and NJ). Sedimentary total Hg concentrations
   ranged across 5 orders of magnitude, increasing in concentration from
   the pristine, sandy sediments of Wells (ME), to industrially
   contaminated areas such as Portsmouth (NH) and Hackensack (NJ). We find
   that methylation rates are the highest at locations with high Hg content
   (relative to carbon), and that organic matter does not hinder mercury
   methylation in estuaries.

TI A beta-mixture quantile normalization method for correcting probe design
   bias in Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA methylation data
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: The Illumina Infinium450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a
   prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies
   (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that
   probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different
   DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias
   downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to
   adjust for the two different probe designs.
   Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization
   strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation),
   to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical
   distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves
   application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to
   methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into
   quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to
   preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our
   method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour
   tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two
   competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the
   robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical
   variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the
   type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes.
   BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the
   Illumina Infinium 450 k platform.

TI Epigenetic control of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer
   metastasis
SO EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH
AB Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is vital for morphogenesis
   during embryonic development and is also critical for the conversion of
   early stage tumors into invasive malignancies. Several key inducers of
   EMT are transcription factors that repress the expression of E-cadherin,
   whose loss is a hallmark of EMT. Epigenetic regulation encompasses three
   types of changes: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs,
   each of which has been shown to play a key role in controlling
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. As we gain
   deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms controlling EMT processes
   and orchestrating all the metastatic steps, we broaden the therapeutic
   potentials of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA demethylating drugs and
   histone deacetylase/demethylase inhibitors, which can act upon
   metastasis-related genes, restoring their expression and biological
   functions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Regional Activation of the Cancer Genome by Long-Range Epigenetic
   Remodeling
SO CANCER CELL
AB Epigenetic gene deregulation in cancer commonly occurs through chromatin
   repression and promoter hypermethylation of tumor-associated genes.
   However, the mechanism underpinning epigenetic-based gene activation in
   carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we identify a mechanism
   of domain gene deregulation through coordinated long-range epigenetic
   activation (LREA) of regions that typically span 1 Mb and harbor key
   oncogenes, microRNAs, and cancer biomarker genes. Gene promoters within
   LREA domains are characterized by a gain of active chromatin marks and a
   loss of repressive marks. Notably, although promoter hypomethylation is
   uncommon, we show that extensive DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands or
   "CpG-island borders" is strongly related to cancer-specific gene
   activation or differential promoter usage. These findings have wide
   ramifications for cancer diagnosis, progression, and epigenetic-based
   gene therapies.

TI Induction of human fetal hemoglobin expression by adenosine-2 ',3
   '-dialdehyde
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Pharmacologic reactivation of fetal hemoglobin expression is
   a promising strategy for treatment of sickle cell disease and
   beta-thalassemia. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   effect of the methyl transferase inhibitor adenosine-2',3'-dialdehyde
   (Adox) on induction of human fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in K562 cells and
   human hematopoietic progenitor cells.
   Methods: Expression levels of human fetal hemoglobin were assessed by
   northern blot analysis and Real-time PCR. HbF and adult hemoglobin (HbA)
   content were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC). DNA methylation levels on human gamma-globin gene promoters were
   determined using Bisulfite sequence analysis. Enrichment of histone
   marks on genes was assessed by chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP).
   Results: Adox induced gamma-globin gene expression in both K562 cells
   and in human bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells through a mechanism
   potentially involving inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5
   (PRMT5).
   Conclusions: The ability of methyl transferase inhibitors such as Adox
   to efficiently reactivate fetal hemoglobin expression suggests that
   these agents may provide a means of reactivating fetal globin expression
   as a therapeutic option for treating sickle cell disease and
   beta-thalassemia.

TI The effect of raw vegetable and fruit intake on thyroid cancer risk
   among women: a case-control study in South Korea
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer among Korean women. However,
   there are few data on dietary factors related to thyroid cancer risk.
   The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association
   between raw vegetables and fruits intake and thyroid cancer in a
   case-control study. We included 111 histologically confirmed malignant
   thyroid cancer cases and 115 benign cases. Controls who did not have
   nodules in thyroid ultrasonography were matched to cases by age (+/- 2
   years). Food and nutrient intakes were estimated using a quantitative
   FFQ with 121 items. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to
   obtain OR and corresponding 95% CI. The intake of total vegetables was
   not associated with malignant thyroid cancer, but inversely associated
   with benign cases. High raw vegetable intake was inversely associated
   with thyroid cancer risk both in malignant and benign cases (P for trend
   = 0.01 in both malignant and benign cases). Among fruits, persimmon
   intake had an inverse association with thyroid cancer risk in both
   malignant and benign cases (P for trend = 0.06 in malignant cases; P for
   trend = 0.01 in benign cases) and tangerine intake had an inverse
   association in malignant cases (P for trend = 0.03). The frequency of
   consumption of raw vegetables and persimmon also had a consistent
   inverse association in both malignant and benign cases. These results
   suggest that high consumption of raw vegetables, persimmons and
   tangerines may decrease thyroid cancer risk and help prevent early-stage
   thyroid cancer.

TI The COMPASS Subunit Spp1 Links Histone Methylation to Initiation of
   Meiotic Recombination
SO SCIENCE
AB During meiosis, combinatorial associations of genetic traits arise from
   homologous recombination between parental chromosomes. Histone H3 lysine
   4 trimethylation marks meiotic recombination hotspots in yeast and
   mammals, but how this ubiquitous chromatin modification relates to the
   initiation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) dependent on Spo11 remains
   unknown. Here, we show that the tethering of a PHD-containing protein,
   Spp1 (a component of the COMPASS complex), to recombinationally cold
   regions is sufficient to induce DSB formation. Furthermore, we found
   that Spp1 physically interacts with Mer2, a key protein of the
   differentiated chromosomal axis required for DSB formation. Thus, by
   interacting with H3K4me3 and Mer2, Spp1 promotes recruitment of
   potential meiotic DSB sites to the chromosomal axis, allowing Spo11
   cleavage at nearby nucleosome-depleted regions.

TI Characterization of the EZH2-MMSET Histone Methyltransferase Regulatory
   Axis in Cancer
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Histone methyltransferases (HMTases), as chromatin modifiers, regulate
   the transcriptomic landscape in normal development as well in diseases
   such as cancer. Here, we molecularly order two HMTases, EZH2 and MMSET,
   that have established genetic links to oncogenesis. EZH2, which mediates
   histone H3K27 trimethylation and is associated with gene silencing, was
   shown to be coordinately expressed and function upstream of MMSET, which
   mediates H3K36 dimethylation and is associated with active
   transcription. We found that the EZH2-MMSET HMTase axis is coordinated
   by a microRNA network and that the oncogenic functions of EZH2 require
   MMSET activity. Together, these results suggest that the EZH2-MMSET
   HMTase axis coordinately functions as a master regulator of
   transcriptional repression, activation, and oncogenesis and may
   represent an attractive therapeutic target in cancer.

TI Chronic restraint stress in rats causes sustained increase in urinary

SO PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Increased oxidatively generated damage to nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) may be
   a common mechanism underlying accelerated aging in psychological stress
   states and mental disorders. In the present study, we measured the
   urinary excretion of corticosterone and markers of systemic oxidative
   stress on nucleic acids, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG)
   and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo), respectively, in rats
   subjected to chronic restraint stress. To reliably collect 24 h urine
   samples, the full 3-week restraint stress paradigm was performed in
   metabolism cages. We further determined frontal cortex and hippocampal
   levels of oxidatively generated nuclear DNA damage, as measured by
   oxoguanine DNA glycosylase and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase
   sensitive sites detected by the comet assay, as well as the expression
   of genes involved in DNA repair (Ogg1 and Nudt1) and inflammation (Ccl2
   and Tnf). The metabolism cage housing in itself did not significantly
   influence a range of biological stress markers. In the restraint stress
   group, there was a sustained 2.5 fold increase in 24 h corticosterone
   excretion from day 2 after stress initiation. However, neither
   whole-body nor cerebral measures of nucleic acid damage from oxidation
   were affected by stress. In contrast, cerebral DNA repair enzymes
   exhibited a general trend towards an induction, which was significant
   for hippocampal Nudt1. The results and their implications for stress
   sensitivity and resilience are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Spp1, a Member of the Set1 Complex, Promotes Meiotic DSB Formation in
   Promoters by Tethering Histone H3K4 Methylation Sites to Chromosome Axes
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Meiotic chromosomes are organized into arrays of loops that are anchored
   to the chromosome axis structure. Programmed DNA double-strand breaks
   (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination, catalyzed by Spoil and
   accessory DSB proteins, form in loop sequences in promoters, whereas the
   DSB proteins are located on chromosome axes. Mechanisms bridging these
   two chromosomal regions for DSB formation have remained elusive. Here we
   show that Spp1, a conserved member of the histone H3K4 methyltransferase
   Set1 complex, is required for normal levels of DSB formation and is
   associated with chromosome axes during meiosis, where it physically
   interacts with the Mer2 DSB protein. The PHD finger module of Spp1,
   which reads H3K4 methylation close to promoters, promotes DSB formation
   by tethering these regions to chromosome axes and activating cleavage by
   the DSB proteins. This paper provides the molecular mechanism linking
   DSB sequences to chromosome axes and explains why H3K4 methylation is
   important for meiotic recombination.

TI Cell cycle-dependent deposition of CENP-A requires the Dos1/2-Cdc20
   complex
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Centromeric histone CENP-A, a variant of canonical histone H3, plays a
   central role in proper chromosome segregation. Loading of CENP-A at
   centromeres is cell cycle-regulated: parental CENP-A is deposited at
   centromeres during S phase, whereas newly synthesized CENP-A is
   deposited during later stages of the cell cycle. The mechanisms involved
   in deposition of CENP-A at centromeres during S phase remain poorly
   understood. In fission yeast, loading of CENP-A during S phase is
   regulated by the GATA-type factor, Ams2. Here we show that the
   Dos1/2-Cdc20 complex, previously characterized as a silencing complex
   essential for inheritance of H3K9 methylation during S phase, is also
   required for localization of CENP-A(cnp1) at centromeres at this stage.
   Disruption of Dos1 (also known as Raf1/Clr8/Cmc1), Dos2 (also known as
   Raf2/Clr7/Cmc2), or Cdc20, a DNA polymerase epsilon subunit, results in
   dissociation of CENP-A from centromeres and mislocalization of the
   protein to noncentromeric sites. All three mutants display spindle
   disorganization and mitotic defects. Inactivation of Dos1 or Cdc20 also
   results in accumulation of noncoding RNA transcripts from centromeric
   cores, a feature common to mutants affecting kinetochore integrity. We
   further find that Dos1 physically associates with Ams2 and is required
   for the association of Ams2 with centromeric cores during S phase.
   Finally, we show that Dos2 associates with centromeric cores during S
   phase and that its recruitment to centromeric cores depends on Cdc20.
   This study identifies a physical link between DNA replication and CENP-A
   assembly machinery and provides mechanistic insight into how CENP-A is
   faithfully inherited during S phase.

TI Snapshots: Chromatin control of viral infection
SO VIROLOGY
AB Like their cellular host counterparts, many invading viral pathogens
   must contend with, modulate, and utilize the host cell's chromatin
   machinery to promote efficient lytic infection or control
   persistent-latent states. While not intended to be comprehensive, this
   review represents a compilation of conceptual snapshots of the dynamic
   interplay of viruses with the chromatin environment. Contributions focus
   on chromatin dynamics during infection, viral circumvention of cellular
   chromatin repression, chromatin organization of large DNA viruses,
   tethering and persistence, viral interactions with cellular chromatin
   modulation machinery, and control of viral latency-reactivation cycles.

TI Thyroid hormone is highly permissive in angioproliferative pulmonary
   hypertension in rats
SO EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
AB Epidemiological evidence links pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
   with thyroid disease, but a mechanistic explanation for this association
   is lacking.
   Because a central hallmark of vascular remodelling in pulmonary
   hypertension is lumen obliteration by endothelial cell growth and
   because thyroid hormones are known to be angiogenic, we hypothesised
   that thyroid hormones play a role in the control of endothelial cell
   proliferation in experimental PAH in rats.
   Hypothyroidism was induced by subtotal thyroidectomy and treatment with
   propylthiouracil (PTU) in rats with experimental PAH after combined
   exposure to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition and
   hypoxia (the Sugen-chronic hypoxia (SuHx) model). Subtotal thyroidectomy
   prevented and PTU treatment reversed the development of severe
   experimental PAH. Thyroxin repletion restored the PAH phenotype in
   thyroidectomised SuHx rats. The prevention of PAH by thyroidectomy was
   associated with a reduced rate of cell turnover, reduced extracellular
   signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation, and reduced
   expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2
   and FGF receptor. Thyroidectomy mitigated hypoxia-induced pulmonary
   hypertension, but this effect was not associated with a decreased
   pulmonary vascular resistance.
   These data suggest that thyroid hormone permits endothelial cell
   proliferation in PAH. A causal link between thyroid diseases and the
   onset or progression of vascular remodelling in PAN patients remains to
   be determined.

   E51-E59, 2013. First published November 13, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00443.2012.-The stress-induced initiation of
   proapoptotic signaling in Leydig cells is relatively well defined, but
   the duration of this signaling and the mechanism(s) involved in opposing
   the stress responses have not been addressed. In this study,
   immobilization stress (IMO) was applied for 2 h daily, and animals were
   euthanized immediately after the first (IMO1), second (IMO2), and 10th
   (IMO10) sessions. In IMO1 and IMO2 rats, serum corticosterone and
   adrenaline were elevated, whereas serum androgens and mRNA transcription
   of insulin-like factor-3 in Leydig cells were inhibited. Reduced oxygen
   consumption and the mitochondrial membrane potential coupled with a leak
   of cytochrome c from mitochondria and increased caspase-9 expression,
   caspase-3 activity, and number of apoptotic Leydig cells was also
   observed. Corticosterone and adrenaline were also elevated in IMO10 rats
   but were accompanied with a partial recovery of androgen secretion and
   normalization of insulin-like factor-3 transcription coupled with
   increased cytochrome c expression, abolition of proapoptotic signaling,
   and normalization of the apoptotic events. Blockade of intratesticular
   glucocorticoid receptors diminished proapoptotic effects without
   affecting antiapoptotic effects, whereas blockade of intratesticular
   alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors diminished the antiapoptotic effects
   without affecting proapoptotic effects. These results confirmed a
   critical role of glucocorticoids in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and
   showed for the first time the relevance of stress-induced upregulation
   of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor expression in cell apoptotic resistance
   to repetitive IMOs. The opposite role of two hormones in control of the
   apoptotic rate in Leydig cells also provides a rationale for a partial
   recovery of androgen production in chronically stressed animals.

TI Stochastic changes affect Solanum wild species following
   autopolyploidization
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Polyploidy is very common within angiosperms, and several studies are in
   progress to ascertain the effects of early polyploidization at the
   molecular, physiological, and phenotypic level. Extensive studies are
   available only in synthetic allopolyploids. By contrast, less is known
   about the consequences of autopolyploidization. The current study aimed
   to assess the occurrence and extent of genetic, epigenetic, and
   anatomical changes occurring after oryzaline-induced polyploidization of
   Solanum commersonii Dunal and Solanum bulbocastanum Dunal, two diploid
   (2n224) potato species widely used in breeding programmes.
   Microsatellite analysis showed no polymorphisms between synthetic
   tetraploids and diploid progenitors. By contrast, analysis of DNA
   methylation levels indicated that subtle alterations at CG and CHG sites
   were present in tetraploids of both species. However, no change occurred
   concurrently in all tetraploids analysed with respect to their diploid
   parent, revealing a stochastic trend in the changes observed. The
   morpho-anatomical consequences of polyploidization were studied in leaf
   main veins and stomata. With only a few exceptions, analyses showed no
   clear superiority of tetraploids in terms of leaf thickness and area,
   vessel number, lumen size and vessel wall thickness, stomata pore length
   and width, guard cell width, and stomatal density compared with their
   diploid progenitors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that there are no traits systematically associated with autopolyploidy.

TI Thyroid disruption in the lizard Podarcis bocagei exposed to a mixture
   of herbicides: a field study
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB Pesticide exposure has been related with thyroid disrupting effects in
   different vertebrate species. However, very little is known about the
   effects of these compounds in reptiles. In the Mediterranean area,
   lacertid lizards are the most abundant vertebrate group in
   agroecosystems, and have been identified as potential model species for
   reptile ecotoxicology. The aim of this study was to understand if the
   herbicides applied in corn fields have thyroid disruptive effects in the
   lizard Podarcis bocagei. Adult male lizards were captured in
   north-western Portugal in corn fields treated with herbicides (exposed
   sites), and in organic agricultural fields (reference sites). Thyroid
   and male gonad morphology and functionality, and testosterone levels
   were investigated through histological, immunohistochemical and
   biochemical techniques. Lizards from exposed locations displayed thyroid
   follicular lumens with more reabsorption vacuoles and significantly
   larger follicular area than those from reference fields. Furthermore,
   testes of lizards from exposed locations had significantly larger
   seminiferous tubule diameters, significantly higher number of
   spermatogenic layers and displayed an up-regulation of thyroid hormone
   receptors when compared with lizards from reference areas. These
   findings strongly suggest that the complex mixture of herbicides that
   lizards are exposed to in agricultural areas have thyroid disrupting
   effects which ultimately affect the male reproductive system. Alachlor,
   which has demonstrated thyroid effects in mammals, may be largely
   responsible for the observed effects.

TI Epigenetic Inheritance of Disease and Disease Risk
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Epigenetic marks in an organism can be altered by environmental factors
   throughout life. Although changes in the epigenetic code can be
   positive, some are associated with severe diseases, in particular,
   cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent evidence has indicated
   that certain epigenetic marks can be inherited, and reshape
   developmental and cellular features over generations. This review
   examines the challenging possibility that epigenetic changes induced by
   environmental factors can contribute to some of the inheritance of
   disease and disease risk. This concept has immense implications for the
   understanding of biological functions and disease etiology, and provides
   potential novel strategies for diagnosis and treatment. Examples of
   epigenetic inheritance relevant to human disease, such as the
   detrimental effects of traumatic stress or drug/toxic exposure on brain
   functions, are reviewed. Different possible routes of transmission of
   epigenetic information involving the germline or germline-independent
   transfer are discussed, and different mechanisms for the maintenance and
   transmission of epigenetic information like chromatin remodeling and
   small noncoding RNAs are considered. Future research directions and
   remaining major challenges in this field are also outlined. Finally, the
   adaptive value of epigenetic inheritance, and the cost and benefit of
   allowing acquired epigenetic marks to persist across generations is
   critically evaluated. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews (2013) 38,

TI Chronic Cannabis Abuse, Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and Thyroid
   Function
SO PHARMACOPSYCHIATRY
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to obtain rather rare information
   about the influence of chronic cannabis abuse on thyroid function.
   Methods: Thyroid function tests (TSH, total T(3), free T(4)) of 39
   chronic cannabis-dependent subjects (ICD-10) were determined at
   admission (for in-patient detoxification). In a subgroup, serum levels
   of thyroid hormones were correlated with the serum levels of
   delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, N = 24) and its major metabolites,
   THC-OH (N = 16) and THC-COOH (N = 24).
   Results: All of the tested patients were found to have TSH, total T(3)
   and free T(4) levels within the population reference range. The levels
   of thyroid hormones did not correlate significantly with levels of THC,
   THC-OH or THC-COOH in serum.
   Conclusion: These results argue against a relevant influence of chronic
   cannabis intake on thyroid function in humans.

AB Objective: To determine, on the basis of iodide uptake inhibition (IUI),
   whether associations between urinary concentrations of JUT agents
   (perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate), as total perchlorate equivalent
   concentration (PEC), and serum thyroid parameters suggest functional
   thyroid abnormalities. Additional thyroid hormone measures were released
   to augment the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001 to
   2002 data set, which we used in this study. Methods: Enhanced thyroid
   hormone measures released to augment the National Health and Examination
   Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 data set were used in this study. Multiple
   regression was used to assess the relationships among total thyroxine
   (TT4), free thyroxine, total triiodothyronine (TT3), free
   triiodothyronine, and thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) and PEC.
   Results: PEC was weakly and negatively associated with TT4, but not with
   TSH; TT3, or free hormone. This association with TT4 appears to be
   dominated by nitrate and thiocyanate. Conclusion: No evidence of
   functional thyroid abnormality (eg., low thyroid hormone coupled with
   high TSH) was seen with exposure to the combined IUI agents and enhanced
   estimates of thyroid function.

TI Molecular Cloning, Tissue Expression, and Analysis with Genome DNA
   Methylation of Porcine LSD1 Gene
SO APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) functioned as a demethyl methylase
   gene, underlying a wide range of biological processes, including cancer,
   cell apoptosis, differentiation, and development. To further understand
   the functions of the porcine LSD1 gene, we first obtained cDNA sequence
   of porcine LSD1 gene, using in silico cloning method. We further found
   that the porcine LSD1 gene has two transcripts, in which cDNA sequences
   are 2,716 and 2,656 bp, ORF are 2,622 and 2,562 bp, respectively. Then,
   RT-PCR analysis showed that the LSD1 gene is expressed in various
   tissues and relatively higher in the tissues of ovary, kidney, and
   spleen. Besides, the LSD1 gene was expressed higher in the growth nonage
   and peaked at 3 days in muscle tissue. Meanwhile, the expression of two
   transcript variants of LSD1 gene presented the same change trend.
   Besides, the level of DNA methylation was approximately fourfold higher
   in a 3-day muscle than in an old pig (180 days), significantly positive
   related to the gene expression of LSD1 (R = 0.9362, P < 0.05), and
   declined with growing age. Cloning, expression pattern, and analysis
   with genome DNA methylation of porcine LSD1 gene laid a foundation to
   clarify the molecular mechanisms of porcine growth and development and
   also for further work on animal breeding.

TI Epigenetics and developmental plasticity across species
SO DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY
AB Plasticity is a typical feature of development and can lead to divergent
   phenotypes. There is increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms,
   such as DNA methylation, are present across species, are modifiable by
   the environment, and are involved in developmental plasticity. Thus, in
   the context of the concept of developmental homology, epigenetic
   mechanisms may serve to create a process homology between species by
   providing a common molecular pathway through which environmental
   experiences shape development, ultimately leading to phenotypic
   diversity. This article will highlight evidence derived from
   across-species investigations of epigenetics, development, and
   plasticity which may contribute to our understanding of the homology
   that exists between species and between ancestors and descendants. (c)

TI Exposure to a maternal n-3 fatty acid-deficient diet during brain
   development provokes excessive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
   responses to stress and behavioral indices of depression and anxiety in
   male rat offspring later in life
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) accumulates rapidly during
   brain development and is essential for normal neurological function. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate whether brain development was the
   critical period in which DHA deficiency leads to dysregulation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress later in
   life. Rats were exposed to an n-3 fatty acid-deficient diet or the same
   diet supplemented with fish oil as an n-3 fatty acid-adequate diet
   either throughout the preweaning period from embryo to weaning at 3
   weeks old or during the postweaning period from 3 to 10 weeks old.
   Exposure to the n-3 fatty acid-deficient diet during the preweaning
   period resulted, at weaning, in a significant decrease in hypothalamic
   DHA levels and a reduced male offspring body weight. DHA deficiency
   during the preweaning period significantly increased and prolonged
   restraint stress-induced changes in colonic temperature and serum
   corticosterone levels, caused a significant increase in GABA(A)
   antagonist-induced heart rate changes and enhanced depressive-like
   behavior in the forced swimming test and anxiety-like behavior in the
   plus-maze test in later life. These effects were not seen in male rats
   fed the n-3 fatty acid-deficient diet during the postweaning period.
   These results suggest that brain development is the critical period in
   which DHA deficiency leads to excessive HPA responses to stress and
   elevated behavioral indices of depression and anxiety in adulthood. We
   propose that these effects of hypothalamic DHA deficiency during brain
   development may involve a GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanism. (c) 2013

TI H3K9 methylation is a barrier during somatic cell reprogramming into
   iPSCs
SO NATURE GENETICS
AB The induction of pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by defined factors is
   poorly understood stepwise. Here, we show that histone H3 lysine 9
   (H3K9) methylation is the primary epigenetic determinant for the
   intermediate pre-iPSC state, and its removal leads to fully reprogrammed
   iPSCs. We generated a panel of stable pre-iPSCs that exhibit pluripotent
   properties but do not activate the core pluripotency network, although
   they remain sensitive to vitamin C for conversion into iPSCs. Bone
   morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) were subsequently identified in serum as
   critical signaling molecules in arresting reprogramming at the pre-iPSC
   state. Mechanistically, we identified H3K9 methyltransferases as
   downstream targets of BMPs and showed that they function with their
   corresponding demethylases as the on/off switch for the pre-iPSC fate by
   regulating H3K9 methylation status at the core pluripotency loci. Our
   results not only establish pre-iPSCs as an epigenetically stable
   signpost along the reprogramming road map, but they also provide
   mechanistic insights into the epigenetic reprogramming of cell fate.

TI Histone H3 lysine 27 and 9 hypermethylation within the Bad promoter
   region mediates 5-Aza-2 '-deoxycytidine-induced Leydig cell apoptosis:
   implications of 5-Aza-2 '-deoxycytidine toxicity to male reproduction
SO APOPTOSIS
AB 5-Aza-2'-deoxycitidine (5-Aza), an anticancer agent, results in
   substantial toxicity to male reproduction, causing a decline in sperm
   quality associated with reduced testosterone. Here, we report that 5-Aza
   increased the apoptotic protein Bad epigenetically in the
   testosterone-producing mouse TM3 Leydig cell line. 5-Aza decreased cell
   viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner with concomitant increase
   in Bad protein. This increase is accompanied by increased cleavages of
   both poly ADP ribose polymerase and caspase-3. Flow cytometric analysis
   further supported 5-Aza-derived apoptosis in TM3 cells. Bisulfite
   sequencing analysis failed to identify putative methylcytosine site(s)
   in CpG islands of the Bad promoter. A chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assay revealed decreased levels of trimethylation at lysine 27 of
   histone H3 (H3K27-3me) and H3K9-3me in the Bad promoter region in
   response to 5-Aza treatment. Knock-down by siRNA of enhancer of zeste
   homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase responsible for
   H3K27-3me, or demethylation of H3K9-3me by BIX-01294 showed
   significantly increased levels in Bad expression and consequent Leydig
   cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first
   time that Bad expression is regulated at least by EZH2-mediated
   H3K27-3me or G9a-like protein/euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1
   (GLP/Eu-HMTase1)-mediated H3K9-3me in mouse TM3 Leydig cells, which may
   be implicated in 5-Aza-derived toxicity to male reproduction.

TI Temperature affects the early life history stages of corals more than
   near future ocean acidification
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Climate change is projected to increase ocean temperatures by at least 2
   C, and levels of pH by similar to 0.2 units (ocean acidification, OA) by
   the end of this century. While the effects of these stressors on marine
   organisms have been relatively well explored in isolation, possible
   interactions between temperature and OA have yet to be thoroughly
   investigated. OA at levels projected to occur within this century has
   few direct ecological effects on the early life history stages of
   corals. In contrast, temperature has pronounced effects on many stages
   in the early life history of corals. Here, we test whether temperature
   might act in combination with OA to produce a measurable ecological
   effect on fertilization, development, larval survivorship or
   metamorphosis of 2 broadcast spawning species, Acropora millepora and A.
   tenuis, from the Great Barrier Reef. We used 4 treatments: control, high
   temperature (+2 degrees C), high partial pressure of CO(2) (pCO(2)) (700
   mu atm) and a combination of high temperature and high pCO(2),
   corresponding to the current levels of these variables and the projected
   values for the end of this century under the IPCC A2 scenario. We found
   no consistent effect of elevated pCO(2) on fertilization, development,
   survivorship or metamorphosis, neither alone nor in combination with
   temperature. In contrast, a 2 degrees C rise in temperature increased
   rates of development, but otherwise had no consistent effect on
   fertilization, survivorship or metamorphosis. We conclude that OA is
   unlikely to be a direct threat to the early life history stages of
   corals, at least in the near future. In contrast, rising sea
   temperatures are likely to affect coral population dynamics by
   increasing the rate of larval development with resulting changes in
   patterns of connectivity.

TI A Newly Uncovered Group of Distantly Related Lysine Methyltransferases
   Preferentially Interact with Molecular Chaperones to Regulate Their
   Activity
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Methylation is a post-translational modification that can affect
   numerous features of proteins, notably cellular localization, turnover,
   activity, and molecular interactions. Recent genome-wide analyses have
   considerably extended the list of human genes encoding putative
   methyltransferases. Studies on protein methyltransferases have revealed
   that the regulatory function of methylation is not limited to
   epigenetics, with many non-histone substrates now being discovered. We
   present here our findings on a novel family of distantly related
   putative methyltransferases. Affinity purification coupled to mass
   spectrometry shows a marked preference for these proteins to associate
   with various chaperones. Based on the spectral data, we were able to
   identify methylation sites in substrates, notably trimethylation of K135
   of KIN/Kin17, K561 of HSPA8/Hsc70 as well as corresponding lysine
   residues in other Hsp70 isoforms, and K315 of VCP/p97. All modification
   sites were subsequently confirmed in vitro. In the case of VCP,
   methylation by METTL21D was stimulated by the addition of the UBX
   cofactor ASPSCR1, which we show directly interacts with the
   methyltransferase. This stimulatory effect was lost when we used VCP
   mutants (R155H, R159G, and R191Q) known to cause Inclusion Body Myopathy
   with Paget's disease of bone and Fronto-temporal Dementia (IBMPFD)
   and/or familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Lysine 315 falls in
   proximity to the Walker B motif of VCP's first ATPase/D1 domain. Our
   results indicate that methylation of this site negatively impacts its
   ATPase activity. Overall, this report uncovers a new role for protein
   methylation as a regulatory pathway for molecular chaperones and defines
   a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation
   is causative of degenerative neuromuscular diseases.

TI Playful handling as social enrichment for individually- and group-housed
   laboratory rats
SO APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE
AB Social housing is recommended for laboratory rats because they are
   highly social mammals but research constraints or medical issues often
   demand individual housing and, when social housing is practiced, it
   typically involves housing with only one or two conspecifics. We
   hypothesized that playful social contact with humans (i.e. tickling),
   mimicking the dorsal contacts and pins characteristic of rat
   rough-and-tumble play, could act as a partial substitute for, or
   supplement to, conspecific social contact in situations when laboratory
   rats are housed individually or in pairs or triplets. Furthermore, we
   hypothesized that the beneficial effects of regular tickling when young
   would persist following discontinuation of tickling. Accordingly, we
   investigated the responses of juvenile male rats to handling conditions
   (minimally handled vs. tickled) and group size (singletons, pairs,
   triplets). We measured (a) production of 22- and 50-kHz ultrasonic
   vocalizations (USVs) during a 1-min period before handling (interpreted
   as evidence for negative and positive affective states, respectively),
   (b) corticosterone levels from faecal pellets collected in the home
   cage, and pre- and post-treatment body weight (as measures of
   physiological stress), and (c) behaviour in an Open Field test (to
   assess anxiety). After 3 weeks of tickling for 2 min/day,
   individually-housed rats produced more 50-kHz USVs in anticipation of
   handling than their minimally-handled counterparts (P<0.0001). This
   effect persisted for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of the
   tickling programme (P<0.0001), when all rats were transferred to
   individual housing. Tickling experience also reduced anxiety-related
   behaviour of individually-housed rats in the Open Field test (P<0.05).
   Faecal corticosterone levels and body weight were not affected by
   tickling experience or group size, although both corticosterone levels
   and anxiety-related behaviour were elevated following re-housing
   (P<0.05). No significant differences were detected between rats housed
   as pairs or triplets for any of the measures investigated (P>0.05). Both
   the Open Field and USV data affirm that tickling is beneficial for rats,
   especially when housed individually, and provide evidence that specific
   experiences derived from playful contact contribute to the well-being of
   group-housed animals. We conclude that tickling is an appropriate
   cross-species social enrichment manoeuver that can promote the
   well-being of laboratory rats and rats kept as companion animals. (C)

TI Epigenetics in autoimmune diseases with focus on type 1 diabetes
SO DIABETES-METABOLISM RESEARCH AND REVIEWS
AB Autoimmune diseases arise when the body mounts an immune response
   against self cells and tissues causing inflammation and damage. It is
   commonly accepted that these diseases develop because of the interplay
   of genetic and environmental factors. Evidence for genetic factors
   includes the higher concordance of disease in monozygotic twins than in
   dizygotic twins. However, monozygotic twins may remain discordant for
   disease indicating a role for environmental factors. Environmental
   factors may alter gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. This is
   particularly pertinent in type 1 diabetes in which DNA methylation and
   histone modifications have been associated with altered gene expression.
   The low disease concordance rate in adult-onset type 1 diabetes (< 20%)
   suggests that environmental and epigenetic changes may play a
   predominant role. Defining the role of epigenetic changes could identify
   specific gene pathways and dysregulated expression of gene products that
   contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. This article reviews
   how epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to the development of
   autoimmune diseases with a focus on type 1 diabetes. Copyright (C) 2012

TI CpG Island Hypermethylation Frequently Silences FILIP1L Isoform 2
   Expression in Prostate Cancer
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Purpose: Senescence related regulatory pathways serve as barriers to
   cancer immortalization and progression but they are currently not well
   defined. FILIP1L is a growth inhibitory gene with multiple isoforms
   whose expression is increased in senescent prostate and prostate cancer
   cells, and decreased in many cancers. We investigated whether DNA
   methylation regulates FILIP1L in senescence and in prostate cancer
   development.
   Materials and Methods: FILIP1L mRNA expression was assessed in prostate
   cancer and associated normal prostate tissues using quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction. A tissue microarray was constructed using 95
   prostate cancer specimens and 45 benign prostate specimens. Vectra (TM)
   imaging was used to quantitate nuclear and cytoplasmic FILIP1L protein
   expression. Bisulfite sequencing and Pyrosequencing (R) were used to
   assess methylation. Prostate cancer cell lines were treated with
   2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine and mRNA expression was assessed.
   Results: FILIP1L isoform 2 mRNA was increased in replicatively senescent
   human prostate epithelial cells and decreased in prostate cancer
   specimens. We verified a reduction in nuclear FILIP1L protein in
   prostate cancer using tissue microarrays (p = 0.006). A CpG island 5' of
   the isoform 2 translational start site was identified that showed
   hypermethylation in prostate cancer cell lines and tumors compared to
   normal prostate cells and tissues. Pyrosequencing confirmed FILIP1L
   hypermethylation in all 14 tumors compared to paired normal tissues (p <
   0.0001). Isoform 2 expression was induced in prostate cancer cell lines
   using 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine.
   Conclusions: FILIP1L isoform 2 is one of the most commonly
   hypermethylated genes in prostate cancer. It may serve as an important
   marker of prostate cancer. Isoform 2 expression is associated with
   senescence and its down-regulation may represent an early important
   biological event in prostate cancer development.

TI Transcriptome-wide mapping of N(6)-methyladenosine by m(6)A-seq based on
   immunocapturing and massively parallel sequencing
SO NATURE PROTOCOLS
AB N(6)-methyladenosine-sequencing (m(6)A-seq) is an immunocapturing
   approach for the unbiased transcriptome-wide localization of m(6)A in
   high resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol to allow a
   global view of this ubiquitous RNA modification, and it is based on
   antibody-mediated enrichment of methylated RNA fragments followed by
   massively parallel sequencing. Building on principles of chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and methylated DNA
   immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), read densities of immunoprecipitated RNA
   relative to untreated input control are used to identify methylated
   sites. A consensus motif is deduced, and its distance to the point of
   maximal enrichment is assessed; these measures further corroborate the
   success of the protocol. Identified locations are intersected in turn
   with gene architecture to draw conclusions regarding the distribution of
   m(6)A between and within gene transcripts. When applied to human and
   mouse transcriptomes, m(6)A-seq generated comprehensive methylation
   profiles revealing, for the first time, tenets governing the nonrandom
   distribution of m(6)A. The protocol can be completed within similar to 9
   d for four different sample pairs (each consists of an
   immunoprecipitation and corresponding input).

TI High CO(2) reduces the settlement of a spawning coral on three common
   species of crustose coralline algae
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Concern about the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on ecosystem
   function has prompted many studies to focus on larval recruitment,
   demonstrating declines in settlement and early growth at elevated CO(2)
   concentrations. Since larval settlement is often driven by particular
   cues governed by crustose coralline algae (CCA), it is important to
   determine whether OA reduces larval recruitment with specific CCA and
   the generality of any effects. We tested the effect of elevated CO(2) on
   the survival and settlement of larvae from the common spawning coral
   Acropora selago with 3 ecologically important species of CCA, Porolithon
   onkodes, Sporolithon sp., and Titanoderma sp. After 3 d in no-choice
   laboratory assays at 447, 705, and 1214 mu atm pCO(2), the rates of
   coral settlement declined as pCO(2) increased with all CCA taxa. The
   magnitude of the effect was highest with Titanoderma sp., decreasing by
   87% from the ambient to highest CO(2) treatment. In general, there were
   high rates of larval mortality, which were greater with the P. onkodes
   and Sporolithon sp. treatments (similar to 80%) compared to the
   Titanoderma sp. treatment (65%). There was an increase in larval
   mortality as pCO(2) increased, but this was variable among the CCA
   species. It appears that OA reduces coral settlement by rapidly altering
   the chemical cues associated with the CCA thalli and microbial
   community, and potentially by directly affecting larval viability.

TI EPD and EPDnew, high-quality promoter resources in the next-generation
   sequencing era
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD), available online at
   http://epd.vital-it.ch, is a collection of experimentally defined
   eukaryotic POL II promoters which has been maintained for more than 25
   years. A promoter is represented by a single position in the genome,
   typically the major transcription start site (TSS). EPD primarily serves
   biologists interested in analysing the motif content, chromatin
   structure or DNA methylation status of co-regulated promoter subsets.
   Initially, promoter evidence came from TSS mapping experiments targeted
   at single genes and published in journal articles. Today, the TSS
   positions provided by EPD are inferred from next-generation sequencing
   data distributed in electronic form. Traditionally, EPD has been a
   high-quality database with low coverage. The focus of recent efforts has
   been to reach complete gene coverage for important model organisms. To
   this end, we introduced a new section called EPDnew, which is
   automatically assembled from multiple, carefully selected input
   datasets. As another novelty, we started to use chromatin signatures in
   addition to mRNA 5'tags to locate promoters of weekly expressed genes.
   Regarding user interfaces, we introduced a new promoter viewer which
   enables users to explore promoter-defining experimental evidence in a
   UCSC genome browser window.

TI Mechanisms of catalytic action and chemical modifications of
   endonucleases WEN1 and WEN2 from wheat seedlings
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB Hydrolysis of DNA catalyzed by wheat endonucleases WEN1 and WEN2 is
   pronouncedly processive. A correlation has been revealed between
   appearance of new products of DNA hydrolysis with different length and
   conformational changes in the enzymes. The first conformational
   conversion of the endonucleases is associated with appearance of large
   fragments of DNA hydrolysis with length longer than 500 bp, and the
   second conversion is associated with formation of oligonucleotides with
   length of 120-140 bp, and the third conversion is associated with
   formation of short oligonucleotides and mononucleotides. Formation of
   the DNA-enzyme complex is accompanied by appearance of fluorescence at
   lambda = 410-440 nm. The intensity, positions, and numbers of maximums
   of the fluorescence spectra of DNA-WEN1 and DNA-WEN2 complexes are
   different and depend on the methylation status of the DNA and on the
   presence of Mg(2+). The endonucleases hydrolyze DNA by two mechanisms:
   one is metal-independent, and the other depends on one or two Mg(2+)
   ions. One Mg(2+) ion is located inside the catalytic center of WEN1,
   whereas the WEN2 center contains two Mg(2+) ions. The first
   (sitespecific) stage of DNA hydrolysis does not depend on Mg(2+). Mg(2+)
   ions evoke changes in the site specificity of the endonuclease action
   (WEN1) and abolish their ability to recognize the methylation status of
   DNA. Products of DNA hydrolysis by endonucleases WEN1 and WEN2 in the
   presence of Mg(2+) are similar in length (120-140 bp). The endonucleases
   have at least two centers (domains) - catalytic and substrate-binding.
   Two histidine and apparently two lysine plus two dicarboxylic amino acid
   residues are present inside the catalytic center of WEN1. The catalytic
   center of WEN2 contains at least one histidine residue and apparently
   two residues of aspartic or glutamic acid, which are involved in
   coordination of the metal ions. The catalytic centers of WEN1 and WEN2
   seem to be formed, respectively, by HD/E(D/EK)KH and HD/ED/E amino acid
   residues. The site-specificity of the endonuclease action is due to the
   DNA-binding domain. This domain contains dicarboxylic amino acid
   residues, which seem to be responsible for sensitivity of the enzymes to
   the methylation status of DNA. The hydroxyl groups of tyrosine residues
   in the enzymes also seem to contribute to recognizing methylated bases
   in DNA. DOI: 10.1134/S0006297913010057

TI Performance Differences Between Conventional Smears and Liquid-Based
   Preparations of Thyroid Fine-Needle Aspiration Samples Analysis of 47
   076 Responses in the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory
   Comparison Program in Non-Gynecologic Cytology
SO ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
AB Context.-Controversy exists about whether thyroid fine-needle aspirates
   (FNAs) should be processed with conventional smears or liquid-based
   preparations (LBPs).
   Objective.-To compare the performance of conventional smears to LBPs for
   thyroid FNA slides circulated in the College of American Pathologists
   Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Non-Gynecologic Cytology.
   Design.-Participant responses for thyroid FNA slides were compared with
   the reference diagnosis at the level of 3 general diagnostic categories:
   negative, suspicious (which included only follicular and Hurthle cell
   neoplasm), and malignant. For specific reference diagnoses of
   benign/goiter and papillary thyroid carcinoma, the participants'
   specific diagnoses were analyzed and poorly performing slides were
   rereviewed.
   Results.-The 47 076 thyroid FNA slide responses, between 2001 and 2009,
   included 44 478 responses (94%) for conventional smears and 2598
   responses (6%) for LBPs. For the general reference category negative,
   participant responses were discrepant in 14.9% of conventional smears
   compared with 5.9% for LBPs (P < .001). The specific reference diagnosis
   of benign/goiter was misdiagnosed as a follicular neoplasm in 7.8% of
   conventional smears, compared with 1.3% of LBP. For the general
   reference category of malignant, participant responses were discrepant
   in 7.3% of conventional smears compared with 14.7% of LBPs (P < .001).
   The specific reference diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma was
   misdiagnosed as benign/goiter in 7.2% of LBPs, compared with 4.8% of
   conventional smears (p < .001).
   Conclusions.-LBPs performed worse than conventional smears for cases
   with a reference diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, LBPs
   performed better than conventional smears for cases with a benign
   reference diagnosis. Specific features in thyroid FNAs that may improve
   the diagnostic accuracy of LBPs and conventional smears are described.

TI Effects of High Fluoride and Low Iodine on Thyroid Function in Offspring
   Rats
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups of eight
   with six females and two males in each group. The rats were exposed to
   high fluoride drinking water (45 mg F-L-1 from 100 mg NaF L-1), low
   dietary iodine (0.0855 mg kg(-1)), or both together in order to assess
   the effects of these three regimens on the thyroid function of the
   offspring rats. After the animal model was established, the offspring
   rats were bred and 10-, 20-, 30-, 60-, and 90-d-old rats were used for
   the experiment. The treatments for the offspring rats were the same as
   those of their parents. In comparison with control rats, the relative
   thyroid glands were changed by three regimens, but the mean values of
   thyroid weight in the experimental groups saw no marked difference.
   Serum TT3 levels were increased in all stages in the low iodine (LI)
   group. In the high fluoride (HiF) group, increase in TT3 levels was
   observed except in 20-d-old rats. Decrease in TT3 at 20- and 90-d and
   increase in TT3 at 30- and 60-d were found in HiF+LI group. Serum TT4
   levels first saw an increase, and then dropped in the LI and HiF+LI
   group. However, an increase in TT4 was found in the HiF group. The
   levels of TSH in serum rocketed at d 20, and then dropped in the next
   stages in experimental groups. The results suggested that thyroid
   disorder could be induced by high flroride in drinking water, low iodine
   diet, or both of them. Exposure time to fluoride or low iodine diet was
   one of the important factors that fluoride can induce the development of
   thyroid dyfunction.

TI Incidence of invasive macrophytes on methylmercury budget in temperate
   lakes: Central role of bacterial periphytic communities
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Several studies demonstrated high mercury (Hg) methylation and
   demethylation in the periphyton associated with floating roots in
   tropical ecosystems. The importance of aquatic plants on methylmercury
   production in three temperate ecosystems from south-western France was
   evaluated through Hg species concentrations, and Hg
   methylation/demethylation activities by using stable isotopic tracers
   ((199)Hg(II), Me(201)Hg). Hg accumulation and high methylation and
   demethylation yields were detected in plant roots and periphyton,
   whereas results for sediment and water were low to insignificant. The
   presence of sulfate reducing prokaryotes was detected in all
   compartments (T-RFLP based on dsrAB amplified through nested PCR) and
   their main role in Hg methylation could be demonstrated. In turn,
   sulfate reduction inhibition did not affect demethylation activities.
   The estimation of net MeHg budgets in these ecosystems suggested that
   aquatic rhizosphere is the principal location for methylmercury
   production and may represent an important source for the contamination
   of the aquatic food chain. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Placental development during early pregnancy in sheep: Effects of embryo
   origin on fetal and placental growth and global methylation
SO THERIOGENOLOGY
AB The origin of embryos including those created through assisted
   reproductive technologies might have profound effects on placental and
   fetal development, possibly leading to compromised pregnancies
   associated with poor placental development. To determine the effects of
   embryo origin on fetal size, and maternal and fetal placental cellular
   proliferation and global methylation, pregnancies were achieved through
   natural mating (NAT), or transfer of embryos generated through in vivo
   (NAT-ET), IVF, or in vitro activation (IVA). On Day 22 of pregnancy,
   fetuses were measured and placental tissues were collected to
   immunologically detect Ki67 (a marker of proliferating cells) and
   5-methyl cytosine followed by image analysis, and determine mRNA
   expression for three DNA methyl-transferases. Fetal length and labeling
   index (proportion of proliferating cells) in maternal caruncles
   (maternal placenta) and fetal membranes (fetal placenta) were less (P <
   0.001) in NAT-ET, IVF, and IVA than in NAT. In fetal membranes,
   expression of 5-methyl cytosine was greater (P <0.02) in IVF and IVA
   than in NAT. In maternal caruncles, mRNA expression for DNMT1 was
   greater (P < 0.01) in IVA compared with the other groups, but DNMT3A
   expression was less (P < 0.04) in NAT-ET and IVA than in NAT. In fetal
   membranes, expression of mRNA for DNMT3A was greater (P < 0.01) in IVA
   compared with the other groups, and was similar in NAT, NAT-ET, and IVF
   groups. Thus, embryo origin might have specific effects on growth and
   function of ovine uteroplacental and fetal tissues through regulation of
   tissue growth. DNA methylation, and likely other mechanisms. These data
   provide a foundation for determining expression of specific factors
   regulating placental and fetal tissue growth and function in normal and
   compromised pregnancies, including those achieved with assisted
   reproductive technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Gestational exposure to diethylstilbestrol alters cardiac
   structure/function, protein expression and DNA methylation in adult male
   mice progeny
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Pregnant women, and thus their fetuses, are exposed to many endocrine
   disruptor compounds (EDCs). Fetal cardiomyocytes express sex hormone
   receptors making them potentially susceptible to re-programming by
   estrogenizing EDCs. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a proto-typical,
   non-steroidal estrogen. We hypothesized that changes in adult cardiac
   structure/function after gestational exposure to the test compound DES
   would be a proof in principle for the possibility of estrogenizing
   environmental EDCs to also alter the fetal heart. Vehicle (peanut oil)
   or DES (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mu g/kg/da.) was orally delivered to pregnant
   C57bl/6n dams on gestation days 11.5-14.5. At 3 months, male progeny
   were left sedentary or were swim trained for 4 weeks. Echocardiography
   of isoflurane anesthetized mice revealed similar cardiac
   structure/function in all sedentary mice, but evidence of systolic
   dysfunction and increased diastolic relaxation after swim training at
   higher DES doses. The calcium homeostasis proteins, SERCA2a,
   phospholamban, phospho-serine 16 phospholamban and calsequestrin 2, are
   important for cardiac contraction and relaxation. Immunoblot analyses of
   ventricle homogenates showed increased expression of SERCA2a and
   calsequestrin 2 in DES mice and greater molecular remodeling of these
   proteins and phospho-serine 16 phospholamban in swim trained DES mice.
   DES increased cardiac DNA methyltransferase 3a expression and DNA
   methylation in the CpG island within the calsequestrin 2 promoter in
   heart. Thus, gestational DES epigenetically altered ventricular DNA,
   altered cardiac function and expression, and reduced the ability of
   adult progeny to cardiac remodel when physically challenged. We conclude
   that gestational exposure to estrogenizing EDCs may impact cardiac
   structure/function in adult males. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI CT-scan prediction of thyroid cartilage invasion for early laryngeal
   squamous cell carcinoma
SO EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
AB Treatment choice for laryngeal cancer may be influenced by the diagnosis
   of thyroid cartilage invasion on preoperative computed tomography (CT).
   Our objective was to determine the predictive value of CT for thyroid
   cartilage invasion in early- to mid-stage laryngeal cancer.
   Retrospective study (1992-2008) of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
   treated with open partial laryngectomy and resection of at least part of
   the thyroid cartilage. Previous laser surgery, radiation therapy,
   chemotherapy and second primaries were excluded. CT prediction of
   thyroid cartilage invasion was determined by specialized radiologists.
   Tumor characteristics and pathologic thyroid cartilage invasion were
   compared to the radiologic assessment. 236 patients were treated by
   vertical (20 %), supracricoid (67 %) or supraglottic partial
   laryngectomy (13 %) for tumors staged cT1 (26 %), cT2 (55 %), and cT3
   (19 %). The thyroid cartilage was invaded on pathology in 19 cases (8
   %). CT's sensitivity was 10.5 %, specificity 94 %, positive predictive
   value 13 %, and negative predictive value 92 %. CT correctly predicted
   thyroid cartilage invasion in only two cases for an overall accuracy of
   87 %. Among the false-positive CT's, tumors involving the anterior
   commissure were significantly over-represented (61.5 % vs. 27 %, p =
   .004). Tumors with decreased vocal fold (VF) mobility were significantly
   over-represented in the group of false-negatives (41 vs. 13 %, p =
   .0035). Preoperative CT was not effective in predicting thyroid
   cartilage invasion in these early- to mid-stage lesions, overestimating
   cartilage invasion for AC lesions and underestimating invasion for
   lesions with decreased VF mobility.

TI The Spt4-Spt5 complex: A multi-faceted regulator of transcription
   elongation
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB In all domains of life, elongating RNA polymerases require the
   assistance of accessory factors to maintain their processivity and
   regulate their rate. Among these elongation factors, the Spt5/NusG
   factors stand out. Members of this protein family appear to be the only
   transcription accessory proteins that are universally conserved across
   all domains of life. In archaea and eukaryotes, Spt5 associates with a
   second protein, Spt4. In addition to regulating elongation, the
   eukaryotic Spt4-Spt5 complex appears to couple chromatin modification
   states and RNA processing to transcription elongation. This review
   discusses the experimental bases for our current understanding of
   Spt4-Spt5 function and recent studies that are beginning to elucidate

TI Human Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD-1) Gene Expression Is Negatively
   Regulated by Thyroid Hormone without Direct Binding of Thyroid Hormone
   Receptor to the Gene Promoter
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) plays a pivotal role in an increase of
   triglyceride by an excess of dietary carbohydrate intake. Dietary
   carbohydrates increase SCD-1 gene expression in liver by sterol response
   element binding protein (SREBP)-1c-dependent and SREBP-1c-independent
   pathways. Previous report demonstrated that thyroid hormone (TH)
   negatively regulates mouse SCD-1 gene promoter before SREBP-1c was
   revealed. We reported that TH negatively regulates SREBP-1c recently.
   Therefore, in the current study, we examined whether and how TH
   regulates human SCD-1 gene expression and evaluated SREBP-1c effect on
   the negative regulation. Luciferase assays revealed that TH suppresses
   both mouse and human SCD-1 gene promoter activity. In SREBP-1 knockdown
   HepG2 cells, TH still suppresses SCD-1 gene promoter activity, and it
   also exerted the negative regulation under cotransfection of a small
   amount of SREBP-1c. These data indicated that SREBP-1c does not play the
   decisive role for the negative regulation by TH. The responsible region
   for the negative regulation in human SCD-1 gene promoter turned out to
   be between -124 and -92 bp, referred to as site A. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TH receptor-beta is
   recruited to the region upon T(3) administration, although TR-beta does
   not bind directly to site A. In conclusion, TH negatively regulates
   human SCD-1 gene expression in without direct binding of the TH receptor
   to the SCD-1 gene promoter. (Endocrinology 154: 537-549, 2013)

TI Sex-specific offspring growth according to maternal testosterone,
   corticosterone, and glucose levels
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
AB Sex allocation theory in vertebrates has greatly benefited from the
   recent advances in studies on the physiological mechanisms of birth sex
   ratio variation (e.g., maternal glucose, stress, and testosterone
   levels). The same physiological mechanisms may, however, also mediate
   permanent sex-specific effects on individuals after birth. Together with
   biased maternal postpartum investment on sex allocation, they can have
   long-term fitness consequences for the offspring. We studied whether
   maternal preconception levels of serum glucose and testosterone, and
   fecal corticosterone metabolites differently influenced male and female
   pup weight until weaning in field voles (Microtus agrestis). In this
   species, high maternal preconception serum glucose and testosterone
   levels have previously been associated with the excess of male pups at
   birth. Our results suggest that male, but not female, pup weight
   increases with higher maternal preconception testosterone level whereas
   high maternal serum glucose level promoted female pup weight only. The
   level of maternal fecal corticosterone metabolites was not related to
   pup weight in either sex. These findings suggest that in field voles the
   same physiological mechanisms influencing sex ratio at birth may also
   influence offspring postnatal weight; however, such influences can act
   in conflict, as seen in the case of maternal glucose level.

TI Sonography of intrathyroid parathyroid adenomas: Are there distinctive
   features that allow for preoperative identification?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Objective: The purpose of our study was to determine if intra-thyroid
   parathyroid adenomas can be accurately identified by applying proposed
   criteria to preoperative ultrasound examinations in patients with
   primary hyperparathyroidism.
   Materials/methods: Fifty-three patients with pathology proven
   intra-thyroid parathyroid adenomas and pre-operative ultrasounds were
   identified from a surgical database for a blinded, retrospective review.
   A contemporary, age-matched cohort of 54 patients with extra-thyroid
   parathyroid adenomas was identified as a control. A total of 64 patients
   within these cohorts had co-existing thyroid nodules. Proposed
   ultrasound criteria for identifying a parathyroid adenoma included solid
   composition, profound hypoechogenicity, and presence of a feeding polar
   vessel. Parathyroid adenomas were classified as extra-thyroid or
   intra-thyroid (partial or complete) based on their relationship with the
   thyroid gland during ultrasound evaluation and results were compared to
   surgical and histopathology reports as the gold standard. The results
   from the blinded, retrospective review during which the proposed,
   specific ultrasound criteria were applied were compared to the initial,
   pre-operative reports during which the proposed criteria were not
   applied. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
   negative predictive value and accuracy of the blinded, retrospective
   review and initial, pre-operative reports were calculated. Additionally,
   in patients with co-existing thyroid nodules, an attempt was made to
   differentiate parathyroid adenomas from the thyroid nodules.
   Results: Application of the proposed ultrasound criteria during blinded
   retrospective review yielded a sensitivity and specificity for detecting
   intra-thyroid parathyroid adenomas of 76% and 92%, respectively. The
   sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for detecting intra-thyroid
   parathyroid adenomas on the initial reports was 29% and 95%,
   respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for differentiating an
   intra-thyroid parathyroid adenoma from a thyroid nodule was 78% and 86%,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: Application of specific ultrasound criteria facilitates
   pre-operative diagnosis of intra-thyroid parathyroid adenomas and
   facilitates surgical planning. This large series confirms previous,
   largely anecdotal reports of ultrasound's utility in detecting
   intra-thyroid parathyroid adenomas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

TI Differential physiological responses to prey availability by the great
   egret and white Ibis
SO JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB In long-lived species, the balance between the benefits of reproduction
   and the costs from reduced survival or productivity is particularly
   challenging in dynamic environments like wetlands, where food levels
   vary greatly year to year. Some wetland species exhibit changes in
   reproductive strategies in response to food availability but whether
   physiological responses function in a similar manner is unclear. We
   compared the pre-breeding physiological responses (fecal corticosterone
   [FCORT], heat shock protein 60 [HSP60], and mass) of 2 species of wading
   birds with contrasting foraging strategies (great egret [Ardea alba], an
   exploiter, and white ibis [Eudocimus albus], a searcher) during years
   with contrasting levels of prey availability. Both species were in good
   physiological condition, with low levels of HSP60 and FCORT, during a
   year with high prey availability (2006). In a contrasting year with
   lesser prey availability (2007), HSP60 and FCORT concentrations
   indicated that ibis physiological condition was reduced, whereas egrets
   showed little change. Egrets and male ibis increased body mass, whereas
   female ibis decreased mass, in the year with low prey availability.
   Although poorly understood, we hypothesize that the differential
   response between female ibis and the others is associated with
   differential investment strategies based on long-term costs of
   reproduction. Model results identified prey availability and the 2-week
   water recession rate as the primary habitat variables that were
   associated with the physiological condition of white ibises, whereas
   great egret physiological condition was influenced mostly by 2-week
   water recession rate. Our results support the hypothesis that prey
   availability and hydrological factors play crucial roles in regulating
   populations of wading birds in the Florida Everglades. The results of
   this study show a more complete pathway by which hydrologic patterns
   affect wading birds, and it suggests that ibis are more sensitive to
   habitat conditions than are egrets. This information can be used to
   refine species models designed to evaluate water management scenarios
   and will improve our ability to manage and restore wetland ecosystems

TI Integrative annotation of chromatin elements from ENCODE data
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The ENCODE Project has generated a wealth of experimental information
   mapping diverse chromatin properties in several human cell lines.
   Although each such data track is independently informative toward the
   annotation of regulatory elements, their interrelations contain much
   richer information for the systematic annotation of regulatory elements.
   To uncover these interrelations and to generate an interpretable summary
   of the massive datasets of the ENCODE Project, we apply unsupervised
   learning methodologies, converting dozens of chromatin datasets into
   discrete annotation maps of regulatory regions and other chromatin
   elements across the human genome. These methods rediscover and summarize
   diverse aspects of chromatin architecture, elucidate the interplay
   between chromatin activity and RNA transcription, and reveal that a
   large proportion of the genome lies in a quiescent state, even across
   multiple cell types. The resulting annotation of non-coding regulatory
   elements correlate strongly with mammalian evolutionary constraint, and
   provide an unbiased approach for evaluating metrics of evolutionary
   constraint in human. Lastly, we use the regulatory annotations to
   revisit previously uncharacterized disease-associated loci, resulting in
   focused, testable hypotheses through the lens of the chromatin
   landscape.

TI Set9, NF-kappa B, and microRNA-21 mediate berberine-induced apoptosis of
   human multiple myeloma cells
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate the mechanisms by which berberine suppressed the
   proliferation of human multiple myeloma cells.
   Methods: Human U266 multiple myeloma cell line was tested. Cell
   proliferation, apoptosis, ultramicrostructure and secretion function
   were examined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), flow cytometry (FCM),
   electron and fluorescence microscopy, as well as ELISA assay. The
   microRNAs (miRs) and transcription factors in U266 cells were detected
   using arrays and verified by qRT-PCR. EMSA and luciferase assays were
   used to verify the p65-dependent transactivation of miR-21 gene.
   Results: Treatment of U266 cells with berberine (40-160 mu mol/L)
   suppressed cell proliferation and IL-6 secretion in dose- and
   time-dependent manners. Meanwhile, berberine dose-dependently induced
   ROS generation, G(2)/M phase arrest and apoptosis in U266 cells, and
   decreased the levels of miR-21 and Bcl-2. Overexpression of miR-21
   counteracted berberine-induced suppression,of cell proliferation and
   IL-6 secretion. In U266 cells treated with berberine (80 mu mol/L), the
   activity of NF-kappa B was decreased by approximately 50%, followed by
   significant reduction of miR-21 level. berberine (80-160 mu mol/L)
   increased the level of Set9 (lysine methyltransferase) by more than
   2-fold, caused methylation of the RelA subunit, which inhibited NF-kappa
   B nuclear translopation and miR-21 transcription. In U266 cells treated
   with berberine (80 mu mol/L), knockdown of Set9 with siRNAs
   significantly increased NF-kappa B protein level accompanying with a
   partial recovery of proliferation.
   Conclusion: In U266 cells, berberine suppresses NF-kappa B nuclear
   translocation via Set9-mediated lysine methylation, leads to decrease in
   the levels miR21 and Bcl-2, which induces ROS generation and apoptosis.

TI Alteration of Histone H3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation on Putative Lytic Gene
   Promoters by Human Set1 Complex during Reactivation of Kaposi's
   Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus
SO INTERVIROLOGY
AB Objective: Histone H3 lysine 4 is trimethylated by the human Set1
   complex, which regulates the activation of gene expression. The aim of
   this study was to identify whether the levels of histone H3 lysine 4
   trimethylation (H3K4me3) and the recruitment of human Set1 complex at
   the promoter regions of lytic genes quantitatively change during
   reactivation from latent to lytic infection of Kaposi's
   sarcoma-association herpesvirus (KSHV). Methods: During KSHV
   reactivation, global changes of H3K4 methylation in KSHV-infected cells
   were analyzed by Western blot. The relative levels of association
   between proteins and promoter regions were determined by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assay and quantitative real-time PCR using specific
   antibodies and primer sets. Results: Our results showed that KSHV
   reactivation does not alter the overall cellular levels of H3K4
   methylation. We observed that the switch from latency to lytic cycle
   leads to upregulation of H3K4me3 at the active lytic genes. We also
   found that the recruitment of RNA pol II and subunits of human Set1
   complex were enriched at the same regions in response to KSHV
   reactivation. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the increase of
   H3K4me3 by human Set1 complex is involved in activation of lytic genes
   during the lytic infection of KSHV. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG,

SO RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Progesterone and corticosterone are key modulators of the respiratory
   control system. While progesterone is widely recognized as an important
   respiratory stimulant in adult and newborn animals, much remains to be
   described regarding the underlying mechanisms. We review the potential
   implication of nuclear and membrane progesterone receptors in adults and
   in newborns. This raises intriguing questions regarding the contribution
   of progesterone as a protective factor against some respiratory control
   disorders during early life. We then discuss our current understanding
   of the central integration of stressful stimuli and the responses they
   elicit. The fact that this system interacts with the respiratory control
   system, either because both share some common neural pathways in the
   brainstem and hypothalamus, or because corticosterone directly modulates
   the function of the respiratory control network, is a fascinating field
   of research that has emerged over the past few years. Finally, we review
   the short- and long-term consequences of disruption of stress circuitry
   during postnatal development on these systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Relationship of Thyroid Function with Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in
   Euthyroid Tunisian Subjects
SO ENDOCRINE RESEARCH
AB Objectives. Although a relationship between obesity and metabolic
   consequences with thyroid function has been reported, the underlying
   pathogenesis is not completely known. In the current study, we evaluated
   the thyroid function in obese and/or diabetic patients compared to
   healthy normal weight peers, exploring the possible association between
   components of metabolic syndrome and thyroid function parameters.
   Methods. We recruited 108 subjects (56 male and 52 female). In all
   subjects, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4),
   fasting plasma levels of insulin and glucose, homeostasis model
   assessment for insulin resistance, and obesity parameters were assessed.
   Results. We found that circulating levels of TSH and FT4 were
   significantly increased in overweight and obese subjects. However, the
   data do not reveal any change of these hormones in diabetics.
   Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that TSH was directly
   associated with both obesity and insulin resistance parameters (p <
   0.05). FT4 was negatively associated only with obesity parameters (p <
   0.05). Conclusions. Our data strongly support that the changes of
   thyroid hormones may be influenced by adiposity and its metabolic
   consequences, such as insulin resistance. This relationship can be
   explained by a cross talk between adipose tissue release and thyroid
   function. Nevertheless, metformin treatment seems to affect thyroid
   function in diabetic patients by maintaining plasma thyrotropin levels
   to subnormal levels.

TI Development of the olfactory and vomeronasal organs in Discoglossus
   pictus (Discoglossidae, Anura)
SO JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY
AB Using histological techniques and computer-aided three-dimensional
   reconstructions of histological serial sections, we studied the
   development of the olfactory and vomeronasal organs in the discoglossid
   frog Discoglossus pictus. The olfactory epithelium in larval D. pictus
   represents one continuous unit of tissue not divided into two separate
   portions. However, a small pouch of olfactory epithelium (the
   ventromedial diverticulum) is embedded into the roof of the buccal
   cavity, anteromedial to the internal naris. The lateral appendix is
   present in D. pictus through the entire larval period and disappears
   during the onset of metamorphosis. The disappearance of the lateral
   appendix at this time suggests that it is a typical larval organ related
   to aquatic life. The vomeronasal organ develops during hindlimb
   development, which is comparatively late for anurans. The development of
   the vomeronasal organ in D. pictus follows the same general
   developmental pattern recognized for neobatrachians. As with most
   anurans, the vomeronasal glands appear later than the vomeronasal organ.
   After metamorphosis, the olfactory organ of adult D. pictus is composed
   of a series of three interconnected chambers: the cavum principale,
   cavum medium, and cavum inferius. We suggest that the ventromedial
   diverticulum at the anterior border of the internal naris of larval D.
   pictus might be homologous with the ventral olfactory epithelium of
   bufonids and with the similar diverticulum of Alytes. J. Morphol. 2013.

TI Neck ultrasonography as preoperative localization of primary
   hyperparathyroidism with an additional role of detecting thyroid
   malignancy
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Objective: To evaluate and compare the diagnostic performances of
   high-resolution ultrasonography and (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy for
   the preoperative localization of abnormal parathyroid glands and to
   evaluate the ability of US for additional diagnostic roles in detecting
   thyroid malignancy in patients with pHPT.
   Materials and methods: Preoperative localization images of 115
   parathyroid adenomas from high-resolution ultrasonography (US) and
   (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy (SS) were studied from 105 patients, who
   had undergone parathyroidectomy. Sensitivity, accuracy, and positive
   predictive value were calculated for the identification of adenomas in
   lesions and patients for both US and SS, respectively, and US and SS
   diagnostic performances were compared using generalized estimating
   equation.
   Results: Preoperative imaging by both modalities localized 105 (93.8%)
   of the 112 parathyroid lesions confirmed at surgery and histology.
   Sensitivity, accuracy, and positive predictive value were 93.1% and
   92.2%, 90.4% and 89.5%, and 96.9% and 96.9% by US and SS, respectively,
   without any statistically significant differences (P = 0.796, 0.796,
   0.879). US found incidental thyroid nodules in 47 patients (47/107,
   43.9%), and 7 patients (7/107, 6.5%) were confirmed to have malignancy
   based on pathology results (all had papillary thyroid carcinoma).
   Conclusion: Neck ultrasonography and (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy are
   complementary methods of the preoperative localization of parathyroid
   adenomas. Neck ultrasounds add an additional thyroid gland evaluation,
   and can be useful in the detection of incidental thyroid gland lesions,
   especially malignant nodules. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

TI Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA HOTAIR Is Overexpressed and Regulates PTEN
   Methylation in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Homeobox (HOX) transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is a long intergenic
   noncoding RNA (lincRNA) that is significantly overexpressed in breast
   and hepatocellular cancers. It remains unclear, however, whether HOTAIR
   plays an oncogenic role in human Laryngeal squamous cell cancer (LSCC).
   We therefore investigated the expression and functional role of HOTAIR
   in LSCC. HOTAIR levels were significantly higher in LSCC than in
   corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues, and patients with poor
   histological grade or advanced clinical stage had higher HOTAIR
   expression. Log-rank test showed a significant association between high
   Levels of HOTAIR and poor prognosis in LSCC patients. Multivariate Cox
   analysis suggested that HOTAIR is an independent prognostic factor of
   LSCC. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HOTAIR led to reduced invasion and
   increased apoptosis of Hep-2 cells in vitro and significantly reduced
   growth of LSCC xenograft tumors in mice. Moreover, PTEN methylation was
   significantly reduced in Hep-2 cells depleted of HOTAIR. Taken together,
   these results suggest that the oncogenic role of HOTAIR in LSCC is
   related to promotion of PTEN methylation. HOTAIR could serve as a marker
   for LSCC prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

TI Embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell: an epigenetic
   perspective
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB Pluripotent stem cells, like embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have
   specialized epigenetic landscapes, which are important for pluripotency
   maintenance. Transcription factor-mediated generation of induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) requires global change of somatic cell
   epigenetic status into an ESC-like state. Accumulating evidence
   indicates that epigenetic mechanisms not only play important roles in
   the iPSC generation process, but also affect the properties of
   reprogrammed iPSCs. Understanding the roles of various epigenetic
   factors in iPSC generation contributes to our knowledge of the
   reprogramming mechanisms.

TI Epigenetic silencing of WNT5A in Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric
   carcinoma
SO ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is responsible for the development of multiple
   tumors, including EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC), but little
   is known about its mechanisms in EBVaGC. WNT5A expression and promoter
   methylation were measured in 5 EBV-positive and 15 EBV-negative GC cell
   lines. The methylation status of 23 EBV-positive and 25 EBV-negative
   paired tumor/normal tissue samples was also examined. EBV-positive GC
   had no or very low expression of WNT5A but a high level of methylation
   in the promoter region. In contrast, EBV-negative GC had higher WNT5A
   expression and a lower level of promoter methylation. The reduced WNT5A
   expression could be restored by treatment with Aza, a methyltransferase
   inhibitor. Increased expression of WNT5A in vitro inhibited
   beta-catentin expression in EBVaGC cells (SNU719). These results suggest
   that hypermethylation of WNT5A induced by EBV may contribute to the
   development of EBVaGC. Ectopic introduction of WNT5A may have
   preventive/therapeutic potential for tumors with silenced WNT5A.

TI Comprehensive Methylome Characterization of Mycoplasma genitalium and
   Mycoplasma pneumoniae at Single-Base Resolution
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB In the bacterial world, methylation is most commonly associated with
   restriction-modification systems that provide a defense mechanism
   against invading foreign genomes. In addition, it is known that
   methylation plays functionally important roles, including timing of DNA
   replication, chromosome partitioning, DNA repair, and regulation of gene
   expression. However, full DNA methylome analyses are scarce due to a
   lack of a simple methodology for rapid and sensitive detection of common
   epigenetic marks (ie N(6)-methyladenine (6 mA) and N(4)-methylcytosine
   (4 mC)), in these organisms. Here, we use Single-Molecule Real-Time
   (SMRT) sequencing to determine the methylomes of two related human
   pathogen species, Mycoplasma genitalium G-37 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae
   M129, with single-base resolution. Our analysis identified two new
   methylation motifs not previously described in bacteria: a widespread 6
   mA methylation motif common to both bacteria (5'-CTAT-3'), as well as a
   more complex Type I m6A sequence motif in M. pneumoniae
   (5'-GAN(7)TAY-3'/3'-CTN(7)ATR-5'). We identify the methyltransferase
   responsible for the common motif and suggest the one involved in M.
   pneumoniae only. Analysis of the distribution of methylation sites
   across the genome of M. pneumoniae suggests a potential role for
   methylation in regulating the cell cycle, as well as in regulation of
   gene expression. To our knowledge, this is one of the first direct
   methylome profiling studies with single-base resolution from a bacterial
   organism.

TI Characterisation and validation of an enzyme-immunoassay for the
   non-invasive assessment of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in cheetahs
   (Acinonyx jubatus)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The non-invasive measurement of adrenocortical function in cheetahs is
   an important tool to assess stress in captive and free-ranging
   individuals, because stress has been suggested to be one of the causes
   of poor reproductive performance of captive cheetahs. We tested four
   enzyme immunoassays (EIA) in two captive cheetahs in Germany using
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges and identified the
   corticosterone-3-CMO EIA to be most sensitive to the increase in faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations after the ACTH
   challenge. This EIA performed also well in five captive cheetahs in
   South Africa. The fGCM concentrations across all seven cheetahs
   increased within 24 h by 681% compared to the baseline levels prior to
   ACTH. Storage of faecal samples at 0-4 degrees C did not strongly affect
   fGCM concentrations within 24 h, simplifying sample collection when
   immediate storage at 20 degrees C is not feasible. The two cheetahs in
   Germany also received an injection of [(3)H]cortisol to characterise
   fGCMs in faecal extracts using high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) immunograms. HPLC fractions were measured for their radioactivity
   and immunoreactive fGCM concentrations with the corticosterone-3-CMO
   EIA, respectively. The results revealed a polar peak of radiolabelled
   cortisol metabolites co-eluting with the major peak of immunoreactive
   fGCMs. Thus, our EIA measured substantial amounts of fGCMs corresponding
   to the radioactive peaks. The peaks were of higher polarity than native
   cortisol and corticosterone, suggesting that the metabolites were
   conjugated, which was confirmed by solvolysis of the HPLC fractions. Our
   results show that the corticosterone-3-CMO EIA is a reliable tool to
   assess fGCMs in cheetahs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Different methylation patterns in BWS/SRS cases clarified by MS-MLPA
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Molecular abnormalities in the 11p15.5 imprinted gene cluster lead to
   two different growth diseases: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and
   Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). They are mainly caused by epigenetic
   alterations in one of the two imprinting 11p15 control regions (ICR1 and
   ICR2). These CpG-rich regions are differentially methylated on the
   maternally and paternally derived chromosomes. We report four different
   methylation patterns along the BWS/SRS critical region, clarified by
   methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.
   The mathematical processing of the data provides information about
   alterations in the methylation status: from hypo- to almost complete
   demethylation of KvDMR, hypo- and hypermethylation of H19DMR and
   combined results from both regions provide information on paternal
   uniparental disomy (patUPD). The study concerns two BWS cases with KvDMR
   hypomethylation and almost complete loss of methylation, respectively;
   two patUPD11p15 cases with H19DMR hypermethylation/KvDMR
   hypomethylation, and one SRS case with H19DMR demethylation. In some
   cases KvDMR hypomethylation in patUPD11p15 can be difficult to assess,
   which requires combination with STR analysis or alternative method. The
   STR analysis provides also information on complete or segmental coverage
   and iso- or heterodisomy. Following this systematic approach, the
   precise diagnosis can be clarified in a few days and different
   methylation patterns could be detected.

TI Sleep Disturbance and Incidence of Thyroid Cancer in Postmenopausal
   Women The Women's Health Initiative
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Sleep disturbance has been found to be associated with numerous adverse
   health outcomes, including cancers. However, no epidemiologic study has
   examined the relation between sleep disturbance and thyroid cancer risk.
   A total of 142,933 postmenopausal women who were 5079 years of age and
   enrolled in the Womens Health Initiative between September 1, 1993, and
   December 31, 1998, were followed up for a mean of 11 years. Cox
   proportional-hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard
   ratios and 95 confidence intervals for sleep disturbance (insomnia and
   sleep duration) and risk of thyroid cancer. Insomnia score was measured
   using a validated 5-item Womens Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale.
   Overall, a total of 295 thyroid cancer cases were identified. After
   adjustment for potential confounders, women with greater insomnia scores
   had a significantly higher risk of thyroid cancer than did women with
   low scores (hazard ratio 1.44, 95 confidence interval: 1.01, 2.05). The
   significant association between insomnia score and thyroid cancer was
   confined to nonobese women (hazard ratio 1.71, 95 confidence interval:
   1.12, 2.62) and was not seen in obese women (hazard ratio 0.94 95
   confidence interval: 0.48, 1.84) (P for interaction 0.07). In
   conclusion, postmenopausal women with greater insomnia scores,
   especially nonobese women, had a significantly increased risk of thyroid
   cancer. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.

TI Hepatitis B virus X protein modulates remodelling of minichromosomes
   related to hepatitis B virus replication in HepG2 cells
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is
   organised into minichromosomes by histone and non-histone proteins.
   Remodelling of minichromosomes is crucial for the regulation of HBV
   replication, which is dependent on the presence of the hepatitis B virus
   X protein (HBx). However, the mechanisms of HBx-dependent HBV
   replication remain obscure. The objective of this study was to
   investigate the mechanism of HBx-dependent HBV replication through the
   pathway of chromatin remodelling. The role of HBx was investigated by
   transfecting human HepG2 cells with the linear full-length HBV genome
   (wild-type) or HBx-deficient mutant HBV DNA (HBx mutant). Our results
   showed that although the formation of cccDNA was not affected by HBx,
   HBV replication, transcription and antigen secretion were all
   significantly reduced, resulting from the absence of HBx. The
   acetylation, mono-methylation and phosphorylation of cccDNA-bound
   histone H3 were associated with HBV replication. In addition, the levels
   of cccDNA-bound methylated, phosphorylated and acetylated histone H3
   decreased sharply in HBx mutant HBV DNA. HBx modulated not only the
   status of acetylation but also the methylation and phosphorylation of
   histone H3 bound to the cccDNA during HBV replication in HepG2 cells.
   These findings suggest that HBx plays an important role in modulating
   the remodelling of minichromosomes related to HBV replication and it may
   regulate viral replication through the pathway of chromatin remodelling.

TI Triclosan reduces the levels of global DNA methylation in HepG2 cells
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Triclosan (TCS), an antibacterial agent, is widely used in a variety of
   personal care and industrial products. TCS is associated with the
   development of liver tumors in rodents and has become a concern to
   environmental and human health. This study is aimed at investigating
   whether TCS could modulate the levels of global DNA methylation (GDM) in
   human hepatocytes. We found that treatment with different doses (1.25-10
   mu M) of TCS did not affect HepG2 cell viability, but significantly
   reduced the levels of GDM in HepG2 cells, and inhibited DNMT1 activity.
   Furthermore, treatment with TCS significantly inhibited the methylated
   DNA-binding domain 2 (MBD2), MBD3, and MeCP2 mRNA transcription. In
   addition, treatment with TCS promoted the accumulation of
   8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in a dose-dependent manner, which
   was abrogated by treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
   Collectively, our data indicated that TCS reduced the levels of GDM and
   down-regulated the MBD2, MBD3, and MeCP2 gene expression by increasing
   8-OHdG levels and inhibiting the DNMT1 activity in HepG2 cells. (C) 2012

TI Bone metastatic process of breast cancer involves methylation state
   affecting E-cadherin expression through TAZ and WWOX nuclear effectors
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB We investigated the involvement of Hippo-related pathways in bone
   metastasis from breast cancer, by evaluating E-cadherin expression
   downstream of WWdomain-containing oxidoreductase (Wwox) and
   transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). These nuclear
   effectors functioned in a context-specific fashion on transcriptome,
   depending on breast-cancer aggressiveness and methylation state. Wwox
   and E-cadherin were found in human specimens of bone metastasis but not
   in primary-ductal breast carcinoma, while TAZ showed a characteristic
   localisation in metastasis nuclei. Wwox and E-cadherin were higher in
   1833-metastatic clone with bone avidity than in parental-MDA-MB231
   cells, while only metastatic cells presented TAZ. In 1833 cells, a
   complex interplay of transcriptional signalling controlled E-cadherin
   transactivation. Wwox and TAZ activated Hypoxia inducible factor-1
   (HIF-1) binding to E-cadherin promoter, while Peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) intervened in
   E-cadherin transactivation favouring and preventing Wwox and TAZ
   functions, respectively. Methylation impinged on Hippo-related pathways
   through Wwox and TAZ, modifying metastatic phenotype. The protract
   exposure to 5-azacytidine (Aza), by affecting methylation state modified
   the shape of 1833 cells, becoming mesenchymal as that of MDA-MB231 cells
   and reduced spontaneous-Matrigel invasion. The underlying-molecular
   mechanisms were diminutions of E-cadherin, Wwox, matrix metalloproteases
   2 and 9, HIF-1- and PPAR gamma-activities, inversely correlated to Snail
   and nuclear-TAZ accumulations. Exogenous WWOX restored 1833-Aza
   invasion. Thus, 1833-Aza cells permitted to study the role played by
   methylation in metastasis plasticity, being E-cadherin loss part of an
   entire-gene reprogramming. Of note, bone-metastasis formation in
   1833-Aza xenograft was partially impaired, prolonging mice survival. In
   conclusion, the methylation-heritable changes seemed important for
   cancer progression to establish bone metastasis engraftment/growth, by
   affecting steps requiring homotipic and/or heterotypic-adhesive
   properties and matrix degradation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Histone Regulation in the CNS: Basic Principles of Epigenetic Plasticity
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Postmitotic neurons are subject to a vast array of environmental
   influences that require the nuclear integration of intracellular
   signaling events to promote a wide variety of neuroplastic states
   associated with synaptic function, circuit formation, and behavioral
   memory. Over the last decade, much attention has been paid to the roles
   of transcription and chromatin regulation in guiding fundamental aspects
   of neuronal function. A great deal of this work has centered on
   neurodevelopmental and adulthood plasticity, with increased focus in the
   areas of neuropharmacology and molecular psychiatry. Here, we attempt to
   provide a broad overview of chromatin regulation, as it relates to
   central nervous system (CNS) function, with specific emphasis on the
   modes of histone posttranslational modifications, chromatin remodeling,
   and histone variant exchange. Understanding the functions of chromatin
   in the context of the CNS will aid in the future development of
   pharmacological therapeutics aimed at alleviating devastating
   neurological disorders. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews (2013) 38, 3-22;

TI Inhibition of Yersinia pestis DNA adenine methyltransferase in vitro by
   a stibonic acid compound: identification of a potential novel class of
   antimicrobial agents
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Background and Purpose Multiple antibiotic resistant strains of plague
   are emerging, driving a need for the development of novel antibiotics
   effective against Yersinia pestis. DNA adenine methylation regulates
   numerous fundamental processes in bacteria and alteration of DNA adenine
   methlytransferase (Dam) expression is attenuating for several pathogens,
   including Y. pestis. The lack of a functionally similar enzyme in humans
   makes Dam a suitable target for development of novel therapeutics for
   plague. Experimental Approach Compounds were evaluated for their ability
   to inhibit Dam activity in a high-throughput screening assay. DNA was
   isolated from Yersinia grown in the presence of lead compounds and
   restricted to determine the effect of inhibitors on DNA methylation.
   Transcriptional analysis was undertaken to determine the effect of an
   active inhibitor on virulence-associated phenotypes. Key Results We have
   identified a series of aryl stibonic acids which inhibit Dam in vitro.
   The most active, 4-stibonobenzenesulfonic acid, exhibited a competitive
   mode of inhibition with respect to DNA and a Ki of 6.46 nM. One compound
   was found to inhibit DNA methylation in cultured Y. pestis. The effects
   of this inhibition on the physiology of the cell were widespread, and
   included altered expression of known virulence traits, including iron
   acquisition and Type III secretion. Conclusions and Implications We have
   identified a novel class of potent Dam inhibitors. Treatment of
   bacterial cell cultures with these inhibitors resulted in a decrease in
   DNA methylation. Expression of virulence factors was affected,
   suggesting these inhibitors may attenuate bacterial infectivity and
   function as antibiotics.

TI Chromatin diminution in the copepod Mesocyclops edax: elimination of
   both highly repetitive and nonhighly repetitive DNA
SO GENOME
AB Chromatin diminution, a developmentally regulated process of DNA
   elimination, is found in numerous eukaryotic species. In the copepod
   Mesocyclops edax, some 90% of its genomic DNA is eliminated during the
   differentiation of embryonic cells into somatic cells. Previous studies
   have shown that the eliminated DNA contains highly repetitive sequences.
   Here, we sequenced DNA fragments from pre- and postdiminution cells to
   determine whether nonhighly repetitive sequences are also eliminated
   during the process of chromatin diminution. Comparative analyses of
   these sequences, as well as the sequences eliminated from the genome of
   the copepod Cyclops kolensis, show that they all share similar
   abundances of tandem repeats, dispersed repeats, transposable elements,
   and various coding and noncoding sequences. This suggests that, in the
   chromatin diminution observed in M. edax, both highly repetitive and
   nonhighly repetitive sequences are eliminated and that there is no bias
   in the type of nonhighly repetitive DNA being eliminated.

TI Thyrotropin-Blocking Autoantibodies and Thyroid-Stimulating
   Autoantibodies: Potential Mechanisms Involved in the Pendulum Swinging
   from Hypothyroidism to Hyperthyroidism or Vice Versa
SO THYROID
AB Background: Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) antibodies that stimulate the
   thyroid (TSAb) cause Graves' hyperthyroidism and TSHR antibodies which
   block thyrotropin action (TBAb) are occasionally responsible for
   hypothyroidism. Unusual patients switch from TSAb to TBAb (or vice
   versa) with concomitant thyroid function changes. We have examined case
   reports to obtain insight into the basis for "switching."
   Summary: TBAb to TSAb switching occurs in patients treated with
   levothyroxine (LT4); the reverse switch (TBAb to TSAb) occurs after
   anti-thyroid drug therapy; TSAb/TBAb alterations may occur during
   pregnancy and are well recognized in transient neonatal thyroid
   dysfunction. Factors that may impact the shift include: (i) LT4
   treatment, usually associated with decreased thyroid autoantibodies, in
   unusual patients induces or enhances thyroid autoantibody levels; (ii)
   antithyroid drug treatment decreases thyroid autoantibody levels; (iii)
   hyperthyroidism can polarize antigen-presenting cells, leading to
   impaired development of regulatory T cells, thereby compromising control
   of autoimmunity; (iv) immune-suppression/hemodilution reduces thyroid
   autoantibodies during pregnancy and rebounds postpartum; (v) maternally
   transferred IgG transiently impacts thyroid function in neonates until
   metabolized; (vi) a Graves' disease model involving immunizing
   TSHR-knockout mice with mouse TSHR-adenovirus and transfer of TSHR
   antibody-secreting splenocytes to athymic mice demonstrates the TSAb to
   TBAb shift, paralleling the outcome of maternally transferred "term
   limited" TSHR antibodies in neonates. Finally, perhaps most important,
   as illustrated by dilution analyses of patients' sera in vitro, TSHR
   antibody concentrations and affinities play a critical role in switching
   TSAb and TBAb functional activities in vivo.
   Conclusions: Switching between TBAb and TSAb (or vice versa) occurs in
   unusual patients after LT4 therapy for hypothyroidism or anti-thyroid
   drug treatment for Graves' disease. These changes involve differences in
   TSAb versus TBAb concentrations, affinities and/or potencies in
   individual patients. Thus, anti-thyroid drugs or
   suppression/hemodilution in pregnancy reduce initially low TSAb levels
   even further, leading to TBAb dominance. In contrast, TSAb emergence
   after LT4 administration may be sufficient to counteract TBAb
   inhibition. The occurrence of "switching" emphasizes the need for
   careful patient monitoring and management. Finally, whole genome
   screening of relatively rare "switch" patients and appropriate Graves'
   and Hashimoto's controls could provide unexpected and valuable
   information regarding the basis for thyroid autoimmunity.

TI Recovering ensembles of chromatin conformations from contact
   probabilities
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The 3D higher order organization of chromatin within the nucleus of
   eukaryotic cells has so far remained elusive. A wealth of relevant
   information, however, is increasingly becoming available from chromosome
   conformation capture (3C) and related experimental techniques, which
   measure the probabilities of contact between large numbers of genomic
   sites in fixed cells. Such contact probabilities (CPs) can in principle
   be used to deduce the 3D spatial organization of chromatin. Here, we
   propose a computational method to recover an ensemble of chromatin
   conformations consistent with a set of given CPs. Compared with existing
   alternatives, this method does not require conversion of CPs to mean
   spatial distances. Instead, we estimate CPs by simulating a physically
   realistic, bead-chain polymer model of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. We
   then use an approach from adaptive filter theory to iteratively adjust
   the parameters of this polymer model until the estimated CPs match the
   given CPs. We have validated this method against reference data sets
   obtained from simulations of test systems with up to 45 beads and 4
   loops. With additional testing against experiments and with further
   algorithmic refinements, our approach could become a valuable tool for
   researchers examining the higher order organization of chromatin.

TI NIPP1 maintains EZH2 phosphorylation and promoter occupancy at
   proliferation-related target genes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The histone methyltransferase EZH2 regulates cell proliferation and
   differentiation by silencing Polycomb group target genes. NIPP1, a
   nuclear regulator of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), has
   been implicated in the regulation of EZH2 occupancy at target loci, but
   the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that
   the phosphorylation of EZH2 by cyclin-dependent kinases at Thr416
   creates a docking site for the ForkHead-associated domain of NIPP1.
   Recruited NIPP1 enables the net phosphorylation of EZH2 by inhibiting
   its dephosphorylation by PP1. Accordingly, a NIPP1-binding mutant of
   EZH2 is hypophosphorylated, and the knockdown of NIPP1 results in a
   reduced phosphorylation of endogenous EZH2. Conversely, the loss of PP1
   is associated with a hyperphosphorylation of EZH2. A genome-wide
   promoter-binding profiling in HeLa cells revealed that the NIPP1-binding
   mutant shows a deficient association with about a third of the Polycomb
   target genes, and these are enriched for functions in proliferation. Our
   data identify PP1 as an EZH2 phosphatase and demonstrate that the
   phosphorylation-regulated association of EZH2 with proliferation-related
   targets depends on associated NIPP1.

TI Changes of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in plant protoplast

   regulation. Along with 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), a newly discovered

   in plant protoplast DNA and demonstrated its increasing content during
   the first 72 hrs. of protoplast cultivation. In contrast to 5-hmC, the
   amount of 5-mC decreased during protoplast cultivation. It was also

TI DNA methylome signature in rheumatoid arthritis
SO ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES
AB Objectives Epigenetics can influence disease susceptibility and
   severity. While DNA methylation of individual genes has been explored in
   autoimmunity, no unbiased systematic analyses have been reported.
   Therefore, a genome-wide evaluation of DNA methylation loci in
   fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) isolated from the site of disease in
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was performed.
   Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from six RA and five osteoarthritis
   (OA) FLS lines and evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450
   chip. Cluster analysis of data was performed and corrected using
   Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons. Methylation was
   confirmed by pyrosequencing and gene expression was determined by qPCR.
   Pathway analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes.
   Results RA and control FLS segregated based on DNA methylation, with
   1859 differentially methylated loci. Hypomethylated loci were identified
   in key genes relevant to RA, such as CHI3L1, CASP1, STAT3, MAP3K5, MEFV
   and WISP3. Hypermethylation was also observed, including TGFBR2 and
   FOXO1. Hypomethylation of individual genes was associated with increased
   gene expression. Grouped analysis identified 207 hypermethylated or
   hypomethylated genes with multiple differentially methylated loci,
   including COL1A1, MEFV and TNF. Hypomethylation was increased in
   multiple pathways related to cell migration, including focal adhesion,
   cell adhesion, transendothelial migration and extracellular matrix
   interactions. Confirmatory studies with OA and normal FLS also
   demonstrated segregation of RA from control FLS based on methylation
   pattern.
   Conclusions Differentially methylated genes could alter FLS gene
   expression and contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. DNA methylation of
   critical genes suggests that RA FLS are imprinted and implicate
   epigenetic contributions to inflammatory arthritis.

TI Delayed Temporal Increase of Hepatic Hsp70 in ApoE Knockout Mice After
   Prenatal Arsenic Exposure
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Prenatal arsenic exposure accelerates atherosclerosis in ApoE(/) mice by
   unknown mechanism. Arsenic is a hepatotoxicant, and liver disease
   increases atherosclerosis risk. Prenatal arsenic exposure may predispose
   to liver disease by priming for susceptibility to other environmental
   insults. Earlier microarray analyses showed prenatal arsenic exposure
   increased Hsc70 (HspA8) and Hsp70 (HspA1a) mRNAs in livers of
   10-week-old mice. We determined effects of prenatal arsenic exposure on
   hepatic Hsp70 and Hsc70 expression by Western blot and on DNA
   methylation by methyl acceptance assay during prenatal and postnatal
   development. Pregnant ApoE(/) mice were given drinking water containing
   85mg/l NaAsO(2) (49 ppm arsenic) from gestation day (GD) 8 to 18. Hsp70
   and Hsc70 expression and DNA methylation were determined in GD18 fetuses
   and 3-, 10-, and 24-week-old mice. Hsc70 expression was unchanged at all
   ages. Hsp70 induction was observed at 3 and 10 weeks, but was unchanged
   in GD18 fetuses and 24-week livers of mice. Global DNA methylation
   increased with age; arsenic had no effects. Bisulfite sequencing of DNA
   from livers of 10-week-old mice showed Hsp70 promoter region methylation
   was unchanged, but methylation was increased within the transcribed
   region. Hsf1 and Nrf2 nuclear translocation were investigated as
   potential mechanisms of Hsp70 induction and found unaltered. Putative
   binding sites were identified in HSP70 for in utero arsenic
   exposure-suppressed microRNAs suggesting a possible mechanism. Thus,
   prenatal arsenic exposure causes delayed temporal hepatic Hsp70
   induction, suggesting a transient state of stress in livers which can
   predispose the mice to developing liver disease.

TI Suv4-20h Histone Methyltransferases Promote Neuroectodermal
   Differentiation by Silencing the Pluripotency-Associated Oct-25 Gene
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones exert fundamental
   roles in regulating gene expression. During development, groups of PTMs
   are constrained by unknown mechanisms into combinatorial patterns, which
   facilitate transitions from uncommitted embryonic cells into
   differentiated somatic cell lineages. Repressive histone modifications
   such as H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 have been investigated in detail, but the
   role of H4K20me3 in development is currently unknown. Here we show that
   Xenopus laevis Suv4-20h1 and h2 histone methyltransferases (HMTases) are
   essential for induction and differentiation of the neuroectoderm.
   Morpholino-mediated knockdown of the two HMTases leads to a selective
   and specific downregulation of genes controlling neural induction,
   thereby effectively blocking differentiation of the neuroectoderm.
   Global transcriptome analysis supports the notion that these effects
   arise from the transcriptional deregulation of specific genes rather
   than widespread, pleiotropic effects. Interestingly, morphant embryos
   fail to repress the Oct4-related Xenopus gene Oct-25. We validate Oct-25
   as a direct target of xSu4-20h enzyme mediated gene repression, showing
   by chromatin immunoprecipitaton that it is decorated with the H4K20me3
   mark downstream of the promoter in normal, but not in double-morphant,
   embryos. Since knockdown of Oct-25 protein significantly rescues the
   neural differentiation defect in xSuv4-20h double-morphant embryos, we
   conclude that the epistatic relationship between Suv4-20h enzymes and
   Oct-25 controls the transit from pluripotent to
   differentiation-competent neural cells. Consistent with these results in
   Xenopus, murine Suv4-20h1/h2 double-knockout embryonic stem (DKO ES)
   cells exhibit increased Oct4 protein levels before and during EB
   formation, and reveal a compromised and biased capacity for in vitro
   differentiation, when compared to normal ES cells. Together, these
   results suggest a regulatory mechanism, conserved between amphibians and
   mammals, in which H4K20me3-dependent restriction of specific POU-V genes
   directs cell fate decisions, when embryonic cells exit the pluripotent
   state.

TI Perinatal manipulation of alpha-linolenic acid intake induces epigenetic
   changes in maternal and offspring livers
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB Previous studies indicated that the intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)
   can alter the concentration of both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in
   both mother and offspring, with consequences on postnatal brain
   development. This study describes the association between maternal ALA
   availability during gestation and lactation, and alterations in the
   Fads2 DNA methylation in both maternal and offspring livers, at the end
   of lactation period. Both Fads2 promoter and intron 1 DNA methylation
   were increased in the groups receiving postnatal flaxseed oil containing
   50% ALA (mothers or pups), while bivariate analysis indicated a
   significant association of the Fads2 epigenetic status in the liver
   between each mother and its offspring. In addition, Fads2 expression was
   negatively correlated with promoter methylation at the individual level
   in maternal livers (P<0.05). This study also indicated that the
   interplay between ALA availability during gestation and lactation can
   differentially alter the expression of desaturases and elongases
   involved in omega-6 and omega-3 metabolic pathways. In summary, when
   considering the perinatal dietary ALA requirements in mice, both
   gestation and lactation periods should be considered as having distinct
   roles in modulating the metabolism of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in
   maternal mouse livers.-Niculescu, M. D., Lupu, D. S., Craciunescu, C. N.

TI Thyroid hormones for acute kidney injury
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   Acute kidney injury (AKI), which is common in hospitalised patients, is
   associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent
   advances in treatment, AKI outcomes have not changed substantially
   during the past four decades, and incidence is increasing. There is an
   urgent need to explore novel therapeutic agents and revisit some older
   drugs to review their roles in the management of AKI. Although thyroid
   hormone therapy has shown promise in experimental animal studies,
   clinical efficacy and safety have not been systematically assessed for
   the management of people with AKI.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for the treatment
   of hospitalised adults with AKI of any aetiology.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL,
   MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved
   studies and articles.
   Date of search: November 2012
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (in which allocation
   to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical
   records, date of birth or other predictable methods) that compared any
   dose or form of thyroid hormone therapy alone or in combination with
   other agents compared with placebo or supplemental treatment (such as
   furosemide, dopamine, or atrial natriuretic peptide) in adult AKI
   patients.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. The
   quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane
   Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool. For dichotomous outcomes
   (death, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), progression to
   end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), we planned to express results as risk
   ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales
   of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (length of
   hospital stay, durations of AKI and RRT), we planned to use the mean
   difference (MD).
   Main results
   Two studies, enrolling 97 participants, met our inclusion criteria. The
   studies differed significantly in terms of study populations, natural
   history of AKI (multifactorial AKI in patients with native kidneys
   versus delayed graft function associated with acute tubular necrosis in
   transplant recipients), and study interventions; hence, data were not
   meta-analysed. One study reported a significant increase in the risk of
   all-cause mortality associated with thyroid hormone interventions
   compared with placebo (59 participants, RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.21 to 9.12);
   no deaths were reported in the other study. Both studies reported no
   significant difference in the need for RRT associated with thyroid
   hormone therapy when compared to placebo. Neither study reported
   incidence of progression to ESKD. There was a significantly longer
   duration of AKI (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.82) and RRT (5.00 days,
   95% CI 2.05 to 7.95) associated with thyroid hormone therapy compared
   with placebo in one study; no differences in durations of AKI (MD 2.00
   days, 95% CI -3.53 to 7.53) and RRT (MD 2.00 days, 95% CI -2.36 to 6.36)
   were noted in the other study. One study reported similar lengths of
   stay in the intensive care unit and hospital in both intervention and
   control arms (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -8.17 to 7.77); the other did not
   report this outcome. No adverse events were noted to be associated with
   thyroid hormone therapy in either study. Adequate data were not
   available to assess changes in kidney function or numbers of RRT
   sessions. Both included studies were small and methodological quality
   was suboptimal.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found a paucity of large, high quality studies to inform analysis of
   thyroid hormone interventions for the treatment of people with AKI.
   Current evidence suggested that thyroid hormone therapy may be
   associated with worse outcomes for patients with established AKI;
   therefore, its use for these patients should be avoided. The role of
   thyroid hormone therapy in preventing AKI has not been adequately
   investigated and may be considered in future clinical studies.

   detect and quantify tumor-derived DNA in the serum of HCC patients.
   Methods: Aberrant methylation of the APC gene was quantified in 23 HCC
   patients and 8 healthy volunteers using 100 mu l of serum. For sensitive
   detection and accurate quantification of tumor DNA, we combined
   seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TaqMan PCR, which could
   amplify the APC gene regardless of the methylation status and detect the
   methylated and unmethylated sequences separately. The ratio of
   methylated to unmethylated sequences was quantified. Results: The
   methylated APC gene was detected in all HCC patients examined, but no
   healthy volunteers showed amplification of methylated sequences in
   serum. HCC patients with portal vein thrombosis showed a significantly
   higher methylated to unmethylated APC gene ratio in serum than those
   without portal vein thrombosis (p = 0.0029). Conclusions: Considering
   the strong association between the ratio of the methylated to
   unmethylated APC sequences in serum and the presence of portal vein
   thrombosis, methylation status of APC sequences could be a promising
   marker for improving HCC management. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG,

TI Influence of benthic macrofauna on microbial production of methylmercury
   in sediments on the New England continental shelf
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Microbial methylation processes in sediment are an important source of
   toxic monomethylmercury (MMHg) to aquatic ecosystems. Although
   bioturbation activities (feeding, digging of galleries, excavations,
   bioirrigation) by benthic fauna are known to affect many biogeochemical
   processes, their influence on benthic MMHg production is poorly
   understood. We investigated the effect of benthic fauna on the microbial
   production of MMHg in sediments on the continental shelf of the
   northwest Atlantic Ocean in September 2009. Replicate cores of sieved
   (control) and unaltered sediment containing native macrofauna were
   incubated to examine the influence of benthic macrofauna on net MMHg
   production, potential gross rates of Hg methylation, sediment reworking,
   dissolved oxygen and organic carbon concentrations, and microbial
   metabolic activities. The presence of macrofauna stimulated aerobic
   microbial respiration and net MMHg production, but had no observed
   effect on short-term gross rates of Hg methylation. This suggests that
   bioturbation may promote net MMHg production by inhibiting demethylating
   microorganisms, although overall community metabolism was increased.
   Results from this work emphasize the need to enhance our knowledge and
   understanding of the interactions among benthic fauna, microorganisms,
   and geochemistry in affecting MMHg production.

TI Subtype-specific parafollicular localization of the neuropeptide
   manserin in the rat thyroid gland
SO ACTA HISTOCHEMICA
AB The thyroid gland is an endocrine organ which is involved in metabolism,
   neuroexcitability, body growth and development. The thyroid gland is
   also involved in the regulation of calcium metabolism, which is not yet
   fully understood. In this study, we investigated the localization of the
   granin-derived neuropeptide, manserin, in the adult rat thyroid gland.
   Manserin immunoreactivity was detected in thyroid follicular epithelial
   cells. Intense manserin signals were also detected in some, but not all,
   parafollicular cells, indicating that parafollicular manserin may be
   subtype-specific. These results indicate that thyroid manserin may play
   pivotal roles in parafollicular cells and follicular epithelial cells
   such as in calcium metabolism and/or thyroid hormone secretion. (C) 2012

TI Malignant Pleural Effusion Resulting from Metastasis of Thyroid
   Primaries: A Cytomorphological Analysis
SO ACTA CYTOLOGICA
AB Background: Malignant serous cavity effusion caused by primary thyroid
   cancer is extremely rare in routine clinical practice. Therefore, it is
   often not included in the differential diagnostic workup of patients
   presenting with positive effusion cytology. Methods: The clinical
   features were reviewed for 6 patients seen at our institution over the
   last 26 years for malignant effusion resulting from metastatic thyroid
   cancer. The cytomorphology from 4 of these cases was also reviewed.
   Results: All of the patients found in this study presented with
   malignant pleural effusion other serous cavity effusions resulting from
   metastatic thyroid carcinoma were not seen. These comprised 0.25% of all
   patients with a known history of thyroid carcinoma and 0.67% of all
   malignant pleural effusions. One patient had a history of bone
   metastases, but all the others had no pathological evidence of distant
   metastatic disease prior to the pleural effusion. Conclusions: Malignant
   pleural effusion rarely results from a thyroid carcinoma after some
   latency. The diagnosis requires immunohistochemical staining as well as
   the pertinent clinical context. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Usefulness of plasma epigenetic changes of five major genes involved in
   the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB The purpose of present study was to investigate the methylation status
   of the promoter region in five genes (mothers against decapentaplegic
   homolog 4, fragile histidine triad protein, death-associated protein
   kinase 1, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and E-cadherin), which are
   known to be involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and
   its clinicopathological significance.
   The study subjects were 60 CRC patients, 40 patients with adenomatous
   colorectal polyp and 60 healthy control individuals. We further enrolled
   a total of 16 patients (two patients with Crohn's disease, two patients
   with ulcerative colitis, one patient with serrated adenoma, and 11
   patients with colorectal cancer). The methylation states of the five
   genes were determined in peripheral blood plasma using
   methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction single-strand
   conformation polymorphism analysis.
   This study showed the most sensitive epigenetic markers, E-cadherin (60
   %), followed by APC (57 %), for detecting CRC. E-cadherin and APC had
   similar specificities and amplified 84 and 86 %, respectively, of CRC
   patients compared to non-CRC patients. Additionally, APC was the only
   marker to be significantly increased (OR = 6.67, 95 % CI = 1.19-23.4, P
   = 0.045) and the most sensitive (57 %) and specific (89 %) marker in
   stage I CRC. Though we have not examined the paired cancer tissues and
   plasma, there was relatively high concordant rate (60-80 %) in our
   limited number of colorectal cancer patients.
   Five genes, promoter methylation, in plasma were statistically
   significant risk factors in CRC patients. In this study, E-cad and APC
   genes may be particularly useful epigenetic biomarkers in plasma for the
   detection of CRC. Additionally, APC may able to identify early potential
   CRC.

TI Cerebellar Abnormalities in Mice Lacking Type 3 Deiodinase and Partial
   Reversal of Phenotype by Deletion of Thyroid Hormone Receptor alpha 1
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Thyroid hormone serves many functions throughout brain development, but
   the mechanisms that control the timing of its actions in specific brain
   regions are poorly understood. In the cerebellum, thyroid hormone
   controls formation of the transient external germinal layer, which
   contains proliferative granule cell precursors, subsequent granule cell
   migration, and cerebellar foliation. We report that the thyroid
   hormone-inactivating type 3 deiodinase (encoded by Dio3) is expressed in
   the mouse cerebellum at embryonic and neonatal stages, suggesting a need
   to protect cerebellar tissues from premature stimulation by thyroid
   hormone. Dio3(-/-) mice displayed reduced foliation, accelerated
   disappearance of the external germinal layer, and premature expansion of
   the molecular layer at juvenile ages. Furthermore, Dio3(-/-) mice
   exhibited locomotor behavioral abnormalities and impaired ability in
   descending a vertical pole. To ascertain that these phenotypes resulted
   from inappropriate exposure to thyroid hormone, thyroid hormone receptor
   alpha 1 (TR alpha 1) was removed from Dio3(-/-) mice, which
   substantially corrected the cerebellar and behavioral phenotypes.
   Deletion of TR alpha 1 did not correct the previously reported small
   thyroid gland or deafness in Dio3(-/-) mice, indicating that Dio3
   controls the activation of specific receptor isoforms in different
   tissues. These findings suggest that type 3 deiodinase constrains the
   timing of thyroid hormone action during cerebellar development.

TI PDCD4 expression in thyroid neoplasia
SO VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
AB Both the morphogenesis and the molecular pathways of thyroid cancers are
   controversial. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor
   gene whose expression is controlled by miR-21. By applying
   immunohistochemistry for PDCD4 and both quantitative real-time PCR
   (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization formiR-21, this study explored PDCD4
   expression in human follicular-cell-derived thyroid neoplastic lesions.
   PDCD4 protein expression was semiquantitatively assessed in 100
   consecutive thyroid tumors (25 follicular adenomas (FA), 25 follicular
   carcinomas (FC), 25 papillary carcinomas (PC), and 25
   poorly-differentiated/anaplastic cancers (PD-AC)). Twenty-five
   additional nonneoplastic thyroid tissue samples were included as
   controls. To further support the data, miR-21 expression was tested (by
   qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization) in a different series of 75 cases (15
   FAs, 15 FCs, 15 PCs, 15 PD-ACs, and 15 controls). Nonneoplastic
   thyrocytes consistently featured a strong nuclear PDCD4 expression,
   while the protein's expression was significantly downregulated in
   neoplastic epithelia. PDCD4 downregulation was significantly associated
   with less well-differentiated cancer phenotypes (p<0.001) and more
   advanced tumor stages (p<0.001). Consistently with PDCD4 downregulation,
   miR-21 was upregulated in neoplastic by comparison with nonneoplastic
   tissue samples. The present results provide evidence of PDCD4 having a
   role in thyroid carcinogenesis; further studies should investigate the
   diagnostic value and the prognostic impact of PDCD4 in thyroid
   neoplasia.

TI Localized Amyloid in Thyroid: Are We Missing It?
SO ADVANCES IN ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY
AB When present in thyroid, amyloid is an attribute almost always
   restricted to medullary thyroid carcinoma. Scant studies in the
   literature have demonstrated this finding in other thyroid pathologies
   as papillary thyroid carcinoma, amyloid goiter, and other benign
   entities. From our experience in thyroid pathology, we analyzed cases on
   which the stroma contained deposits of amorphous, acellular, and
   eosinophilic material characteristic of amyloid. Congo red stain on
   suspicious cases was performed; clinicopathologic investigation was done
   when results were positive. Seven patients with amyloid infiltration in
   the thyroid, in association with papillary thyroid carcinoma, and in 4
   cases of benign pathologies were found in our own review. The
   association of amyloid and thyroid is discussed herein, including cases
   of systemic amyloidosis, malignancies, benign diseases, and thyroid
   goiter, from our practice and from the available literature.

TI Sensitive and selective amplification of methylated DNA sequences using
   helper-dependent chain reaction in combination with a
   methylation-dependent restriction enzymes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB We have developed a novel technique for specific amplification of rare
   methylated DNA fragments in a high background of unmethylated sequences
   that avoids the need of bisulphite conversion. The methylation-dependent
   restriction enzyme GlaI is used to selectively cut methylated DNA. Then
   targeted fragments are tagged using specially designed 'helper'
   oligonucleotides that are also used to maintain selection in subsequent
   amplification cycles in a process called 'helper-dependent chain
   reaction'. The process uses disabled primers called 'drivers' that can
   only prime on each cycle if the helpers recognize specific sequences
   within the target amplicon. In this way, selection for the sequence of
   interest is maintained throughout the amplification, preventing
   amplification of unwanted sequences. Here we show how the method can be
   applied to methylated Septin 9, a promising biomarker for early
   diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The GlaI digestion and subsequent
   amplification can all be done in a single tube. A detection sensitivity
   of 0.1% methylated DNA in a background of unmethylated DNA was achieved,
   which was similar to the well-established Heavy Methyl method that
   requires bisulphite-treated DNA.

TI Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase accentuates endotoxin-induced
   sickness behavior in mice
SO PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR
AB Sickness behavior appears to be the expression of a central motivational
   state that reorganizes an organism's priorities to cope with infectious
   pathogens. To evaluate the possible participation of nitric oxide (NO)
   in lipopolysaccharide-induced sickness behaviors, mice were submitted to
   the forced swim test (FST), open field test and dark-light box test.
   Food intake and corticosterone plasma levels were evaluated.
   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 mu g/kg; i.p.) administration increased the
   time spent floating in the FST and decreased locomotor activity in the
   open field. Indeed, treatment with LPS decreased the total number of
   transitions between the dark and light compartments of the apparatus. In
   addition, LPS reduced food intake and increased corticosterone levels.
   Pretreatment with L-NAME (30 mg/kg; i.p.) or aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg;
   i.p.) accentuated the behavioral changes induced by LPS in the FST, open
   field and light-dark box tests as well as induced an increment in
   hypophagia and in corticosterone levels. These findings confirm previous
   observations that have reported LPS-induced sickness behaviors. In
   addition, they provide evidence that the synthesis of NO modulates
   changes in depressive-like and exploratory behaviors in mice, which is
   supported by the fact that NO synthase inhibitors also attenuate
   LPS-induced behavioral changes. In addition, the present study suggests
   that NO may have a protective role, acting in an inhibitory feedback
   manner to limit LPS-induced sickness behavior. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Midgut-enriched receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP52F is required
   for Drosophila development during larva-pupa transition
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB To date our understanding of Drosophila receptor protein tyrosine
   phosphatases (R-PTPs) in the regulation of signal transduction is
   limited. Of the seven R-PTPs identified in flies, six are involved in
   the axon guidance that occurs during embryogenesis. However, whether and
   how R-PTPs may control key steps of Drosophila development is not clear.
   In this study we investigated the potential role of Drosophila R-PTPs in
   developmental processes outside the neuronal system and beyond the
   embryogenesis stage. Through systematic data mining of available
   microarray databases, we found the mRNA level of PTP52F to be highly
   enriched in the midgut of flies at the larvapupa transition. This
   finding was confirmed by gut tissue staining with a specific antibody.
   The unique spatiotemporal expression of PTP52F suggests that it is
   possibly involved in regulating metamorphosis during the transformation
   from larva to pupa. To test this hypothesis, we employed RNA
   interference to examine the defects of transgenic flies. We found that
   ablation of endogenous PTP52F led to high lethality characterized by the
   pharate adult phenotype, occurring due to post pupal eclosion failure.
   These results show that PTP52F plays an indispensable role during the
   larvapupa transition. We also found that PTP52F could be reclassified as
   a member of the subtype R3 PTPs instead of as an unclassified R-PTP
   without a human ortholog, as suggested previously. Together, these
   findings suggest that Drosophila R-PTPs may control metamorphosis and
   other biological processes beyond our current knowledge.

TI Arrested spermatogenesis and evidence for DNA damage in PTIP mutant
   testes
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The differentiation of mature sperm from male germ cells requires both
   chromatin remodeling and compaction as well as DNA double stranded break
   repair of sister chromatids. We examined the function of PTIP, a protein
   implicated in both DNA repair and histone methylation, during
   spermatogenesis by using a conditional, inducible mutation in adult male
   mice. Loss of PTIP led to the developmental arrest of spermatocytes,
   testicular atrophy, and infertility. By immunostaining with specific
   markers for different stages of spermatogenesis and for proteins
   involved in DNA damage and repair mechanisms, we conclude that the lack
   of PTIP results in genomic instability and DNA damage resulting in the
   cessation of spermatogenesis in meiosis I. These data underscore the
   importance of PTIP in the DNA repair process associated with the
   development of mature spermatozoa. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Induced Pluripotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Clones Retain Donor-derived
   Differences in DNA Methylation Profiles
SO MOLECULAR THERAPY
AB Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced - pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs) is an epigenetic phenomenon. It has been suggested that iPSC
   retain some tissue-specific memory whereas little is known about
   interindividual epigenetic variation. We have reprogrammed mesenchymal
   stromal cells from human bone marrow (iP-MSC) and compared their DNA
   methylation profiles with initial MSC and embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
   using high-density DNA methylation arrays covering more than 450,000 CpG
   sites. Overall, DNA methylation patterns of iP-MSC and ESC were similar
   whereas some CpG sites revealed highly significant differences, which
   were not related to parental MSC. Furthermore, hypermethylation in
   iP-MSC versus ESC occurred preferentially outside of CpG islands and was
   enriched in genes involved in epidermal differentiation indicating that
   these differences are not due to random de novo methylation.
   Subsequently, we searched for CpG sites with donor-specific variation.
   These "epigenetic finger-prints" were highly enriched in non-promoter
   regions and outside of CpG islands-and they were maintained upon
   reprogramming. In conclusion, iP-MSC clones revealed relatively little
   intraindividual variation but they maintained donor-derived epigenetic
   differences. In the absence of isogenic controls, it would therefore be
   more appropriate to compare iPSC from different donors rather than a
   high number of different clones from the same patient. Received 30

TI Chromosome breakages associated with 45S ribosomal DNA sequences in
   spotted snakehead fish Channa punctatus
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB It is well known that transcriptionally inactive rRNA genes are
   correlated with DNA hyper-methylation and histone hypo-methylation and
   there is clear evidence in humans that DNA and histone modification
   which alter chromatin structure are related to chromosome fragility.
   Very little is known about the biological cause of 45S rDNA fragility.
   In this report we characterized the chromosome breakage or gap
   associated with 45S rDNA in a fish species Channa punctatus. The rDNA
   mapping in C. punctatus, showed many chromosome breakages or gap
   formations, and all occurred exclusively in the 45S rDNA sites in
   anterior kidney cells. We observed that the number of chromosomes plus
   chromosome fragments was often more than the expected 32 in most cells.
   Total 67 % metaphase spread showed the expected or normal 32
   chromosomes, while 33 % metaphase spread showed 33 and/or 34 chromosomes
   and/or chromosome fragments. The chromosome lesions observed in this
   study are very similar cytologically to that of fragile sites observed
   in human chromosomes. Possible causes for the spontaneous expression of
   fragile sites and their potential biological significance are also
   discussed in present report.

   take place in the context of chromatin. Modifications of either DNA or

TI The DNA demethylating agent decitabine activates the TRAIL pathway and
   induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB Although epigenetic drugs have been approved for use in selected
   malignancies, there is significant need for a better understanding of
   their mechanism of action. Here, we study the action of a clinically
   approved DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor - decitabine (DAC) - in acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. At low doses, DAC treatment induced
   apoptosis of NB4 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) cells, which was
   associated with the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
   Expression studies of the members of the Death Receptor family
   demonstrated that DAC induces the expression of TNF-related
   apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Upregulation of TRAIL, upon DAC
   treatment, was associated with specific epigenetic modifications induced
   by DAC in the proximity of the TRAIL promoter, as demonstrated by DNA
   demethylation, increased DNaseI sensitivity and histone acetylation of a
   non-CpG island, CpG-rich region located 2 kb upstream to the
   transcription start site. Luciferase assay experiments showed that this
   region behave as a DNA methylation sensitive transcriptional regulatory
   element. The CpG regulatory element was also found methylated in samples
   derived from APL patients. These findings have been confirmed in the
   non-APL, AML Kasumi cell line, suggesting that this regulatory mechanism
   may be extended to other AMLs. Our study suggests that DNA methylation
   is a regulatory mechanism relevant for silencing of the TRAIL apoptotic
   pathway in leukemic cells, and further elucidates the mechanism by which
   epigenetic drugs mediate their anti-leukemic effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Epigenetic silencing of PTPRR activates MAPK signaling, promotes
   metastasis and serves as a biomarker of invasive cervical cancer
SO ONCOGENE
AB Epigenetic modifications are a driving force in carcinogenesis. However,
   their role in cancer metastasis remains poorly understood. The present
   study investigated the role of DNA methylation in the cervical cancer
   metastasis. Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA
   methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the
   inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. Using methyl-DNA
   immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis, we found that the
   protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) was silenced
   through DNMT3B-mediated methylation in the cervical cancer. PTPRR
   inhibited p44/42 MAPK signaling, the expression of the transcription
   factor AP1, human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6/E7 and DNMTs. The
   methylation status of PTPRR increased in cervical scrapings (n = 358) in
   accordance with disease severity, especially in invasive cancer.
   Methylation of the PTPRR promoter has an important role in the
   metastasis and may be a biomarker of invasive cervical cancer. Oncogene

AB "Epigenetics" refers to a heritable change in transcriptional status
   without alteration in the primary nucleotide sequence. Epigenetics
   provides an extra layer of transcriptional control and plays a crucial
   role in normal development, as well as in pathological conditions. DNA
   methylation is one of the best known and well-studied epigenetic
   modifications. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling has become

TI Small noncoding differentially methylated copy-number variants,
   including lncRNA genes, cause a lethal lung developmental disorder
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB An unanticipated and tremendous amount of the noncoding sequence of the
   human genome is transcribed. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a
   significant fraction of non-protein-coding transcripts; however, their
   functions remain enigmatic. We demonstrate that deletions of a small
   noncoding differentially methylated region at 16q24.1, including lncRNA
   genes, cause a lethal lung developmental disorder, alveolar capillary
   dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV), with
   parent-of-origin effects. We identify overlapping deletions 250 kb
   upstream of FOXF1 in nine patients with ACD/MPV that arose de novo
   specifically on the maternally inherited chromosome and delete
   lung-specific lncRNA genes. These deletions define a distant
   cis-regulatory region that harbors, besides lncRNA genes, also a
   differentially methylated CpG island, binds GLI2 depending on the
   methylation status of this CpG island, and physically interacts with and
   up-regulates the FOXF1 promoter. We suggest that lung-transcribed
   16q24.1 lncRNAs may contribute to long-range regulation of FOXF1 by GLI2
   and other transcription factors. Perturbation of lncRNA-mediated
   chromatin interactions may, in general, be responsible for position
   effect phenomena and potentially cause many disorders of human
   development.

TI DNA Methylation: A Mechanism for Embedding Early Life Experiences in the
   Genome
SO CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AB Although epidemiological data provide evidence that early life
   experience plays a critical role in human development, the mechanism of
   how this works remains in question. Recent data from human and animal
   literature suggest that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are
   involved not only in cellular differentiation but also in the modulation
   of genome function in response to early life experience affecting gene
   function and the phenotype. Such modulations may serve as a mechanism
   for life-long genome adaptation. These changes seem to be widely
   distributed across the genome and to involve central and peripheral
   systems. Examining the environmental circumstances associated with the
   onset and reversal of DNA methylation will be critical for understanding
   risk and resiliency.

TI Biological clock dysfunction exacerbates contact hypersensitivity in
   mice
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB Background Immediate-type skin allergic reactions, such as passive
   cutaneous anaphylactic reaction, are associated with circadian rhythm,
   but the role of circadian mechanisms on delayed-type skin allergic
   reactions, such as contact hypersensitivity (CHS), remains uncertain. In
   mice, CHS, a T-cell-mediated immune response, is a classic model of
   human allergic contact dermatitis.
   Objectives We investigated whether biological clock dysfunction affects
   CHS pathogenesis in CLOCK mutant mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice.
   Methods Mice were treated with 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB) on
   the abdominal skin on day 0 (sensitization) and then treated with TNCB
   on the ears on day 5 (challenge).
   Results We found that biological clock dysfunction resulted in severe
   inflammation. Ear swelling, serum immunoglobulin E level and mast cell
   number were significantly increased in CLOCK mutant mice compared with
   WT mice. These results provide evidence that CLOCK mutation promotes the
   T-helper type 2 immune response and exacerbates CHS. Corticosterone has
   a protective effect on CHS. The serum corticosterone level lost
   rhythmicity and showed a decreased daily level in CLOCK mutant mice
   compared with WT mice, supporting the exacerbating effect of CLOCK
   mutation on CHS. Adrenalectomy markedly worsened TNCB-induced CHS in WT
   mice but not in CLOCK mutant mice. In addition, dramatic
   dexamethasone-induced protection of CHS was observed in CLOCK mutant
   mice compared with WT mice.
   Conclusions The present results suggest that circadian rhythm might be
   an important factor in the regulation of CHS via corticosterone
   rhythmicity and/or level.

TI Aberrant Epigenetic Gene Regulation in Lymphoid Malignancies
SO SEMINARS IN HEMATOLOGY
AB In lymphoid malignancies, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA
   methylation and histone modifications influence chromatin architecture
   and can result in altered gene expression. These alterations commonly
   affect genes that play important roles in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and
   DNA repair in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The ability to identify
   epigenetic modifications to these important genes has increased
   exponentially due to advances in technology. As a result, there are
   well-defined, gene-specific epigenetic aberrations associated with NHL
   comprising follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic
   lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
   The identification of these genes is important because they may be used
   as biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis and in developing improved
   treatment strategies. Also important, in the control of gene expression,
   is the packaging of DNA within the nucleus of a cell. This packaging can
   be distorted by epigenetic alterations and may alter the accessibility
   of certain regions of the genome in cancer cells. This review discusses
   the impact of known epigenetic aberration on the regulation of gene
   expression in NHL and provides insight into the spatial conformation of
   the genome (DNA packaging) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Semin

TI A pair of transposons coordinately suppresses gene expression,
   independent of pathways mediated by siRNA in Antirrhinum
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Our knowledge is limited regarding mechanisms by which transposable
   elements control host gene expression. Two Antirrhinum lines, HAM2 and
   HAM5, show different petal colors, pale-red and white, respectively,
   although these lines contain the same insertion of transposon Tam3 in
   the promoter region of the nivea (niv) locus encoding chalcone synthase.
   Among 1000 progeny from HAM5 grown under the preferred conditions for
   the Tam3 transposition, a few showed an intermediate petal color between
   HAM2 and HAM5. Transposon tagging using these progeny identified a
   causative insertion of Tam3 for the HAM5 type (white) petal color, which
   was found 1.6 kb downstream of the niv gene.
   Insertion of Tam3 at the position 1.6 kb downstream of niv alone showed
   nearly wildtype petal pigmentation, and the niv expression reduced by
   only 50%. Severe suppression of niv observed in HAM5 required
   interaction of two Tam3 copies on either side of the niv coding
   sequence. DNA methylation and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were not
   associated with the suppression of niv expression in HAM5.
   Insertion of a pair of transposons in close proximity can interfere with
   the expression of gene located between the two copies, and also provide
   evidence that this interference is not directly associated with pathways
   mediated by siRNAs.

TI Epigenetic expansion of VHL-HIF signal output drives multiorgan
   metastasis in renal cancer
SO NATURE MEDICINE
AB Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, VHL, is an
   archetypical tumor-initiating event in clear cell renal carcinoma
   (ccRCC) that leads to the activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription
   factors (HIFs). However, VHL mutation status in ccRCC is not correlated
   with clinical outcome. Here we show that during ccRCC progression,
   cancer cells exploit diverse epigenetic alterations to empower a branch
   of the VHL-HIF pathway for metastasis, and the strength of this
   activation is associated with poor clinical outcome. By analyzing
   metastatic subpopulations of VHL-deficient ccRCC cells, we discovered an
   epigenetically altered VHL-HIF response that is specific to metastatic
   ccRCC. Focusing on the two most prominent pro-metastatic VHL-HIF target
   genes, we show that loss of Polycomb repressive complex 2
   (PRC2)-dependent histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) activates H
   IF-driven chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in
   support of chemotactic cell invasion, whereas loss of DNA methylation
   enables HIF-driven cytohesin 1 interacting protein (CYTIP) expression to
   protect cancer cells from death cytokine signals. Thus, metastasis in
   ccRCC is based on an epigenetically expanded output of the
   tumor-initiating pathway.

TI Intestinal Master Transcription Factor CDX2 Controls Chromatin Access
   for Partner Transcription Factor Binding
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB Tissue-specific gene expression requires modulation of nucleosomes,
   allowing transcription factors to occupy cis elements that are
   accessible only in selected tissues. Master transcription factors
   control cell-specific genes and define cellular identities, but it is
   unclear if they possess special abilities to regulate cell-specific
   chromatin and if such abilities might underlie lineage determination and
   maintenance. One prevailing view is that several transcription factors
   enable chromatin access in combination. The homeodomain protein CDX2
   specifies the embryonic intestinal epithelium, through unknown
   mechanisms, and partners with transcription factors such as HNF4A in the
   adult intestine. We examined enhancer chromatin and gene expression
   following Cdx2 or Hnf4a excision in mouse intestines. HNF4A loss did not
   affect CDX2 binding or chromatin, whereas CDX2 depletion modified
   chromatin significantly at CDX2-bound enhancers, disrupted HNF4A
   occupancy, and abrogated expression of neighboring genes. Thus, CDX2
   maintains transcription-permissive chromatin, illustrating a powerful
   and dominant effect on enhancer configuration in an adult tissue.
   Similar, hierarchical control of cell-specific chromatin states is
   probably a general property of master transcription factors.

TI Genetic and epigenetic factors in regulation of microRNA in colorectal
   cancers
SO METHODS
AB Studies on miRNA profiling revealed that a large number of them are
   significantly deregulated in human cancers. The molecular mechanisms of
   this deregulation are not totally clarified, even if genetics and
   epigenetics are frequently involved.
   Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of
   genetic variation in the human genome. A SNP into miRNA gene might
   affect the transcription of primary miRNA, its processing and miRNA-mRNA
   interaction. We investigated the distribution of sequence variants of
   miR-146a, miR-196a2, miR-499 and miR-149 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and
   their effect on miRNA expression. Each variant was identified with HRM.
   For miR-499 we demonstrated a significant reduction of its expression in
   CRC connected to a specific genotype.
   To evaluate the epigenetic effects on miRNA genes in CRC, we
   investigated the influence of DNA methylation on miR-34b, miR-34c and
   miR-9-1 expression. We aimed to verify the relationship between the
   methylation status of these miRNA genes and their relative expression in
   tumor samples. For the quantification of DNA methylation we adopted a
   method based on Differential High Resolution Melting (D-HRM). (C) 2012

TI The Essential Role of Anti-Thyroid Antibodies in Chronic Idiopathic
   Urticaria
SO ENDOCRINE RESEARCH
AB Background. An autoimmune etiology has been suggested in up to one-third
   of cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), in which it has been
   proposed that a subset of cases are associated with thyroid
   autoimmunity. The objective of our present study was to verify the
   prevalence of thyroid antibodies in the patients with CIU. Methods.
   Sixty patients aged 12-51 years, who met criteria for CIU, and 40
   aged-matched healthy controls (18 males and 22 females) were
   participated in this study. Serum anti-thyroid antibodies (ATAs),
   thyroid hormones, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), and food
   allergen-specific IgE antibodies were measured. The CIU group was
   treated with anti-H1 and anti-H2 histamines for 3 weeks. Results. The
   total ATA positive rate was 27.3% (33% males and 25% females) in the CIU
   group. The prevalence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies,
   anti-TSH-receptor antibodies, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies
   were 16.6%, 83.3%, and 8.3%, respectively. The thyroid hormones, T3, and
   T4, and the TSH were within the normal limits. The radioallergosorbent
   test was negative for food allergens, and only 18% of the patients had a
   total IgE concentration >200 IU/mL. Conclusion. ATAs were found in 27%
   of the patients with CIU, but these antibodies did not dysregulate
   thyroid hormone secretion nor did they mediate any clinical
   manifestations.

TI Arabidopsis Paired Amphipathic Helix Proteins SNL1 and SNL2 Redundantly
   Regulate Primary Seed Dormancy via Abscisic Acid-Ethylene Antagonism
   Mediated by Histone Deacetylation
SO PLANT CELL
AB Histone (de)acetylation is a highly conserved chromatin modification
   that is vital for development and growth. In this study, we identified a
   role in seed dormancy for two members of the histone deacetylation
   complex in Arabidopsis thaliana, SIN3-LIKE1 (SNL1) and SNL2. The double
   mutant snl1 snl2 shows reduced dormancy and hypersensitivity to the
   histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and diallyl disulfide
   compared with the wild type. SNL1 interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE19
   in vitro and in planta, and loss-of-function mutants of SNL1 and SNL2
   show increased acetylation levels of histone 3 lysine 9/18 (H3K9/18) and
   H3K14. Moreover, SNL1 and SNL2 regulate key genes involved in the
   ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) pathways by decreasing their histone
   acetylation levels. Taken together, we showed that SNL1 and SNL2
   regulate seed dormancy by mediating the ABA-ethylene antagonism in
   Arabidopsis. SNL1 and SNL2 could represent a cross-link point of the ABA
   and ethylene pathways in the regulation of seed dormancy.

TI Ocean acidification reduces induction of coral settlement by crustose
   coralline algae
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are a critical component of coral reefs
   as they accrete carbonate for reef structure and act as settlement
   substrata for many invertebrates including corals. CCA host a diversity
   of microorganisms that can also play a role in coral settlement and
   metamorphosis processes. Although the sensitivity of CCA to ocean
   acidification (OA) is well established, the response of their associated
   microbial communities to reduced pH and increased CO2 was previously not
   known. Here we investigate the sensitivity of CCA-associated microbial
   biofilms to OA and determine whether or not OA adversely affects the
   ability of CCA to induce coral larval metamorphosis. We experimentally
   exposed the CCA Hydrolithon onkodes to four pH/pCO2 conditions
   consistent with current IPCC predictions for the next few centuries (pH:
   8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5, pCO2: 464, 822, 1187, 1638 mu atm). Settlement and
   metamorphosis of coral larvae was reduced on CCA pre-exposed to pH 7.7
   (pCO2 = 1187 mu atm) and below over a 6-week period. Additional
   experiments demonstrated that low pH treatments did not directly affect
   the ability of larvae to settle, but instead most likely altered the
   biochemistry of the CCA or its microbial associates. Detailed microbial
   community analysis of the CCA revealed diverse bacterial assemblages
   that altered significantly between pH 8.1 (pCO2 = 464 mu atm) and pH 7.9
   (pCO2 = 822 mu atm) with this trend continuing at lower pH/higher pCO2
   treatments. The shift in microbial community composition primarily
   comprised changes in the abundance of the dominant microbes between the
   different pH treatments and the appearance of new (but rare) microbes at
   pH 7.5. Microbial shifts and the concomitant reduced ability of CCA to
   induce coral settlement under OA conditions projected to occur by 2100
   is a significant concern for the development, maintenance and recovery
   of reefs globally.

TI Early progress in epigenetic regulation of endothelin pathway genes
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Control of gene transcription is a major regulatory determinant for
   function of the endothelin pathway. Epigenetic mechanisms act on
   tissue-specific gene expression during development and in response to
   physiological stimuli. Most of the limited evidence available on
   epigenetic regulation of the endothelin pathway focuses on the EDN1 and
   EDNRB genes. Examination of whole genome databases suggests that both
   genes are influenced by histone modifications and DNA methylation. This
   interpretation is supported by studies directed at detecting epigenetic
   action on the two genes. The clearest illustration of epigenetic factors
   altering endothelin signalling is DNA methylation-associated EDNRB
   silencing during tumourigenesis. This review summarizes our current
   understanding of epigenetic regulation of the endothelin pathway genes.

TI Zinc deficiency induces production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1
   beta and TNF alpha in promyeloid cells via epigenetic and
   redox-dependent mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The deprivation of zinc, caused by malnutrition or as a consequence of
   aging or disease, strongly affects immune cell functions, causing higher
   frequency of infections. Among other effects, an increased production of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines has been
   observed in zinc-deficient patients, but the underlying mechanisms were
   unknown. The aim of the current study was to define mechanisms
   explaining the increase in proinflammatory cytokine production during
   zinc deficiency, focusing on the role of epigenetic and redox-mediated
   mechanisms.
   Interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha production
   was increased in HL-60 cells under zinc deficiency. Analyses of the
   chromatin structure demonstrated that the elevated cytokine production
   was due to increased accessibilities of IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha
   promoters in zinc-deficient cells. Moreover, the level of nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH) oxidase-produced ROS was
   elevated under zinc deficiency, subsequently leading to p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. The increased
   activation of p38 MAPK appeared to be necessary for posttranscriptional
   processes in IL-1 beta and INF alpha synthesis.
   These data demonstrate that IL-1 beta and TNF alpha expression under
   zinc deficiency is regulated via epigenetic and redox-mediated
   mechanisms. Assuming an important role of zinc in proinflammatory
   cytokine regulation, this should encourage research in the use of zinc
   supplementation for treatment of inflammatory diseases. (c) 2013

TI Epigenetics makes its mark on women-specific cancers-an opportunity to
   redefine oncological approaches?
SO GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
AB Over the past decade it has become clear that cancer is an epigenetic
   and a genetic disease. While we have begun to understand the impact of
   variations in the DNA sequence on cancer development, it is only more
   recently that we have appreciated the significant contribution of the
   epigenome to carcinogenesis and cancer biology. Twin studies demonstrate
   that genetics makes little contribution to the development of
   women-specific cancers and that the 'epigenome,' the interphase between
   genome and environment, is likely to confer the largest component of
   risk. Epigenetic factors can therefore act as surrogate markers of
   disease risk that could potentially facilitate tailored treatment and
   refine preventive measures. This review focuses attention on DNA
   methylation a core epigenetic mechanism that can be readily detected in
   body fluids and has the potential to substantially reform cancer
   screening and treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Mouse oocyte meiosis is disturbed by knockdown of Suv4-20h
SO REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Suv4-20h was initially characterised as a histone methyltransferase
   (HMTase) that catalyses lysine 20 of histone H4 dimethylation (H4K20me2)
   and trimethylation (H4K20me3). In the present study, using RNA
   interference (RNAi), we found that Suv4-20h activity is required for the
   fidelity of chromosome distribution during meiosis in the mammalian
   oocyte. Knockdown of Suv4-20h resulted in attenuation of H4K20me3 and
   the accumulation of H4K20me1. After Suv4-20h knockdown, oocytes
   exhibited an increasing percentage of aberrant chromosome alignment in
   MI, together with a decreasing percentage of polar body I extrusion. We
   conclude that Suv4-20h may be required for normal chromosome behaviour
   and that it is crucial for proper meiotic progression in mammalian
   oocytes.

TI Stress-mediated p38 activation promotes somatic cell reprogramming
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB Environmental stress-mediated adaptation plays essential roles in the
   evolution of life. Cellular adaptation mechanisms usually involve the
   regulation of chromatin structure, transcription, mRNA stability and
   translation, which eventually lead to efficient changes in gene
   expression. Global epigenetic change is also involved in the
   reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
   by defined factors. Here we report that environmental stress such as
   hyperosmosis not only facilitates four factor-mediated reprogramming,
   but also enhances two or one factor-induced iPS cell generation.
   Hyperosmosis-induced p38 activation plays a critical role in this
   process. Constitutive active p38 mimics the positive effect of
   hyperosmosis, while dominant negative p38 and p38 inhibitor block the
   effect of hyperosmosis. Further study indicates stress-mediated p38
   activation may promote reprogramming by reducing the global DNA
   methylation level and enhancing the expression of pluripotency genes.
   Our results demonstrate how simple environmental stress like
   hyperosmosis helps to alter the fate of cells via intracellular
   signaling and epigenetic modulation.

TI MeDIP coupled with a promoter tiling array as a platform to investigate
   global DNA methylation patterns in AML cells
SO LEUKEMIA RESEARCH
AB Hypermethylation of CpGs in promoter regions and subsequent changes in
   gene expression are common features in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
   Genome-wide studies of the methylome are not only useful to understand
   changes in DNA methylation and gene regulation but also to identify
   potential targets for antileukemic treatment. Here we performed
   methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) in the AML cell line HL-60
   and donor-derived CD34+ cells, followed by hybridization on a human
   promoter tiling array. The comparative analysis of HL-60 versus CD34+
   cells revealed differentially methylated promoter regions including
   genes that are frequently methylated in AML, such as p15/INK4B, OLIG2,
   RAR beta 2 and estrogen receptor. Microarray data was validated by
   quantitative pyrosequencing. We corroborate previous reports that MeDIP,
   in our study combined with a promoter tiling array (MeDIP-Chip), is a
   robust method to identify genes that are differentially methylated in
   AML cells in a genome-wide manner, and is thus useful to identify new
   epigenetic targets for therapeutic or prognostic research. (C) 2012

   Methylation
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY
AB We describe a case of a 5-year-old girl with central nervous system
   relapse of neuroblastoma after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous
   stem cell transplantation. Although the brain metastasis was surgically
   removed, she had a second relapse in the same region with leptomeningeal
   dissemination despite receiving irinotecan. Administration of
   temozolomide in addition to irinotecan led to her third complete
   response and the patient has been in complete response for > 24 months.
   The tumor had no expression of the O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase

TI Validation of a Fecal Glucocorticoid Metabolite Assay to Assess Stress
   in the Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus)
SO ZOO BIOLOGY
AB The budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) is a small parrot native to
   Australia that is commonly held in zoos, laboratories, and private
   homes. Assessment of budgerigar stress levels would aid welfare
   monitoring and improve our understanding of their biology. Analyzing
   fecal glucocorticoid metabolites provides a noninvasive method to
   measure stress levels in birds. For this method to be reliable, the
   antibody to be used in an immunoassay must be carefully selected for
   each species, and validation must be performed. A common limitation in
   many existing assays is the inability to accurately detect variable
   fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in minute quantities of feces,
   requiring small samples to be combined. We have developed a double
   antibody radioimmunoassay protocol based on a commercially available
   125I-corticosterone radioimmunoassay kit for use in detecting fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites in small quantities (<20 mg) of budgerigar
   droppings. The assay was validated pharmacologically with an
   adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge and with oral administration of
   corticosterone. Our validation has demonstrated our assay is both
   sensitive and a reliable approach to noninvasive monitoring of stress in
   budgerigars. Zoo Biol. 32:112-116, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

TI FOXO1 Controls Thyroid Cell Proliferation in Response to TSH and IGF-I
   and Is Involved in Thyroid Tumorigenesis
SO MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB TSH and insulin/IGF-I synergistically induce the proliferation of
   thyroid cells mainly through the cAMP and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   (PI3K) pathways. However, the events involved in this cooperative
   induction remain unknown, and molecules that are potentially controlled
   by both TSH and IGF-I are interesting candidates as integrators of both
   stimuli. The finding that the PI3K pathway is frequently activated in
   thyroid malignancies has attracted attention to this pathway in the
   thyroid field. One of the targets of PI3K is Forkhead box O (FoxO)-1, a
   widely expressed transcription factor involved in a variety of cellular
   processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here we
   show that FoxO1 is highly expressed in differentiated rat thyroid cells
   and human thyroid tissue compared with human thyroid tumor-derived cells
   and surgically removed thyroid tumors, in which its expression is
   reduced. In differentiated cells, TSH/cAMP treatment decreases FoxO1
   mRNA and protein levels through proteasome activation, whereas both TSH
   and IGF-I control FoxO1 localization by promoting a rapid exclusion from
   the nucleus in an Akt-dependent manner. FoxO1 can control p27(KIP1)
   expression in differentiated and tumor cells of the thyroid.
   Furthermore, FoxO1 reexpression in tumor cells promotes a decrease in
   their proliferation rate, whereas FoxO1 interference in differentiated
   cells increases their proliferation. These data point to an important
   role of FoxO1 in mediating the effects of TSH and IGF-I on thyroid cell
   proliferation and provide a link between loss of FoxO1 expression and
   the uncontrolled proliferation of thyroid tumor cells. (Molecular

SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The mechanisms by which histones are disassembled and reassembled into

   transcription are poorly understood. A better understanding of the
   processes involved is, however, crucial if we are to understand whether
   and how histone variants and post-translationally modified histones are

   interaction of the histone H3-H4 complex with the human
   retinoblastoma-associated protein RbAp48 and their exchange with a
   second histone chaperone, anti-silencing function protein 1 (ASF1).
   Exchange of histones H3-H4 between these two histone chaperones has a
   central role in the assembly of new nucleosomes, and we show here that
   the H3-H4 complex has an unexpected structural plasticity, which is
   important for this exchange.

TI Epigenetic Mechanisms for the Early Environmental Regulation of
   Hippocampal Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene Expression in Rodents and
   Humans
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Parental care influences development across mammals. In humans such
   influences include effects on phenotypes, such as stress reactivity,
   which determine individual differences in the vulnerability for
   affective disorders. Thus, the adult offspring of rat mothers that show
   an increased frequency of pup licking/grooming (ie, high LG mothers)
   show increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and
   more modest hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress compared
   with the offspring of low LG mothers. In humans, childhood maltreatment
   associates decreased hippocampal GR expression and increased stress
   responses in adulthood. We review the evidence suggesting that such
   effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation
   and hydroxymethylation across GR promoter regions. We also present new
   findings revealing associated histone post-translational modifications
   of a critical GR promoter in rat hippocampus. Taken together these
   existing evidences are consistent with the idea that parental influences
   establish stable phenotypic variation in the offspring through effects
   on intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the epigenetic state
   and function of specific regions of the genome. Neuropsychopharmacology

TI Effects of group stability on aggression, stress and injuries in
   breeding rabbits
SO APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE
AB On Swiss rabbit breeding farms, group-housed does are usually kept
   singly for 12 days around parturition to avoid pseudograviclity, double
   litters and deleterious fighting for nests. After this isolation phase
   there is usually an integration of new group members. Here we studied
   whether keeping the group composition stable would reduce agonistic
   interactions, stress levels and injuries when regrouping after the
   isolation phase.
   Does were kept in 12 pens containing 8 rabbits each. In two trials, with
   a total of 24 groups, the group composition before and after the 12 days
   isolation period remained the same (treatment: stable, S) in 12 groups.
   In the other 12 groups two or three does were replaced after the
   isolation phase by unfamiliar does (treatment: mixed, M). Does of
   S-groups had been housed together for one reproduction cycle. One day
   before and on days 2, 4 and 6 after regrouping, data on lesions, stress
   levels (faecal corticosterone metabolites, FCM) and agonistic
   interactions were collected and statistically analysed using mixed
   effects models.
   Lesion scores and the frequency of agonistic interactions were highest
   on day 2 after regrouping and thereafter decrease in both groups. There
   was a trend towards more lesions in M-groups compared to S-groups. After
   regrouping FCM levels were increased in M-groups, but not in S-groups.
   Furthermore, there was a significant interaction of treatment and
   experimental day on agonistic interactions. Thus, the frequency of
   biting and boxing increased more in M-groups than in S-groups. These
   findings indicate that group stability had an effect on agonistic
   interactions, stress and lesions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI The Specificity Protein Factor Sp1 Mediates Transcriptional Regulation
   of P2X7 Receptors in the Nervous System
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB P2X7 receptors are involved not only in physiological functions but also
   in pathological brain processes. Although an increasing number of
   findings indicate that altered receptor expression has a causative role
   in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, little is known about how
   expression of P2rx7 gene is controlled. Here we reported the first
   molecular and functional evidence that Specificity protein 1 (Sp1)
   transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional
   regulation of P2X7 receptor. We delimited a minimal region in the murine
   P2rx7 promoter containing four SP1 sites, two of them being highly
   conserved in mammals. The functionality of these SP1 sites was confirmed
   by site-directed mutagenesis and Sp1 overexpression/down-regulation in
   neuroblastoma cells. Inhibition of Sp1-mediated transcriptional
   activation by mithramycin A reduced endogenous P2X7 receptor levels in
   primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes. Using P2rx7-EGFP
   transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein under
   the control of P2rx7 promoter, we found a high correlation between
   reporter expression and Sp1 levels in the brain, demonstrating that Sp1
   is a key element in the transcriptional regulation of P2X7 receptor in
   the nervous system. Finally, we found that Sp1 mediates P2X7 receptor
   up-regulation in neuroblastoma cells cultured in the absence of serum, a
   condition that enhances chromatin accessibility and facilitates the
   exposure of SP1 binding sites.

SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB This work offers a comprehensive understanding of the conditions
   required for the selective masking of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in
   technical kraft lignins, which is pivotal in determining their
   subsequent chemical and thermal reactivity. To this effect, we have
   examined the chemistry and developed the conditions for the facile,
   mild, and selective masking of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in softwood
   and hardwood haft lignins. We have compared two series of methylated
   softwood kraft lignins synthesized using different methylation
   chemistries. Our data show that (when used as specified) dimethyl
   sulfate in aqueous NaOH selectively converts the phenolic hydroxyl
   groups of kraft lignin to its methylated derivatives without apparent
   side reactions. In contrast, methyl iodide (in the presence of excess
   K(2)CO(3) in N,N-dimethylformamide) was found to be rather ineffective
   and unselective. Various milder methylation conditions were also
   examined for both softwood and hardwood haft lignins using dimethyl
   sulfate, and the details of this work are documented. In addition, a
   series of oxypropylation reactions were also carried out using propylene
   oxide in aqueous NaOH. Propylene oxide was shown to selectively add (at
   room temperature, 0.5 M NaOH, 18 h) less than two units on average per
   phenolic hydroxyl group without significant additional polymerization or

TI The chromatin remodeler p400 ATPase facilitates Rad51-mediated repair of
   DNA double-strand breaks
SO JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB DNA damage signaling and repair take place in a chromatin context.
   Consequently, chromatin-modifying enzymes, including adenosine
   triphosphate dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, play an important
   role in the management of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we show
   that the p400 ATPase is required for DNA repair by homologous
   recombination (HR). Indeed, although p400 is not required for DNA damage
   signaling, DNA DSB repair is defective in the absence of p400. We
   demonstrate that p400 is important for HR-dependent processes, such as
   recruitment of Rad51 to DSB (a key component of HR), homology-directed
   repair, and survival after DNA damage. Strikingly, p400 and Rad51 are
   present in the same complex and both favor chromatin remodeling around
   DSBs. Altogether, our data provide a direct molecular link between Rad51
   and a chromatin remodeling enzyme involved in chromatin decompaction
   around DNA DSBs.

AB ICP0, a key herpes simplex virus regulatory protein, functions first in
   the nucleus and then in the cytoplasm. The duration of its nuclear
   sojourn in cells transfected with DNA and then infected is related to
   the quantity of transfected DNA. Furthermore, ICP0 transactivates both
   viral genes and genes encoded by the transfected DNA. The data support
   the hypothesis that ICP0 is retained in the nucleus until it completes
   the replacement of repressive chromatin with effector proteins that
   enable transcription of both DNA templates. To identify the effector
   proteins, we transfected cells with biotinylated DNA encoding a nonviral
   gene and then infected the cells with wild-type virus. Proteins bound to
   transfected biotinylated plasmid recovered from mock-treated and
   infected cells were identified using mass spectrometry followed by
   appropriate database search. The transfected DNA from mock-infected
   cells yielded proteins associated with repression, whereas DNA recovered
   from infected cells included proteins known to enable transcription and
   proteins that have not been previously associated with that role. To
   test the hypothesis that the proteins hitherto not known to associate
   with viral gene expression are nevertheless essential, we tested the
   role of the DEAD-box helicase Ddx17. We report that Ddx17 plays a
   critical role in the expression of early and late viral genes. Thus,
   biotinylated DNA recovered from transfected infected cells can function
   as a surrogate for viral DNA and is a rich source of proteins that play
   a role in viral gene expression but which have not been previously
   identified in that role.

TI Seasonal Variation of Corticosterone Levels in Graptemys flavimaculata,
   an Imperiled Freshwater Turtle
SO COPEIA
AB Currently, little is known about the seasonal variation of
   corticosterone (CORT) levels, either baseline or stress response, within
   freshwater turtles. We conducted a seasonal CORT study with a species of
   freshwater turtle, Graptemys flavimaculata (Yellow-blotched Sawback;
   family Emydidae), that is endemic to the Pascagoula River system of
   southeastern Mississippi. Graptemys flavimaculata is commonly observed
   while basking on deadwood snags, with us using basking traps and dip
   nets as active capture methods. We caught both male (n = 60) and female
   (n = 49) turtles during the months of April-October during 2007 and
   2008. Immediately after capture, we collected an initial blood sample,
   confined the turtle for 35 minutes, and then took a second blood sample.
   Competitive binding radioimmunoassays were done to determine CORT
   levels. Time zero CORT levels for both sexes were generally lower than
   previously reported levels for other turtle species, likely due to the
   trapping methods used. By time 35 min, CORT levels were significantly
   elevated relative to initial levels. We did not detect seasonal
   differences in time zero CORT levels for males or females. However,
   seasonal differences in time 35 CORT levels for males were detected,
   with higher levels observed during summer months (July, August) relative
   to spring (April) and fall (October) months. Seasonal differences were
   also detected in time 35 CORT levels of females, with lower levels
   observed during July (nesting season) relative to September. This study
   provides novel information and insight into the differences in seasonal
   physiological demands for this species, and aquatic turtle species in
   general, while also providing probable connections of physiology to
   seasonal life history events.

TI Transcriptional regulation of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) by the tumor
   suppressor protein p53
SO CELL CYCLE
AB Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) belongs to the superfamily of uracil DNA
   glycosylases (UDG) and is the first enzyme in the base-excision repair
   pathway (BER) that removes thymine from G: T mismatches at CpG sites.
   This glycosylase activity has also been found to be critical for active
   demethylation of genes involved in embryonic development. Here we show
   that wild-type p53 transcriptionally regulates TDG expression. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assays indicate that wild-type
   p53 binds to a domain of TDG promoter containing two p53 consensus
   response elements (p53RE) and activates its transcription. Next, we have
   used a panel of cell lines with different p53 status to demonstrate that
   TDG mRNA and protein expression levels are induced in a p53-dependent
   manner under different conditions. This panel includes isogenic breast
   and colorectal cancer cell lines with wild-type or inactive p53,
   esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines lacking p53 or expressing
   a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant and normal human bronchial epithelial
   cells. Induction of TDG mRNA expression is accompanied by accumulation
   of TDG protein in both nucleus and cytoplasm, with nuclear
   re-localization occurring upon DNA damage in p53-competent, but not
   -incompetent, cells. These observations suggest a role for p53 activity
   in TDG nuclear translocation. Overall, our results show that TDG
   expression is directly regulated by p53, suggesting that loss of p53
   function may affect processes mediated by TDG, thus negatively impacting
   on genetic and epigenetic stability.

TI Cadmium as an endocrine disruptor: Correlation with anterior pituitary
   redox and circadian clock mechanisms and prevention by melatonin
SO FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB To examine the effect of a low dose of cadmium (Cd) as an endocrine
   disruptor, male Wistar rats received CdCl(2) (5 ppm Cd) in drinking
   water or drinking water alone. After 1 month, the rats were euthanized
   at one of six time intervals around the clock and the 24-h pattern of
   adenohypophysial prolactin (PRL) synthesis and release, lipid
   peroxidation, and redox enzyme and metallothionein (MT) gene expression
   was examined. Cd suppressed 24-h rhythmicity in expression of the PRL
   gene and in circulating PRL by increasing them at early photophase only,
   in correlation with an augmented pituitary lipid peroxidation and redox
   enzyme expression. CdCl(2) treatment effectively disrupted the 24-h
   variation in expression of every pituitary parameter tested except for
   MT-3. In a second experiment the effect of melatonin (3 mu g/ml in
   drinking water) was assessed at early photophase, the time of maximal
   endocrine-disrupting effect of Cd. Melatonin treatment blunted the
   effect of Cd on PRL synthesis and release, decreased Cd-induced lipid
   peroxidation, and counteracted the effect of Cd on expression of most
   redox enzymes. A third experiment was performed to examine whether
   melatonin could counteract Cd-induced changes in the 24-h pattern of
   pituitary circadian clock gene expression and plasma PRL, luteinizing
   hormone (LH), thyrotropin (TSH). and corticosterone levels. Rats
   receiving CdCl(2) exhibited a suppressed daily rhythm of Clock
   expression and a significant disruption in daily rhythms of pituitary
   Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The coadministration of melatonin
   restored rhythmicity in Clock and Bmal1 expression but shifted the
   maxima in pituitary Per1, Cry1, and Cry2 expression to the scotophase.
   Melatonin also counteracted the effect of Cd on 24-h rhythmicity of
   circulating PRL, LH, TSH, and corticosterone. The results highlight the
   occurrence of a significant endocrine disruptor effect of a low dose of
   Cd. Generally melatonin counteracted the effects of Cd and ameliorated
   partially the circadian disruption caused by the pollutant. (C) 2012

TI 5-aza-CdR induces the demethylation of Syk promoter in nasopharyngeal
   carcinoma cell
SO GENE
AB The present study employed 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) to treat
   nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-1, CNE-2 and non-cancerous human
   nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP-69 to understand the effects on
   spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) gene promoter methylation. The results
   showed that the methylation level of Syk gene is negatively associated
   with the differentiation level of the cell lines, and the 5-aza-CdR
   treatment decreased the methylation level in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
   cell lines. Additionally, the drug sensitivity of low-differentiated
   cell line was significantly higher than the high-differentiated cell
   line. In conclusion, the Syk gene promoter methylation reflects the cell
   differentiation status, and 5-aza-CdR treatment could induce the
   demethylation of Syk gene promoter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Combined 3D-QSAR, molecular docking and molecular dynamics study on
   thyroid hormone activity of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers
   to thyroid receptors beta
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Several recent reports suggested that hydroxylated polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (HO-PBDEs) may disturb thyroid hormone homeostasis. To
   illuminate the structural features for thyroid hormone activity of
   HO-PBDEs and the binding mode between HO-PBDEs and thyroid hormone
   receptor (TR), the hormone activity of a series of HO-PBDEs to thyroid
   receptors 13 was studied based on the combination of 3D-QSAR, molecular
   docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) methods. The ligand- and
   receptor-based 3D-QSAR models were obtained using Comparative Molecular
   Similarity Index Analysis (CoMSIA) method. The optimum CoMSIA model with
   region focusing yielded satisfactory statistical results: leave-one-out
   cross-validation correlation coefficient (q(2)) was 0.571 and
   non-cross-validation correlation coefficient (r(2)) was 0.951.
   Furthermore, the results of internal validation such as bootstrapping,
   leave-many-out cross-validation, and progressive scrambling as well as
   external validation indicated the rationality and good predictive
   ability of the best model. In addition, molecular docking elucidated the
   conformations of compounds and key amino acid residues at the docking
   pocket, MD simulation further determined the binding process and
   validated the rationality of docking results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI The effects of clobazam treatment in rats on the expression of genes and
   proteins encoding glucronosyltransferase 1A/2B (UGT1A/2B) and multidrug
   resistance-associated protein-2 (MRP2), and development of thyroid
   follicular cell hypertrophy
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Clobazam (CLB) is known to increase hepatobiliary thyroxine (T4)
   clearance in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, which results in hypothyroidism
   followed by thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy. However, the mechanism
   of the acceleration of T4-clearance has not been fully investigated.
   In the present study, we tried to clarify the roles of hepatic
   UDP-glucronosyltransferase (UGT) isoenzymes (UGT1A and UGT2B) and efflux
   transporter (multidrug resistance-associated protein-2; MRP2) in the
   CLB-induced acceleration of T4-clearance using two mutant rat strains,
   UGT1A-deficient mutant (Gunn) and MRP2-deficient mutant (EHBR) rats,
   especially focusing on thyroid morphology, levels of circulating
   hormones (T4 and triiodothyronine (T3)) and thyroid-stimulating hormone
   (TSH), and mRNA or protein expressions of UGTs (Ugt1a1, Ugt1a6, and
   Ugt2b1/2) and MRP2 (Mrp).
   CLB induced thyroid morphological changes with increases in TSH in SD
   and Gunn rats, but not in EHBR rats. T4 was slightly decreased in SD and
   Gunn rats, and 13 was decreased in Gunn rats, whereas these hormones
   were maintained in EHBR rats. Hepatic Ugt1a1, Ugt1a6, Ugt2b1/2, and Mrp2
   mRNAs were upregulated in SD rats. In Gunn rats, UGT1A mRNAs (Ugt1a1/6)
   and protein levels were quite low, but UGT2B mRNAs (Ugt2b1/2) and
   protein were prominently upregulated. In SD and Gunn rats, MRP2 mRNA and
   protein were upregulated to the same degree. These results suggest that
   MRP2 is an important contributor in development of the thyroid cellular
   hypertrophy in CLI3-treated rats, and that UGT1A and UGT2B work in
   concert with MRP2 in the presence of MRP2 function to enable the
   effective elimination of thyroid hormones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Histone variant macroH2A marks embryonic differentiation in vivo and
   acts as an epigenetic barrier to induced pluripotency
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB How cell fate becomes restricted during somatic cell differentiation is
   a long-lasting question in biology. Epigenetic mechanisms not present in
   pluripotent cells and acquired during embryonic development are expected
   to stabilize the differentiated state of somatic cells and thereby
   restrict their ability to convert to another fate. The histone variant
   macroH2A acts as a component of an epigenetic multilayer that heritably
   maintains the silent X chromosome and has been shown to restrict tumor
   development. Here we show that macroH2A marks the differentiated cell
   state during mouse embryogenesis. MacroH2A.1 was found to be present at
   low levels upon the establishment of pluripotency in the inner cell mass
   and epiblast, but it was highly enriched in the trophectoderm and
   differentiated somatic cells later in mouse development. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation revealed that macroH2A.1 is incorporated in the
   chromatin of regulatory regions of pluripotency genes in somatic cells
   such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult neural stem cells, but not
   in embryonic stem cells. Removal of macroH2A.1, macroH2A.2 or both
   increased the efficiency of induced pluripotency up to 25-fold. The
   obtained induced pluripotent stem cells reactivated pluripotency genes,
   silenced retroviral transgenes and contributed to chimeras. In addition,
   overexpression of macroH2A isoforms prevented efficient reprogramming of
   epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency. In summary, our study
   identifies for the first time a link between an epigenetic mark and cell
   fate restriction during somatic cell differentiation, which helps to
   maintain cell identity and antagonizes induction of a pluripotent stem
   cell state.

TI Hypoxia induces downregulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase beta(1) by
   miR-34c-5p
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the principal receptor for nitric
   oxide (NO) and crucial for the control of various physiological
   functions. The beta(1) subunit of sGC is obligatory for the biological
   stability and activity of the sGC heterodimer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
   important regulators of gene expression and exert great influences on
   diverse biological activities. The aim of the present study was to
   determine whether or not the expression of sGC beta(1) is specifically
   regulated by miRNAs. We report that miR-34c-5p directly targets sGC
   beta(1) under hypoxia. Bioinformatics analysis of the sGC beta(1)
   3'-untranslated region (39-UTR) revealed a putative binding site for
   miR-34b- 5p and miR-34c-5p, but only miR-34c-5p inhibited luciferase
   activity through interaction with sGC beta(1) 3'-UTR in HEK293T cells.
   Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative miR-34c-5p binding site
   abolished the negative regulation of luciferase expression.
   Overexpression of miR-34c-5p repressed the expression of sGC beta(1) in
   stable cell lines, which was reversed by miR-34c-5p-specific sponge.
   Inoculation of mouse lung tissues in vitro with lentivirus bearing
   miR-34c-5p significantly decreased both the expression of sGCb1 and
   NO-stimulated sGC activity, which was also rescued by
   miR-34c-5p-specific sponge. Furthermore, we identified the putative
   Sp1-binding site in the promoter region of miR-34c-5p. Luciferase
   reporter constructs revealed that Sp1 directly binds to the wild-type
   promoter of miR-34c-5p, which was confirmed by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation. In summary, these findings reveal that miR-34c-5p
   directly regulates sGC beta(1) expression, and they identify the key
   transcription factor Sp1 that governs miR-34c-5p expression during
   hypoxia.

TI Daytime restricted feeding modifies 24 h rhythmicity and subcellular
   distribution of liver glucocorticoid receptor and the urea cycle in rat
   liver
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB The timing system in mammals is formed by a set of peripheral biological
   clocks coordinated by a light-entrainable pacemaker located in the
   suprachiasmatic nucleus. Daytime restricted feeding (DRF) modifies the
   circadian control and uncouples the light-dependent physiological
   rhythmicity, food access becoming the principal external time cue. In
   these conditions, an alternative biological clock is expressed, the
   food-entrainable oscillator (FEO). Glucocorticoid hormones are an
   important part of the humoral mechanisms in the daily synchronisation of
   the metabolic response of peripheral oscillators by the timing system. A
   peak of circulating corticosterone has been reported before food access
   in DRF protocols. In the present study we explored in the liver the 24 h
   variations of: (1) the subcellular distribution of glucocorticoid
   receptor (GCR), (2) the activities of the corticosterone-forming and
   NADPH-generating enzymes (11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1
   (11 beta-HSD-1) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH)), and, (3)
   parameters related with the urea cycle (circulating urea and activities
   of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase)
   elicited by DRF. The results showed that DRF promoted an increase of
   more than two times of the hepatic GCR, but exclusively in the cytosolic
   compartment, since the GCR in the nuclear fraction showed a reduction.
   No changes were observed in the activities of 11 beta-HSD-1 and H6PDH,
   but the rhythmicity of all of the urea cycle-related parameters was
   modified. It is concluded that liver glucocorticoid signalling and the
   urea cycle are responsive to feeding-restricted schedules and could be
   part of the FEO.

TI Histone H2A.Z Controls a Critical Chromatin Remodeling Step Required for
   DNA Double-Strand Break Repair
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Chromatin remodeling during DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is
   required to facilitate access to and repair of DSBs. This remodeling
   requires increased acetylation of histones and a shift in nucleosome
   organization to create open, relaxed chromatin domains. However, the
   underlying mechanism driving changes in nucleosome structure at DSBs is
   poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that histone H2A.Z is exchanged
   onto nucleosomes at DSBs by the p400 remodeling ATPase. H2A.Z exchange
   at DSBs shifts the chromatin to an open conformation and is required for
   acetylation and ubiquitination of histones and for loading of the brca1
   complex. H2A.Z exchange also restricts single-stranded DNA production by
   nucleases and is required for loading of the Ku70/Ku80 DSB repair
   protein. H2A.Z exchange therefore promotes specific patterns of histone
   modification and reorganization of the chromatin architecture, leading
   to the assembly of a chromatin template that is an efficient substrate
   for the DSB repair machinery.

TI Action control is mediated by prefrontal BDNF and glucocorticoid
   receptor binding
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Stressor exposure biases decision-making strategies from those based on
   the relationship between actions and their consequences to others
   restricted by stimulus-response associations. Chronic stressor exposure
   also desensitizes glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and diminishes
   motivation to acquire food reinforcement, although causal relationships
   are largely not established. We show that a history of chronic exposure
   to the GR ligand corticosterone or acute posttraining GR blockade with
   RU38486 makes rodents less able to perform actions based on their
   consequences. Thus, optimal GR binding is necessary for the
   consolidation of new response-outcome learning. In contrast, medial
   prefrontal (but not striatal) BDNF can account for stress-related
   amotivation, in that selective medial prefrontal cortical Bdnf knockdown
   decreases break-point ratios in a progressive-ratio task. Knockdown also
   increases vulnerability to RU38486. Despite the role of BDNF in
   dendritic spine reorganization, deep-layer spine remodeling does not
   obviously parallel progressive-ratio response patterns, but treatment
   with the Na(+)-channel inhibitor riluzole reverses
   corticosteroid-induced motivational deficits and restores prefrontal
   BDNF expression after corticosterone. We argue that when prefrontal
   neurotrophin systems are compromised, and GR-mediated
   hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feedback is desensitized (as in the
   case of chronic stress hormone exposure), amotivation and inflexible
   maladaptive response strategies that contribute to stress-related mood
   disorders result.

TI Anxiety correlates to decreased blood and prefrontal cortex IGF-1 levels
   in streptozotocin induced diabetes
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB It is well known that diabetes mellitus may cause neuropsychiatric
   disorders such as anxiety disorders. Diabetes may also cause reduced
   IGF-1 (insulin like growth factor-1) levels in brain and blood. The
   purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between
   diabetes induced anxiety and IGF-1 levels in diabetic rats. The anxiety
   levels of rats were assessed 2 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of
   streptozotocin. Diabetic rats had higher levels of anxiety, as they
   spent more time in closed branches in elevated-plus-maze-test and less
   time in the center cells of open-field-arena. Prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   IGF-1 levels and neuron numbers were decreased and apoptosis was
   increased in diabetic rats. Blood IGF-1 levels decreased in a time
   dependent fashion following streptozotocin injection while blood
   corticosterone levels increased. They had higher malondialdehyde levels
   and lower superoxide dismutase enzyme activity. Oxidative stress may
   negatively affect blood and PFC tissue IGF-1 levels. Reduction in IGF-1
   may cause PFC damage, which may eventually trigger anxiety in diabetic
   rats. Therapeutic strategies that increase blood and brain tissue IGF-1
   levels may be promising to prevent psychiatric sequelae of diabetes

TI How to Distinguish Methyl-Cytosine from Cytosine with High Fidelity
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Methylation of cytosines in the DNA is central to the epigenetic code.
   The patterns along the DNA formed by these chemical marks instruct the
   cell which proteins to express and their faithful maintenance after
   replication are vital to the organism's life. Although Dnmt1 is the
   enzyme catalyzing the methylation reaction, it was found that UHRF1
   (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING Anger domain 1) is the protein
   that actually recognizes hemi-methylated CpG sites. Nevertheless, the
   physical mechanism driving the strikingly robust distinction between
   hemi-methylated and unmethylated sites is not known. In this paper, we
   show that the large difference in the binding affinities of UHRF1 to
   these sites is possible not due to the presence of the methyl group
   itself but is a result of the accompanying changes in the distribution
   of the electrons around the cytosine ring. In particular, methylation
   reduces the dipole moment of cytosine and, as a consequence,
   unmethylated DNA in its unbound state in water is more stable than
   hemi-methylated DNA. Furthermore, the interaction energy of
   hemi-methylated DNA bound to UHRF1 with its surrounding is stronger than
   that of unmethylated DNA. Thus, the change in the electronic structure
   of cytosine upon methylation destabilizes the unbound state and
   stabilizes the bound state rendering discrimination with high fidelity
   possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI G9a Histone Methyltransferase Activity in Retinal Progenitors Is
   Essential for Proper Differentiation and Survival of Mouse Retinal Cells
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB In vertebrate retinal development, various transcription factors are
   known to execute essential activities in gene regulation. Although
   epigenetic modification is considered to play a pivotal role in retinal
   development, the exact in vivo role of epigenetic regulation is still
   poorly understood. We observed that G9a histone methyltransferase, which
   methylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), is substantially expressed in
   the mouse retina throughout development. To address in vivo G9a function
   in the mouse retina, we ablated G9a in retinal progenitor cells by
   conditional gene knock-out (G9a Dkk3 CKO). The G9a Dkk3 CKO retina
   exhibited severe morphological defects, including photoreceptor rosette
   formation, a partial loss of the outer nuclear layer, elevated cell
   death, and persistent cell proliferation. Progenitor cell-related genes,
   including several cyclins, Hes1, Chx10, and Lhx2, are methylated on
   histone H3K9 in the wild-type retina, but they were defective in H3K9
   methylation and improperly upregulated at late developmental stages in
   the G9a Dkk3 CKO retina. Notably, conditional depletion of G9a in
   postmitotic photoreceptor precursors (G9a Crx CKO) led to the
   development of an almost normal retina, indicating that G9a activity
   mainly in retinal progenitor cells, but not in photoreceptor precursors,
   is essential for normal terminal differentiation of and survival of the
   retina. Our results suggest that proper epigenetic marks in progenitor
   cells are important for subsequent appropriate terminal differentiation
   and survival of retinal cells by repressing progenitor cell-related
   genes in differentiating retinal cells.

TI Circadian Oscillations of Protein-Coding and Regulatory RNAs in a Highly
   Dynamic Mammalian Liver Epigenome
SO CELL METABOLISM
AB In the mouse liver, circadian transcriptional rhythms are necessary for
   metabolic homeostasis. Whether dynamic epigenomic modifications are
   associated with transcript oscillations has not been systematically
   investigated. We found that several antisense RNA, lincRNA, and microRNA
   transcripts also showed circadian oscillations in adult mouse livers.
   Robust transcript oscillations often correlated with rhythmic histone
   modifications in promoters, gene bodies, or enhancers, although promoter
   DNA methylation levels were relatively stable. Such integrative analyses
   identified oscillating expression of an antisense transcript (asPer2) to
   the gene encoding the circadian oscillator component Per2. Robust
   transcript oscillations often accompanied rhythms in multiple histone
   modifications and recruitment of multiple chromatin-associated clock
   components. Coupling of cycling histone modifications with nearby
   oscillating transcripts thus established a temporal relationship between
   enhancers, genes, and transcripts on a genome-wide scale in a mammalian
   liver. The results offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of
   metabolism, circadian clock, and chromatin modifications involved in
   metabolic homeostasis.

TI Germ cell abnormalities in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice do not
   correlate with blood glucose level
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB To assess the effect of streptozotocin induced hyperglycemia on germ
   cell integrity, DNA ploidy and methylation status for a period of two
   spermatogenesis cycles in adult male Swiss albino mice.
   Streptozotocin injected mice were monitored for hyperglycemia at a
   regular interval for a period of 36 and 72 days. The DNA integrity in
   epididymal spermatozoa was determined by the comet assay. Flow
   cytometric analysis was done in germ cells to assess the DNA ploidy. The
   global methylation analysis in germ cells was done by 5-methyl cytosine
   immunostaining.
   Streptozotocin administration successfully resulted in hyperglycemic
   response which significantly affected serum testosterone level, sperm
   DNA integrity and DNA ploidy at the end of 36 days. However, no changes
   were observed in either epididymal sperm concentration or germ cell
   methylation status. In contrast, at the end of 76 days, although serum
   testosterone level, sperm DNA integrity and DNA ploidy status were
   unperturbed significantly in hyperglycemic group, the epididymal sperm
   concentration and methylation status of preleptotene/zygotene cells were
   significantly altered. Importantly, an attempt to find out the
   association between the blood glucose levels and the abnormalities in
   hyperglycemic group failed to demonstrate any correlation.
   The germ cell abnormalities observed in hyperglycemic group could be
   interpreted as a primary effect of streptozotocin and not due to
   hyperglycemia. Our results call for further evaluation of streptozotocin
   before its application to study the hyperglycemic responses on male germ
   cells.

   results in temporally dynamic transcriptome regulation and

   1188-1200, 2012. First published October 30, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00097.2012.-While general effects of
   glucocorticoids are well established, the specific cellular mechanisms
   by which these hormones exert tissue-dependent effects continue to be
   elaborated. Diseases that demonstrate altered glucocorticoid signaling
   have been associated with alterations in astrocytes, yet relatively
   little is known about the effects of glucocorticoids upon this cell
   type. We have analyzed mRNA expression patterns following glucocorticoid
   treatment of mouse primary astrocyte cultures. Microarray analysis of
   cortical astrocyte cultures treated with dexamethasone over an
   eight-point, 24 h time course identified 854 unique genes with >=
   twofold change in mRNA expression at one or more time points. Clustering
   analysis associated subsets of these mRNA expression changes with gene
   ontology categories known to be impacted by glucocorticoids. Numerous
   mRNAs regulated by dexamethasone were also regulated by the natural
   ligand corticosterone; all of the mRNAs regulated >= twofold by
   corticosterone were substantially attenuated by cotreatment with the
   glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486. Of the mRNAs demonstrating >=
   twofold expression change in response to both glucocorticoids, 33 mRNAs
   were previously associated with glucocorticoid regulation, and 36 mRNAs
   were novel glucocorticoid targets. All genes tested by qPCR for
   glucocorticoid regulation in cortical astrocyte cultures were also
   regulated by glucocorticoids in hippocampal astrocyte cultures (18/18).
   Interestingly, a portion of glucocorticoid-regulated genes were
   astrocyte enriched; the percentage of astrocyte-enriched genes per total
   number of regulated genes was highest for the early time points and
   steadily decreased over the time course. These findings suggest that
   astrocytes in vitro may initially deploy cell type-specific patterns of
   mRNA regulatory responses to glucocorticoids and subsequently activate
   additional cell type-independent responses.

TI Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) inhibits keratinocyte differentiation through
   epigenetic mechanism
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB We recently identified Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), a mammalian homolog of
   Grainyhead in Drosophila, to be a novel transcription factor that
   regulates hTERT gene expression and enhances proliferation of normal
   human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). In the current study, we show that
   GRHL2 impairs keratinocyte differentiation through transcriptional
   inhibition of the genes clustered at the epidermal differentiation
   complex (EDC), located at chromosome 1q21. Gene expression profiling and
   subsequent in vitro assays revealed consistent downregulation of EDC
   genes, for example, IVL, KRT1, FLG, LCEs, and SPRRs, in NHEK expressing
   exogenous GRHL2. In vivo binding assay by chromatin immunoprecipitation
   revealed GRHL2 association at the promoter regions of its target genes,
   many of which belong to EDC. Exogenous GRHL2 expression also inhibited
   recruitment of histone demethylase Jmjd3 to the EDC gene promoters and
   enhanced the level of histone 3 Lys 27 trimethylation enrichment at
   these promoters. Survey of GRHL2 expression in human skin tissues
   demonstrated enhanced protein and mRNA levels in chronic skin lesions
   with impaired keratinocyte differentiation, for example, atopic
   dermatitis and psoriasis, compared with normal epidermis. These data
   indicate that GRHL2 impairs epidermal differentiation by inhibiting EDC
   gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms and support its role in
   the hyperproliferative skin diseases. Cell Death and Disease (2012) 3,

TI TIS21(/BTG2/PC3) accelerates the repair of DNA double strand breaks by
   enhancing Mre11 methylation and blocking damage signal transfer to the
   Chk2(T68)-p53(S20) pathway
SO DNA REPAIR
AB DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) occur more frequently in TIS21(-/-)
   mouse embryo fibroblasts than that in wild type MEFs (wt-MEFs).
   Therefore, the role TIS21 plays in the DNA damage response was
   investigated. Adenoviral transduction of Huh7 tumor cells with the TIS21
   gene accelerated the repair of DSBs induced by etoposide treatment as
   evaluated by clearance of gamma H2AX foci and the Comet assay. TIS21
   increased methylation of Mre11 and protein arginine methyltransferase 1
   (PRMT1) activity, leading to Mre11 activation in vitro and in vivo, as
   determined by immunoprecipitation and radiolabeling analyses. When
   downstream DNA damage response mediators were evaluated in various human
   cancer cells lines, TIS21 was found to strongly inhibit Chk2(T68) and
   p53(S20) phosphorylation by p-ATM(S1981) but not p53(S15). The loss of
   Chk2 activation after etoposide treatment reduced apoptosis in the cells
   by downregulating the expression of E2F1 and Bax. These data suggest
   that TIS21 regulates DSB repair and apoptosis. Expression of TIS21
   promoted the repair of DSBs and reduced apoptosis by blocking the damage
   signal from p-ATM(S1981) to Chk2(T68)-p53(S20) via the activation of
   Mre11 and PRMT1. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Human Papillomavirus DNA Methylation as a Potential Biomarker for

SO CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
AB Sexually transmitted carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infections
   are extraordinarily prevalent worldwide. However, most incident HPV
   infections clear within a few years, whereas a small minority persists
   to invasive cancer. Recent studies indicate that detection of methylated
   viral DNA may distinguish women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
   grade 2+ (CIN2+) from those with a carcinogenic HPV-type infection that
   shows no evidence of CIN2+. Several studies have reported a positive
   association between methylation of CpG sites in the L1 gene and CIN2+,
   although there are inconclusive results about methylation of CpG sites
   in the upstream regulatory region (URR). In this review, we summarize
   the current state of knowledge on HPV DNA methylation in cervical
   carcinogenesis, and discuss the merits of different methods used to
   measure HPV DNA methylation. To follow the promising leads, we suggest
   future studies to validate the use of methylated carcinogenic HPV DNA as
   a predictive and/or diagnostic biomarker for risk of cervical cancer
   among HPV-positive women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 21(12);

TI Corticosterone treatment impairs auditory fear learning and the
   dendritic morphology of the rat inferior colliculus
SO HEARING RESEARCH
AB Stress leads to secretion of the adrenal steroid hormone corticosterone
   (CORT). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic
   CORT administration on auditory and visual fear conditioning. Male
   Sprague-Dawley rats received CORT (400 mg/ml) in their drinking water
   for 10 consecutive days; this treatment induces stress levels of serum
   CORT. CORT impaired fear conditioning (F((1,28)) = 11.52, p < 0.01) and
   extinction (F((1,28)) = 4.86, p < 0.05) of auditory fear learning, but
   did not affect visual fear conditioning. In addition, we analyzed the
   CORT effects on the neuronal morphology of the inferior colliculus (flat
   neurons, auditory mesencephalon, a key brain area for auditory
   processing) and superior colliculus (wide-field neurons, related to
   visual processing) by Golgi stain. CORT decreased dendritic arborization
   of inferior colliculus neurons by approximately 50%, but did not affect
   superior colliculus neurons. Thus, CORT had more deleterious effects on
   the auditory fear processing than the visual system in the brain. (C)

TI Does translocation influence physiological stress in the desert
   tortoise?
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB Wildlife translocation is increasingly used to mitigate disturbances to
   animals or habitat due to human activities, yet little is known about
   the extent to which translocating animals causes stress. To understand
   the relationship between physiological stress and translocation, we
   conducted a multiyear study (20072009) using a population of desert
   tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) near Fort Irwin, California. Blood
   samples were collected from adult tortoises in three treatment groups
   (resident, translocated and control) for 1 year prior to and 2 years
   after translocation. Samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for
   plasma total corticosterone (CORT), a glucocorticoid hormone commonly
   associated with stress responses in reptiles. CORT values were analyzed
   in relation to potential covariates (animal sex, date, behavior,
   treatment, handling time, air temperature, home-range size,
   precipitation and annual plant production) among seasons and years. CORT
   values in males were higher than in females, and values for both varied
   monthly throughout the activity season and among years. Year and sex
   were strong predictors of CORT, and translocation explained little in
   terms of CORT. Based on these results, we conclude that translocation
   does not elicit a physiological stress response in desert tortoises.

TI Truncation of MIMT1 Gene in the PEG3 Domain Leads to Major Changes in
   Placental Gene Expression and Stillbirth in Cattle
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB We previously identified a microdeletion (Del) in the maternally
   imprinted PEG3 domain in cattle that results in loss of paternal MIMT1
   expression and causes late-term abortion and stillbirth. The mutation,
   when inherited from the sire, is semilethal for his progeny, with 85%
   mortality. Here we precisely delineate the deletion and describe
   comparative analyses of fetuses carrying the deletion with wild-type
   (WT) siblings. Global DNA methylation analysis of cotyledon tissue
   revealed greater global CpG methylation in fetuses with the deletion (P
   = 0.003). Gene expression microarray analyses identified increased
   NPSR1A, IL1RN, NOS3, IL4R, ZDHHC22, and SMOC2 expression in fetuses
   carrying the deletion and decreased GRID1, PLG, and IGF1 expression.
   Involvement of the NPSR1A, IL1RN, NOS3, and IL4R genes suggests that
   some form of restriction related to blood supply, perhaps hypoxemia, may
   play a role in the pathological mechanism. Also, imprinted genes known
   to play a role in mammalian prenatal development, specifically IGF2,
   DLK1, MEST, AST1, PEG3, APEG3, and H19, showed differential expression.
   The most striking difference was abundant abnormal expression of the
   neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1) gene in placental cotyledon tissue of
   7 of 11 MIMT1(Del/WT) fetuses. The similarity of this proportion to that
   of the semilethal mortality rate suggests that abnormal NPSR1 expression
   may be linked to death or survival of MIMT1(Del/WT) fetuses. NPSR1 is
   expressed as two isoforms (A and B), and isoform A was detected in
   MIMT1(Del/WT) cotyledons. NPSR1A is normally not expressed in placenta.
   Its role in the stillbirth phenomenon has yet to be elucidated, but it
   may provide a useful prognostic indicator.

TI SORL1 and SIRT1 mRNA expression and promoter methylation levels in aging
   and Alzheimer's Disease
SO NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL
AB Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most
   common cause of dementia among the elderly. Efforts have been made to
   understand the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the
   development of this disease. As SORL1 (sortilin-related receptor) and
   SIRT1 (sirtuin I) genes have been linked to AD pathogenesis, we aimed to
   investigate their mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation in post
   mortem brain tissues (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus)
   from healthy elderly subjects and AD patients. We also evaluated these
   levels in peripheral blood leukocytes from young, healthy elderly and AD
   patients, investigating whether there was an effect of age on these
   profiles. The comparative CT method by Real Time PCR and MALDI-TOF mass
   spectrometry were used to analyze gene expression and DNA methylation,
   respectively. SORL1 gene was differently expressed in the peripheral
   blood leukocytes and might act as a marker of aging in this tissue
   Furthermore, we found that SORL1 promoter DNA methylation might act as
   one of the mechanisms responsible for the differences in expression
   observed between blood and brain for both healthy elderly and AD
   patients groups. The impact of these studied genes on AD pathogenesis
   remains to be better clarified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in the California
   mouse (Peromyscus califomicus): Changes in baseline activity,
   reactivity, and fecal excretion of glucocorticoids across the diurnal
   cycle
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The California mouse, Peromyscus californicus, is an increasingly
   popular animal model in behavioral, neural, and endocrine studies, but
   little is known about its baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   axis activity or HPA responses to stressors. We characterized plasma
   corticosterone (CURT) concentrations in P. californicus under baseline
   conditions across the diurnal cycle, in response to pharmacological
   manipulation of the HPA axis, and in response to a variety of stressors
   at different times of day. In addition, we explored the use of fecal
   samples to monitor adrenocortical activity non-invasively. California
   mice have very high baseline levels of circulating CURT that change
   markedly over 24 h, but that do not differ between the sexes. This
   species may be somewhat glucocorticoid-resistant in comparison to other
   rodents as a relatively high dose of dexamethasone (5 mg/kg, s.c.) was
   required to suppress plasma CURT for 8 h post-injection. CURT responses
   to stressors and ACTH injection differed with time of day, as CURT
   concentrations were elevated more readily during the morning (inactive
   period) than in the evening (active period) when compared to
   time-matched control. Data from (3)H-CORT injection studies show that
   the time course for excretion of fecal CURT, or glucocorticoid
   metabolites, differs with time of injection. Mice injected in the
   evening excreted the majority of fecal radioactivity 2-4 h
   post-injection whereas mice injected during the morning did so at 14-16
   h post-injection. Unfortunately, the antibody we used does not
   adequately bind the most prevalent fecal glucocorticoid metabolites and
   therefore we could not validate its use for fecal assays. (C) 2012

TI Reactive oxygen species regulate ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression via
   miR-199a/125b and DNA methylation
SO EMBO REPORTS
AB Overexpression of ERBB2 or ERBB3 is associated with cancer development
   and poor prognosis. In this study, we show that reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) induce both ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression in vitro and in vivo. We
   also identify that miR-199a and miR-125b target ERBB2 and/or ERBB3 in
   ovarian cancer cells, and demonstrate that ROS inhibit miR-199a and
   miR-125b expression through increasing the promoter methylation of the
   miR-199a and miR-125b genes by DNA methyltransferase 1. These findings
   reveal that ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression is regulated by ROS via miR-199a
   and miR-125b downregulation and DNA hypermethylation.

TI Effect of the fungal mycotoxin patulin on the chromatin structure of
   fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe
SO JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB The fungal mycotoxin patulin is produced by several molds, especially by
   Aspergillus and Penicillium. The aim of this study was to clarify
   whether patulin causes alterations in plasma membrane permeability of
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe lead to cellular shrinkage charateristic to
   apoptosis or increases cell size indicating necrosis in cells.
   Transmission and scanning electronmicroscopy revealed that lower
   concentrations of patulin induced cellular shrinkage and blebbing,
   higher concentration caused expansion without cellular disruption.
   Large-scale morphological changes of individual cells were followed by
   time lapse video microscopy. Patulin caused the elongation and
   stickiness of cells or rounded up their shapes. To visualize chromatin
   structures of S. pombe nuclei upon patulin treatment, protoplasts were
   isolated from S. pombe and subjected to fluorescent microscopy.
   Chromatin changes in the presence of 50 mu M patulin concentration were
   characterized by elongated nuclei containing sticky fibrillary chromatin
   and enlarged round shaped nuclei trapped at the fibrillary stage of
   chromatin condensation. Short (60 min) incubation of S. pombe cells in
   the presence of high (500 mu M) patulin concentration generated patches
   of condensed chromatin bodies inside the nucleus and caused nuclear
   expansion, with the rest of chromatin remaining in fibrillary form.
   Longer (90 min, 500 mu M) incubation resulted in fewer highly condensed
   chromatin patches and in nuclear fragmentation. Although, high patulin
   concentration increased the size of S. pombe size, it did not lead to
   necrotic explosion of cells, neither did the fragmented nuclei resemble
   apoptotic bodies that would have indicated programmed cell death. All
   these morphological changes and the high rate of cell survival point to
   rapid adaptation and mixed type of fungistatic effects. ((c) 2012

TI Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is required for activating response to S(N) 1 DNA
   methylating agents
SO DNA REPAIR
AB S(N) 1 DNA methylating agents are genotoxic agents that methylate
   numerous nucleophilic centers within DNA including the O(6) position of
   guanine (O(6)meG). Methylation of this extracyclic oxygen forces
   mispairing with thymine during DNA replication. The mismatch repair
   (MMR) system recognizes these O(6)meG:T mispairs and is required to
   activate DNA damage response (DDR). Exonuclease I (EXO1) is a key
   component of MMR by resecting the damaged strand; however, whether EXO1
   is required to activate MMR-dependent DDR remains unknown. Here we show
   that knockdown of the mouse ortholog (mExol) in mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts (MEFs) results in decreased G2/M checkpoint response,
   limited effects on cell proliferation, and increased cell viability
   following exposure to the S(N) 1 methylating agent
   N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), establishing a phenotype
   paralleling MMR deficiency. MNNG treatment induced formation of
   gamma-H2AX foci with which EXO1 co-localized in MEFs, but mExo1-depleted
   MEFs displayed a significant diminishment of gamma-H2AX foci formation.
   mExo1 depletion also reduced MSH2 association with DNA duplexes
   containing G:T mismatches in vitro, decreased MSH2 association with
   alkylated chromatin in vivo, and abrogated MNNG-induced MSH2/CHK1
   interaction. To determine if nuclease activity is required to activate
   DDR we stably overexpressed a nuclease defective form of human EXO1
   (hEXO1) in mExol-depleted MEFs. These experiments indicated that
   expression of wildtype and catalytically null hEXO1 was able to restore
   normal response to MNNG. This study indicates that EXO1 is required to
   activate MMR-dependent DDR in response to S(N) 1 methylating agents;
   however, this function of EXO1 is independent of its nucleolytic
   activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Epigenetics and the developmental origins of inflammatory bowel diseases
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB The gut microbiota, the intestinal mucosa and the host immune system are
   among the large biological networks involved in the development of
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn disease (CD) and
   ulcerative colitis (UC). Host genetics and environmental factors can
   significantly modulate the interactive relationships among these
   biological systems and influence predilection toward IBD. High
   monozygotic twin discordance rates and the rapid rise in the prevalence
   of IBD indicate that environmental influences may be as important or
   even more important in their pathogenesis than genetic susceptibility.
   However, the nature and timing of environmental factors critical for
   inducing IBD remain largely unknown. The molecular mechanisms and the
   key biological component(s) that may be affected by such factors are
   also in question. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (the
   methylation of cytosines followed by a guanine in CpG dinucleotides) can
   be modified by environmental influences during finite developmental
   periods and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Mucosal DNA
   methylation can also react to changes in the commensal microbiota,
   underscoring the intercalating relationships among the large biological
   systems involved in gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, transient
   environmental influences during specific periods of development may
   induce critical change(s) in an isolated or concomitant fashion within
   the intestinal biomic networks and lead to increased susceptibility to
   IBD. The present review focuses on the emerging paradigm shift
   considering IBD to originate from critical environmental effects during
   pre- and postnatal development.

TI Androgen receptor association with mitotic chromatin - analysis with
   introduced deletions and disease-inflicting mutations
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB Sequence and structural anomalies in the gene for androgen receptor (AR)
   or its protein are associated with a range of clinical manifestations.
   Observations from living cells have shown that AR translocates to the
   nucleus upon ligand binding, where it forms typical nuclear foci that
   are considered as sites of gene transcription. Recently, we reported the
   ligand-mediated association of AR with mitotic chromatin and suggested
   its role in transcription memory, proposing a biopit model. In the
   present study, we show that each of the AR domains is obligatory for its
   association with mitotic chromatin and also that full-length AR is
   necessary for efficient association. In addition, deletion or point
   mutations in bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) revealed
   impaired localization, nuclear foci formation and abolished AR binding
   with mitotic chromatin. Interestingly, well-characterized AR-NLS mutants
   associated with the manifestation of pathological conditions (prostate
   cancer and androgen-insensitivity syndrome) exhibited differential
   behaviour on mitotic chromatin and also impaired receptor localization
   and nuclear foci formation. Finally, we report that, in addition to its
   functions in nuclear import, DNA binding, acetylation, N/C-termini
   interactions and transactivation, the AR-NLS region also functions as
   mitotic chromatin binding-determining region and has a novel role in the
   regulation of the AR association with mitotic chromatin.

TI A global DNA methylation and gene expression analysis of early human
   B-cell development reveals a demethylation signature and transcription
   factor network
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The epigenetic changes during B-cell development relevant to both normal
   function and hematologic malignancy are incompletely understood. We
   examined DNA methylation and RNA expression status during early B-cell
   development by sorting multiple replicates of four separate stages of
   pre-B cells derived from normal human fetal bone marrow and applied
   high-dimension DNA methylation scanning and expression arrays. Features
   of promoter and gene body DNA methylation were strongly correlated with
   RNA expression in multipotent progenitors (MPPs) both in a static state
   and throughout differentiation. As MPPs commit to pre-B cells, a
   predominantly demethylating phenotype ensues, with 79% of the 2966
   differentially methylated regions observed involving demethylation.
   Demethylation events were more often gene body associated rather than
   promoter associated; predominantly located outside of CpG islands; and
   closely associated with EBF1, E2F, PAX5 and other functional
   transcription factor (TF) sites related to B-cell development. Such
   demethylation events were accompanied by TF occupancy. After commitment,
   DNA methylation changes appeared to play a smaller role in B-cell
   development. We identified a distinct development-dependent
   demethylation signature which has gene expression regulatory properties
   for pre-B cells, and provide a catalog reference for the epigenetic
   changes that occur in pre-B-cell leukemia and other B-cell-related
   diseases.

TI The Incidence of Thyroid Cancer Is Affected by the Characteristics of a
   Healthcare System
SO JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the
   incidence of thyroid cancer and the characteristics of healthcare
   systems in OECD countries and to demonstrate that the increasing
   incidence of thyroid cancer is mainly due to overdiagnosis. We used a
   random effects panel model to regress the incidence of thyroid cancer on
   the characteristics of healthcare systems (i.e., share of public
   expenditure on health, mode of health financing, existence of referral
   system to secondary care, mode of payment to primary care physicians),
   controlling for macro context variables (i.e., GDP per capita,
   educational level) on a country level. Data were derived from 34 OECD
   countries for 2002 and 2008. The share of public expenditure on health
   was negatively associated with the incidence of thyroid cancer. However,
   it had no statistically significant effect on the mortality of thyroid
   cancer and on the incidence of stomach and lung cancer. In the case of
   colorectal cancer, it had a positive effect on the incidence rate. The
   upward trend of the incidence of thyroid cancer is closely related to
   the healthcare system that permits overdiagnosis. Increases in the
   proportion of public financing may help reduce the overdiagnosis of
   thyroid cancer.

TI Autophagy induction of reversine on human follicular thyroid cancer
   cells
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB The incurable differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), poorly differentiated
   thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) are the most
   aggressive in all of the thyroid cancers. Unfortunately, there are
   almost no effective therapies. A novel and effective treatment is
   urgently needed to develop. Recently, reversine, a small synthetic
   purine analogue, has been reported to be effective in human thyroid
   cancer suppression through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. In
   this study, we performed an in vitro evaluation of reversine on
   autophagy activation, one of the programmed cell death, and the related
   mechanisms in human follicular thyroid cancer cell line WRO. Incubation
   of WRO cells with reversine induced autophagosome formation in a short
   time treatment. LC3-II overexpression in a dosage-dependent manner with
   reversine treatment was demonstrated in the autophagy activation.
   Moreover, reversine suppressed Akt/mTOR related signaling pathway
   activation, a major pathway for autophagy activation, was also revealed
   in WRO cells. Our data demonstrated that reversine is effective to
   induce autophagy. Moreover, the LC3-II overexpression and the p62
   protein were degraded in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the
   autophagic flux has happened in the reversine treated WRO cells. In
   addition, the activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6 K related pathways were shown
   to be reduced, suggesting these pathways may involve in the reversine
   mediated autophagy induction. Reversine is therefore worthy of further
   investigation in clinical therapeutics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI LARVAL COMPETENCY OF RED ABALONE (HALIOTIS RUFESCENS): A NEW TIMEFRAME
   FOR LARVAL DISTRIBUTION
SO JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH
AB Settling cues in the form of coralline algae were presented to groups of
   hatchery-reared red abalone (Haliolis rufescens, Swainson 1822) larvae
   daily from day 4 to day 32 posthatch (temperature, 14 degrees C).
   Survival of postlarval abalone after settlement was monitored for 30
   days to quantify the effect of delayed metamorphosis on the subsequent
   survival of benthic juvenile abalone. After exposure to live coralline
   algae, an average of 85% of the larvae metamorphosed and settled the
   following day. The number of settled postlarvae increased gradually the
   longer the settling cue was withheld. Postsettlement juveniles were
   raised in individual containers on mixed diatoms for up to 34 days. Red
   abalone larvae remained competent to settle 32 days after fertilization.
   Larvae that metamorphosed from day 4 through day 19 had longer survival
   during the next 30 days (average, 19%) than those presented with a
   settling cue from day 20 to day 32 (average, 8%). Statistical analysis
   using a threshold cut point indicated that the 20-day threshold marked a
   significant change in subsequent postlarval survival. A receiver
   operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the 20-day cut
   point predicted high or low future survival of postmetamorphic abalone
   73.4% of the time. Larvae that swam for less than 20 days had
   postmetamorphic survival of 8 days or more, whereas survival was 7 days
   or less for postmetamorphic abalone that had swam previously for 20-32
   days. A larval competency period of 20 days is significantly longer than
   the 5-7-day larval stage often used to estimate transport times for this
   species.

TI Profibrotic Role of miR-154 in Pulmonary Fibrosis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB In this study, we explored the regulation and the role of up-regulated
   microRNAs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive
   interstitial lung disease of unknown origin. We analyzed the expression
   of microRNAs in IPF lungs and identified 43 significantly upregulated
   microRNAs. Twenty-four of the 43 increased microRNAs were localized to
   the chromosome 14q32 microRNA cluster. We validated the increased
   expression of miR-154, miR-134, miR-299-5p, miR-410, miR-382,
   miR-409-3p, miR-487b, miR-31, and miR-127 by quantitative RT-PCR and
   determined that they were similarly expressed in embryonic lungs. We did
   not find evidence for differential methylation in this region, but
   analysis of transcription factor binding sites identified multiple
   SMAD3-binding elements in the 14q32 microRNA cluster. TGF-beta 1
   stimulation of normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) caused up-regulation
   of microRNAs on chr14q32 that were also increased in IPF lungs.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of SMAD3 to the putative
   promoter of miR-154. Mir-154 was increased in IPF fibroblasts, and
   transfection of NHLF with miR-154 caused significant increases in cell
   proliferation and migration. The increase in proliferation induced by
   TGF-beta was not observed when NHLF or IPF fibroblasts were transfected
   with a mir-154 inhibitor. Transfection with miR-154 caused activation of
   the WNT pathway in NHLF. ICG-001 and XAV939, inhibitors of the
   WNT/beta-catenin pathway, reduced the proliferative effect of miR-154.
   The potential role of miR-154, one of multiple chr14q32 microRNA cluster
   members up-regulated in IPF and a regulator of fibroblast migration and
   proliferation, should be further explored in IPF.

TI Sequence characterization, in silico mapping and cytosine methylation
   analysis of markers linked to apospory in Paspalum notatum
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB In previous studies we reported the identification of several AFLP, RAPD
   and RFLP molecular markers linked to apospory in Paspalum notatum. The
   objective of this work was to sequence these markers, obtain their
   flanking regions by chromosome walking and perform an in silica mapping
   analysis in rice and maize. The nnethylation status of two
   apospory-related sequences was also assessed using methylation-sensitive
   RFLP experiments. Fourteen molecular markers were analyzed and several
   protein-coding sequences were identified. Copy number estimates and RFLP
   linkage analysis showed that the sequence PnMAI3 displayed 2-4 copies
   per genome and linkage to apospory. Extension of this marker by
   chromosome walking revealed an additional protein-coding sequence
   mapping in silica in the apospory-syntenic regions of rice and maize.
   Approximately 5 kb corresponding to different markers were characterized
   through the global sequencing procedure. A more refined analysis based
   on sequence information indicated synteny with segments of chromosomes 2
   and 12 of rice and chromosomes 3 and 5 of maize. Two loci associated
   with apomixis locus were tested in methylation-sensitive RFLP
   experiments using genomic DNA extracted from leaves. Although both
   target sequences were methylated no methylation polymorphisms associated
   with the mode of reproduction were detected.

TI Core Histone Charge and Linker Histone H1 Effects on the Chromatin
   Structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe
SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Histones are highly conserved proteins among eukaryotes. However, yeast
   histones are more divergent in their sequences. In particular, the
   histone tail regions of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
   have fewer lysine residues, making their charges less positive than
   those of higher eukaryotes. In addition, the S. pombe chromatin lacks
   linker histones. How these factors affected yeast chromatin folding was
   analysed by biochemical reconstitution in combination with atomic force
   microscopy. Reconstitution of a nucleosome array showed that S. pombe
   chromatin has a more open structure similar to reconstituted human
   acetylated chromatin. The S. pombe nucleosomal array formed thinner
   fibers than those of the human nucleosomal array in the presence of
   mammalian linker histone H1. Such S. pombe fibers were more comparable
   to human acetylated fibers. These findings suggest that the core histone
   charges would determine the intrinsic characteristics of S. pombe
   chromatin and affect inter-nudeosomal interactions.

TI Dnmt3a Protects Active Chromosome Domains against Cancer-Associated
   Hypomethylation
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Changes in genomic DNA methylation patterns are generally assumed to
   play an important role in the etiology of human cancers. The Dnmt3a
   enzyme is required for the establishment of normal methylation patterns,
   and mutations in Dnmt3a have been described in leukemias. Deletion of
   Dnmt3a in a K-ras-dependent mouse lung cancer model has been shown to
   promote tumor progression, which suggested that the enzyme might
   suppress tumor development by stabilizing DNA methylation patterns. We
   have used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to comprehensively
   characterize the methylomes from Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient
   mouse lung tumors. Our results show that profound global methylation
   changes can occur in K-ras-induced lung cancer. Dnmt3a wild-type tumors
   were characterized by large hypomethylated domains that correspond to
   nuclear lamina-associated domains. In contrast, Dnmt3a-deficient tumors
   showed a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further data analysis revealed
   that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active
   chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show moderate levels
   of gene deregulation in these domains. In summary, our results uncover
   conserved features of cancer methylomes and define the role of Dnmt3a in
   maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.

TI Chromatin Patterns of Immature Canine Oocytes after In Vitro Maturation
SO REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB Contents In canine species, in vitro maturation (IVM) rates of oocytes
   collected from anoestrous ovaries are low (<20%). Several IVM media have
   been tested without significant improvements. A critical step in the
   evaluation of culture conditions is the observation of the meiotic stage
   reached by the oocytes. The present study was designed to investigate
   the chromatin patterns of in vitro matured oocytes by visualizing
   Germinal Vesicle (GV) and Germinal Vesicle Breakdown (GVBD) structures
   at 72 h of IVM. Nuclear stages of 1678 oocytes were evaluated by
   confocal microscopy after IVM. 1204 oocytes were non-degenerated, and
   94.4% were still immature and at GV stage. Five different patterns of
   chromatin configuration were observed. Higher percentages of oocytes
   with unmodified GV and with diffuse (58%; Type A) and filamentous
   chromatin (19%; Type B) were observed in comparison with those with
   modifications in the GV such as patched chromatin (12.5%; Type C),
   surrounded-nucleolus (3%; Type D) and in vivo type chromatin/fully
   grouped chromatin (2.5%; Type E). These results indicate that GVBD
   (absence of nucleolus, nucleus breakdown) is rarely observed in vitro.
   The percentage of type C-D-E GVs and MI (meiotic resumption) and of MII
   (completion of meiosis) can be used to evaluate meiotic resumption after
   IVM. Our results indicate that although a low number of in vitro matured
   oocytes exhibit the chromatin configurations observed in in vivo
   collected oocytes, chromatin changes in the GV can be induced during
   IVM.

TI Hollowing or cavitation during follicular lumen formation in the
   differentiating thyroid of grass snake Natrix natrix L. (Lepidosauria,
   Serpentes) embryos? An ultrastructural study
SO ZOOLOGY
AB The mechanism of follicular lumen differentiation during thyroid gland
   morphogenesis in vertebrate classes is still unclear and the current
   knowledge regarding the origin and the mechanism of follicular lumen
   formation during thyroid differentiation in reptiles is especially poor.
   The present study reports on an ultrastructural investigation of thyroid
   follicle formation and follicular lumen differentiation in grass snake
   (Natrix natrix L) embryos. The results of this study show that the
   earliest morphogenesis of the presumptive thyroid follicles in grass
   snake embryos appears to be similar to that described in embryos of
   other vertebrate classes; however, differences appeared during the later
   stages of its differentiation when the follicular lumen was formed. The
   follicular lumen in grass snake embryos was differentiated by
   cavitation; during thyroid follicle formation, a population of centrally
   located cells was cleared through apoptosis to form the lumen. This
   manner of follicular lumen differentiation indicates that it has an
   extracellular origin. It cannot be excluded that other types of
   programmed cell death also occur during follicular lumen formation in
   this snake species. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Mutations in two non-canonical Arabidopsis SWI2/SNF2 chromatin
   remodeling ATPases cause embryogenesis and stem cell maintenance defects
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPases play important roles in plant and
   metazoan development. Whereas metazoans generally encode one or two
   SWI2/SNF2 ATPase genes, Arabidopsis encodes four such chromatin
   regulators: the well-studied BRAHMA and SPLAYED ATPases, as well as two
   closely related non-canonical SWI2/SNF2 ATPases, CHR12 and CHR23. No
   developmental role has as yet been described for CHR12 and CHR23. Here,
   we show that although strong single chr12 or chr23 mutants are
   morphologically indistinguishable from the wild type, chr12 chr23 double
   mutants cause embryonic lethality. The double mutant embryos fail to
   initiate root and shoot meristems, and display few and aberrant cell
   divisions. Weak double mutant embryos give rise to viable seedlings with
   dramatic defects in the maintenance of both the shoot and the root stem
   cell populations. Paradoxically, the stem cell defects are correlated
   with increased expression of the stem cell markers WUSCHEL and WOX5.
   During subsequent development, the meristem defects are partially
   overcome to allow for the formation of very small, bushy adult plants.
   Based on the observed morphological defects, we named the two chromatin
   remodelers MINUSCULE 1 and 2. Possible links between minu1 minu2 defects
   and defects in hormone signaling and replication-coupled chromatin
   assembly are discussed.

TI CASA derived human sperm abnormalities: correlation with chromatin
   packing and DNA fragmentation
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of
   morphokinetic abnormalities of human spermatozoa on chromatin packing
   and DNA integrity and possible beneficial effects of sperm selection in
   ICSI.
   Semen samples from 1002 patients were analysed for morphology and
   motility using CASA. Protamine status and DNA fragmentation were
   analysed by chromomycin A3 staining and sperm chromatin dispersion assay
   respectively.
   Sperms with elongated, thin, round, pyri, amorphous, micro and macro
   forms were significantly higher in teratozoospermic and
   oligoasthenoteratozoospermic groups. Significant difference in chromatin
   packing and DNA fragmentation index was observed in these abnormal
   groups compared with normal. Similarly significant correlation was also
   seen between abnormal motility parameters and DNA fragmentation index in
   asthenozoospermic group compared with normal.
   Specific abnormal morphological forms have higher incidence of chromatin
   packing abnormalities and DNA fragmentation. Using these sperms in ICSI
   might have an impact on fertilization, embryo development and abortion
   rates. These can be selectively avoided during ICSI procedure to improve
   ART outcome.

TI Effects of choline on sodium arsenite-induced neural tube defects in
   chick embryos
SO FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB Arsenic passes through the placenta and accumulates in the
   neuroepithelium of embryo, whereby inducing congenital malformations
   such as neural tube defects (NTDs) in animals. Choline (CHO), a
   methyl-rich nutrient, functions as a methyl donor to participate in
   methyl group metabolism. Arsenic methylation has been regarded as a
   detoxification process and choline (CHO) is the major source of
   methyl-groups. However, whether CHO intake reverses the abnormal embryo
   development induced by sodium arsenite (SA) and the relationship between
   CHO intake and arsenite-induced NTDs are still unclear. In this study,
   we used chick embryos as animal model to investigate the effects of SA
   and CHO supplementation on the early development of nervous system. Our
   results showed that the administration of SA led to reduction in embryo
   viability, embryo body weight and extraembryonic vascular area,
   accompanied by a significantly increased incidence of the failed closure
   of the caudal end of the neural tube. CHO, at low dose (25 mu g/mu L),
   reversed the decrease in embryo viability and the increase in the failed
   closure of the caudal end of the neural tube, which were induced by SA.
   In addition, CHO (25 mu g/mu L) inhibited not only the SA-induced cell
   apoptosis by up-regulating Bcl-2 level, but also the global DNA
   methylation by increasing the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3a. However,
   less significant difference was found between the embryos co-treated
   with SA and CHO (50 mu g/mu L) and the ones treated with SA alone. Taken
   together, these findings suggest that low dose CHO could protect chick
   embryos from arsenite-induced NTDs by a possible mechanism related to
   the methyl metabolism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   total of 60.5% and 65.3% of the accumulated As in the cells of T.
   asperellum SM-12F1 and P. janthinellum SM-12F4, respectively, was
   As(III), followed by 31.3% and 32.4% DMA (dimethylarsinic acid), 8.3%
   and 2.3% MMA (monomethylarsonic acid), respectively. However, for F.
   oxysporum CZ-8F1, 54.5% of the accumulated As was As(III), followed by
   37.8% MMA and 7.7% As(V). The reduction and methylation of As(V) formed
   As(III), MMA, and DMA as the primacy products, and the reduction of
   As(V) might be more easily processed than the methylation. These results
   will help to understanding the mechanisms of As detoxification and its

TI Activation of tachykinin, neurokinin 3 receptors affects chromatin
   structure and gene expression by means of histone acetylation
SO PEPTIDES
AB The tachykinin, neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) is a g-protein coupled
   receptor that is broadly distributed in the nervous system and exerts
   its diverse physiological actions through multiple signaling pathways.
   Despite the role of the receptor system in a range of biological
   functions, the effects of NOR activation on chromatin dynamics and gene
   expression have received limited attention. The present work determined
   the effects of senktide, a selective NK3R agonist, on chromatin
   organization, acetylation, and gene expression, using qRT-PCR, in a
   hypothalamic cell line (CLU 209) that expresses the NK3R Senktide (1 nM,
   10 nM) caused a relaxation of chromatin, an increase in global
   acetylation of histone H3 and H4, and an increase in the expression of a
   common set of genes involved in cell signaling, cell growth, and
   synaptic plasticity. Pretreatment with histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
   inhibitor (garcinol and 2-methylene y-butylactone), that inhibits p300,
   p300/CREB binding protein (CBP) associated factor (PCAF), and GCN 5,
   prevented the senktide-induced increase in expression of most, but not
   all, of the genes upregulated in response to 1 nM and 10 nM senktide.
   Treatment with 100 nM had the opposite effect: a reduction in chromatin
   relaxation and decreased acetylation. The expression of four genes was
   significantly decreased and the HAT inhibitor had a limited effect in
   blocking the upregulation of genes in response to 100 nM senktide.
   Activation of the NK3R appears to recruit multiple pathways, including
   acetylation, and possibly histone deactylases, histone methylases, or
   DNA methylases to affect chromatin structure and gene expression. (C)

TI Mechanisms of human histone and nucleic acid demethylases
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB The discovery that protein and nucleic acid demethylation is common
   opens up the possibility of 'methylation cycles' of functional
   importance, including in the regulation of gene expression. The
   mechanisms of known demethylases can be broadly divided into those
   involving nucleophilic catalysis and those involving oxidative
   catalysis. The latter group appear more common; they produce
   formaldehyde as a co-product. Nucleophilic demethylases include those
   proceeding via irreversible S-methylation and methyl esterases. In
   addition to the direct reversal of methylation, demethylation can occur
   concurrent with loss of other groups, such as in methylarginine
   hydrolysis, oxidation of N(epsilon)-methyllysine to allysine, and
   indirectly, for example via base-excision repair. We discuss chemically
   viable mechanisms for biological demethylation and summarise mechanistic
   knowledge of the major known families of demethylases.

TI Chronic social defeat up-regulates expression of the serotonin
   transporter in rat dorsal raphe nucleus and projection regions in a
   glucocorticoid-dependent manner
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY
AB Chronic stress and dysfunction of the serotonergic system in the brain
   have been considered two of the major risks for development of
   depression. In this study, adult Fischer 344 rats were subjected to a
   regimen of chronic social defeat (CSD). To mimic stressful conditions,
   some rats were not exposed to CSD, but instead treated with
   corticosterone (CORT) in oral solution while maintained in their home
   cage. Protein levels of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the dorsal
   raphe nucleus (DRN), hippocampus, frontal cortex, and amygdala were
   examined by Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining. The results
   showed that CSD up-regulated SERT protein levels in the DRN,
   hippocampus, frontal cortex, and amygdala regions. This up-regulation
   was abolished or prevented by adrenalectomy, or treatment with
   antagonists of corticosteroid receptors mifepristone and spironolactone,
   alone or in combination. Similarly, up-regulated SERT protein levels in
   these brain regions were also observed in rats treated with oral CORT
   ingestion, which was analogously prevented by treatment with
   mifepristone and spironolactone. Furthermore, both CSD- and CORT-induced
   up-regulation of SERT protein levels in the DRN and three brain regions
   were attenuated by simultaneous treatment with fluoxetine, an
   antidepressant that specifically inhibits serotonin reuptake. The
   results indicate that up-regulation in SERT protein levels in the DRN
   and forebrain limbic structures caused by CSD regimen was mainly
   motivated by CORT through corticosteroid receptors. The present findings
   demonstrate that chronic stress is closely correlated with the
   serotonergic system by acting on the regulation of the SERT expression
   in the DRN and its projection regions, which may contribute to the
   development of depression.

TI A Novel Regulatory Factor Recruits the Nucleosome Remodeling Complex to
   Wingless Integrated (Wnt) Signaling Gene Promoters in Mouse Embryonic
   Stem Cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex is required
   for modulating the transcription of essential pluripotency genes in ESC
   self-renewal. MBD3 is considered a key player in the formation of a
   functional NuRD complex. The recruitment of MBD3 to methylated promoters
   may require other prerequisite factors. We show that cyclin-dependent
   kinase 2-associated protein 1 (CDK2AP1), an essential gene for early
   embryonic development, plays a role in pluripotency of ESC by engaging
   MBD3 to the promoter region of Wnt signaling genes. The occupancy of
   MBD3 on several promoters of Wnt genes was significantly lost in the
   absence of CDK2AP1, resulting in hyperactivation of Wnt. We propose that
   the transcriptional modulation of the Wnt pathway mediated by NuRD
   requires the presence of essential auxiliary components such as CDK2AP1,
   which may aid the association of the complex with specific focal regions
   of the target promoters.

TI Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors differentially regulate
   NF-kappaB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in murine
   BV-2 microglial cells
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION
AB Background: Microglia, the resident macrophage-like cells in the brain,
   regulate innate immune responses in the CNS to protect neurons. However,
   excessive activation of microglia contributes to neurodegenerative
   diseases. Corticosteroids are potent modulators of inflammation and
   mediate their effects by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Here, the coordinated activities of GR
   and MR on the modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)
   pathway in murine BV-2 microglial cells were studied.
   Methods: BV-2 cells were treated with different corticosteroids in the
   presence or absence of MR and GR antagonists. The impact of the
   glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
   type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) was determined by incubating cells with
   11-dehydrocorticosterone, with or without selective inhibitors.
   Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor receptor 2
   (TNFR2), and 11 beta-HSD1 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and IL-6 protein
   expression by ELISA. NF-kappa B activation and translocation upon
   treatment with various corticosteroids were visualized by western
   blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and translocation assays.
   Results: GR and MR differentially regulate NF-kappa B activation and
   neuroinflammatory parameters in BV-2 cells. By converting inactive
   11-dehydrocorticosterone to active corticosterone, 11 beta-HSD1
   essentially modulates the coordinated action of GR and MR. Biphasic
   effects were observed for 11-dehydrocorticosterone and corticosterone,
   with an MR-dependent potentiation of IL-6 and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression and NF-kappa B activation at
   low/moderate concentrations and a GR-dependent suppression at high
   concentrations. The respective effects were confirmed using the MR
   ligand aldosterone and the antagonist spironolactone as well as the GR
   ligand dexamethasone and the antagonist RU-486. NF-kappa B activation
   could be blocked by spironolactone and the inhibitor of NF-kappa B
   translocation Cay-10512. Moreover, an increased expression of TNFR2 was
   observed upon treatment with 11-dehydrocorticosterone and aldosterone,
   which was reversed by 11 beta-HSD1 inhibitors and/or spironolactone and
   Cay-10512.
   Conclusions: A tightly coordinated GR and MR activity regulates the
   NF-kappa B pathway and the control of inflammatory mediators in
   microglia cells. The balance of GR and MR activity is locally modulated
   by the action of 11 beta-HSD1, which is upregulated by pro-inflammatory
   mediators and may represent an important feedback mechanism involved in
   resolution of inflammation.

TI Nucleosome-depleted chromatin gaps recruit assembly factors for the H3.3
   histone variant
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Most nucleosomes that package eukaryotic DNA are assembled during DNA
   replication, but chromatin structure is routinely disrupted in active
   regions of the genome. Replication-independent nucleosome replacement
   using the H3.3 histone variant efficiently repackages these regions, but
   how histones are recruited to these sites is unknown. Here, we use an
   inducible system that produces nucleosome-depleted chromatin at the
   Hsp70 genes in Drosophila to define steps in the mechanism of nucleosome
   replacement. We find that the Xnp chromatin remodeler and the Hira
   histone chaperone independently bind nucleosome-depleted chromatin.
   Surprisingly, these two factors are only displaced when new nucleosomes
   are assembled. H3.3 deposition assays reveal that Xnp and Hira are
   required for efficient nucleosome replacement, and double-mutants are
   lethal. We propose that Xnp and Hira recognize exposed DNA and serve as
   a binding platform for the efficient recruitment of H3.3 predeposition
   complexes to chromatin gaps. These results uncover the mechanisms by
   which eukaryotic cells actively prevent the exposure of DNA in the
   nucleus.

TI New Technologies and Procedures for Cervical Cancer Screening
SO VACCINE
AB The clearly higher sensitivity and reproducibility of human
   papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing for high-grade cervical intraepithelial
   neoplasia (CIN) has led to widespread calls to introduce it as the
   primary screening test. The main concern has been its lower specificity,
   due to the fact that it cannot separate transient from persistent
   infections, and only the latter are associated with an increased risk of
   high-grade CIN and cancer. Thus, even proponents of HPV testing
   generally only recommend it for women over the age of 30 years (or in
   some cases 35 years). If HPV testing is to reach its full potential, new
   approaches with better specificity are needed, either as triage tests
   for HPV positive women or, if the high sensitivity of HPV DNA testing
   can be maintained, as alternate primary screening modalities. Approaches
   that may useful in this regard, especially as triage tests, include HPV
   typing, methylation (and consequent silencing) of host and viral genes,
   and new cytologic methods, such as p16(INK4a) staining, which attempt to
   identify proliferating cells. At an earlier stage of development are
   direct methods based on detection of HPV E6 or E7 proteins. Recent
   progress and current status of these methods is discussed in this
   chapter. The current status of visual inspection (VIA and VILI) methods
   is also surveyed and progress on self-sampling is reviewed. This article

TI Single-cell analysis of Daxx and ATRX-dependent transcriptional
   repression
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB Histone H3.3 is a constitutively expressed H3 variant implicated in the
   epigenetic inheritance of chromatin structures. Recently, the
   PML-nuclear body (PML-NB)/Nuclear Domain 10 (ND10) proteins, Daxx and
   ATRX, were found to regulate replication-independent histone H3.3
   chromatin assembly at telomeres and pericentric heterochromatin. As it
   is not completely understood how PML-NBs/ND10s regulate transcription
   and resistance to viral infection, we have used a CMV-promoter-regulated
   inducible transgene array, at which Daxx and ATRX are enriched, to
   delineate the mechanisms through which they regulate transcription. When
   integrated into HeLa cells, which express both Daxx and ATRX, the array
   is refractory to activation. However, transcription can be induced when
   ICP0, the HSV-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase required to reverse latency, is
   expressed. As ATRX and Daxx are depleted from the activated array in
   ICP0-expressing HeLa cells, this suggests that they are required to
   maintain a repressed chromatin environment. As histone H3.3 is strongly
   recruited to the ICP0-activated array but does not co-localize with the
   DNA, this also suggests that chromatin assembly is blocked during
   activation. The conclusion that the Daxx and ATRX pathway is required
   for transcriptional repression and chromatin assembly at this site is
   further supported by the finding that an array integrated into the
   ATRX-negative U2OS cell line can be robustly activated and that histone
   H3.3 is similarly recruited and unincorporated into the chromatin.
   Therefore, this study has important implications for understanding gene
   silencing, viral latency and PML-NB/ND10 function.

TI Expression of KCNQ1OT1, CDKN1C, H19, and PLAGL1 and the methylation
   patterns at the KvDMR1 and H19/IGF2 imprinting control regions is
   conserved between human and bovine
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Background: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a loss-of-imprinting
   pediatric overgrowth syndrome. The primary features of BWS include
   macrosomia, macroglossia, and abdominal wall defects. Secondary features
   that are frequently observed in BWS patients are hypoglycemia, nevus
   flammeus, polyhydramnios, visceromegaly, hemihyperplasia, cardiac
   malformations, and difficulty breathing. BWS is speculated to occur
   primarily as the result of the misregulation of imprinted genes
   associated with two clusters on chromosome 11p15.5, namely the KvDMR1
   and H19/IGF2. A similar overgrowth phenotype is observed in bovine and
   ovine as a result of embryo culture. In ruminants this syndrome is known
   as large offspring syndrome (LOS). The phenotypes associated with LOS
   are increased birth weight, visceromegaly, skeletal defects,
   hypoglycemia, polyhydramnios, and breathing difficulties. Even though
   phenotypic similarities exist between the two syndromes, whether the two
   syndromes are epigenetically similar is unknown. In this study we use
   control Bos taurus indicus X Bos taurus taurus F1 hybrid bovine concepti
   to characterize baseline imprinted gene expression and DNA methylation
   status of imprinted domains known to be misregulated in BWS. This work
   is intended to be the first step in a series of experiments aimed at
   determining if LOS will serve as an appropriate animal model to study
   BWS.
   Results: The use of F1 B. t. indicus x B. t. taurus tissues provided us
   with a tool to unequivocally determine imprinted status of the regions
   of interest in our study. We found that imprinting is conserved between
   the bovine and human in imprinted genes known to be associated with BWS.
   KCNQ1OT1 and PLAGL1 were paternally-expressed while CDKN1C and H19 were
   maternally-expressed in B. t. indicus x B. t. taurus F1 concepti. We
   also show that in bovids, differential methylation exists at the KvDMR1
   and H19/IGF2 ICRs.
   Conclusions: Based on these findings we conclude that the imprinted gene
   expression of KCNQ1OT1, CDKN1C, H19, and PLAGL1 and the methylation
   patterns at the KvDMR1 and H19/IGF2 ICRs are conserved between human and
   bovine. Future work will determine if LOS is associated with
   misregulation at these imprinted loci, similarly to what has been
   observed for BWS.

TI Right thyroid hemiagenesis with adenoma and hyperplasia of parathyroid
   glands -case report
SO BMC ENDOCRINE DISORDERS
AB Background: Thyroid hemiagenesis is a rare anomaly, more commonly seen
   on the left side (ratio 4:1) and in females (ratio 3:1). The first to
   describe this anomaly was Handfield Jones in 1852.
   Case presentation: We present a 66 year old female patient with right
   thyroid hemiagenesis, parathyroid adenoma on the side of hemiagenesis
   and parathyroid hyperplasia on the contralateral side. The patient had
   neck pain and was diagnosed as Hashimto thyroiditis with
   hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid hormone, thyroglobulin antibodies
   (Tg-Ab) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab) were elevated. Neck
   ultrasound and technetium 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI)
   scintigraphy confirmed the right thyroid hemiagenesis, but not adenoma
   of parathyroid glands. Intraoperatively, right thyroid hemiagenesis was
   confirmed and left loboistmectomy was performed with removal of left
   inferior hyperplastic parathyroid gland. Postoperative PTH (parathyroid
   hormone) levels were within normal range. Five months after the
   operation PTH level was elevated again with calcium values at the upper
   limit. MIBI scintigraphy was performed again which showed increased
   accumulation of MIBI in the projection of the right parathyroid gland.
   Surgical reexploration of the neck and excision of the right upper
   parathyroid adenoma was performed which was located behind cricoid
   laryngeal cartilage. After surgery a normalization of calcium and PTH
   occured.
   Conclusion: From available literature we have not found the case that
   described parathyroid adenoma on the side of thyroid hemiagenesis, with
   parathyroid hyperplasia on the contralateral side.

TI O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in equine sarcoids: molecular
   and epigenetic analysis
SO BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Background: Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) types 1 and 2 are the only
   known papillomaviruses able to jump the species. In fact, BPVs 1/2
   induce neoplasia in their natural bovine host but infection is also
   associated to neoplastic skin lesions in equids termed sarcoids. The
   equine sarcoid is considered to be the most common equine cutaneous
   tumour worldwide for which no effective therapy is available. Very
   little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying
   tumourigenesis, although genes contributing to sarcoid development have
   been identified. Several studies associate the development of cancer to
   the loss of function of a number of oncosuppressor genes. In this study
   the putative role of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltrasferase (MGMT) was
   investigated for sarcoids. The expression of the oncosuppressor protein
   was assessed in normal and sarcoid cells and tissues. In addition, the
   DNA methylation profile was analysed to assess the role of epigenetic
   mechanism in regulation of MGMT expression.
   Results: A group of 15 equine sarcoids and two primary sarcoid cell
   lines (fibroblasts) were analyzed for the expression of MGMT protein by
   immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting
   techniques. The sarcoid cell line EqSO4b and the tumour samples showed a
   reduction or absence of MGMT expression. To investigate the causes of
   deregulated MGMT expression, ten samples were analyzed for the DNA
   methylation profile of the CpG island associated to the MGMT promoter.
   The analysis of 73 CpGs encompassing the region of interest showed in 1
   out of 10 (10%) sarcoids a pronouncedly altered methylation profile when
   compared to the control epidermal sample. Similarily the EqSO4b cell
   line showed an altered MGMT methylation pattern in comparison to normal
   fibroblasts.
   Conclusion: As previously demonstrated for the oncosuppressor gene FHIT,
   analysis of MGMT expression in sarcoid tissues and a sarcoid-derived
   fibroblast cell line further suggests that oncosuppressor silencing may
   be also involved in BPV-induced equine tumours. Abnormal DNA methylation
   seems to be one of the possible molecular mechanisms involved in the
   alteration of MGMT expression. Further studies are required to address
   other basic molecular mechanisms involved in reduced MGMT expression.
   This study underlines the possible role of DNA methylation in
   oncosuppressor inactivation in equine sarcoids.

TI Generation of functional thyroid from embryonic stem cells
SO NATURE
AB The primary function of the thyroid gland is to metabolize iodide by
   synthesizing thyroid hormones, which are critical regulators of growth,
   development and metabolism in almost all tissues. So far, research on
   thyroid morphogenesis has been missing an efficient stem-cell model
   system that allows for the in vitro recapitulation of the molecular and
   morphogenic events regulating thyroid follicular-cell differentiation
   and subsequent assembly into functional thyroid follicles. Here we
   report that a transient overexpression of the transcription factors
   NKX2-1 and PAX8 is sufficient to direct mouse embryonic stem-cell
   differentiation into thyroid follicular cells that organize into
   three-dimensional follicular structures when treated with thyrotropin.
   These in vitro-derived follicles showed appreciable iodide
   organification activity. Importantly, when grafted in vivo into athyroid
   mice, these follicles rescued thyroid hormone plasma levels and promoted
   subsequent symptomatic recovery. Thus, mouse embryonic stem cells can be
   induced to differentiate into thyroid follicular cells in vitro and
   generate functional thyroid tissue.

TI The effect of the follicular fluid on sperm chromatin quality in
   comparison with conventional media
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB BACKGROUND: Follicular fluid (FF) is biological fluid rich in nutrients,
   growth factors, hormones and may affect the sperm quality. Sperm washing
   has been done using conventional media in laboratory procedure so far.
   AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effects of FF on survival and
   maintenance of chromatin integrity post swim up.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each washed semen sample was divided into two
   parts; the control group was incubated in the media, and the
   experimental groups incubated in the media containing 10% follicular
   fluid. Smears were prepared after 20 min, 180 min, 24 hours and no
   incubation times. Sperm chromatin changes like protamine, histone, DNA
   denaturation, sperm chromatin stability and motility were evaluated at
   different times.
   RESULTS: Incubation of sperm in the follicular fluid increased sperms
   with normal histone, normal chromatin protamine and sperm with normal
   head size (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Administration of follicular fluid into the culture media
   of the sperms that had been separated by swim up method could improve
   the sperm quality. Further studies are recommended for understanding the
   mechanism of the structural change of the sperm chromatin.

TI Hi-C: A comprehensive technique to capture the conformation of genomes
SO METHODS
AB We describe a method, Hi-C, to comprehensively detect chromatin
   interactions in the mammalian nucleus. This method is based on
   Chromosome Conformation Capture, in which chromatin is crosslinked with
   formaldehyde, then digested, and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA
   fragments that are covalently linked together form ligation products.
   The ligation products contain the information of not only where they
   originated from in the genomic sequence but also where they reside,
   physically, in the 3D organization of the genome. In Hi-C, a
   biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction,
   enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions
   followed by deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi-C with next
   generation sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin
   interactions on an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi-C the
   power to both explore the biophysical properties of chromatin as well as
   the implications of chromatin structure for the biological functions of
   the nucleus. A massively parallel survey of chromatin interaction
   provides the previously missing dimension of spatial context to other
   genomic studies. This spatial context will provide a new perspective to
   studies of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal
   conditions and in disease. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Cryopreservation of Human Spermatozoa Decreases the Number of Motile
   Normal Spermatozoa, Induces Nuclear Vacuolization and Chromatin
   Decondensation
SO JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY
AB Even though cryopreservation of human spermatozoa is known to alter
   sperm motility and viability, it may also induce nuclear damages. The
   present study set out to determine whether or not cryopreservation
   alters motile sperm morphology under high magnification and/or is
   associated with chromatin decondensation. For 25 infertile men, we used
   high-magnification microscopy to determine the proportions of various
   types of motile spermatozoa before and after freezing-thawing:
   morphometrically normal spermatozoa with no vacuole (grade I), <= 2
   small vacuoles (grade II), at least 1 large vacuole or >2 small vacuoles
   (grade Ill), and morphometrically abnormal spermatozoa (grade IV). The
   spermatozoa's chromatin condensation and viability were also assessed
   before and after freezing-thawing. Cryopreservation induced sperm
   nuclear vacuolization. It decreased the proportion of grade I + II
   spermatozoa (P < .001). It induced a decrease in the sperm viability
   rate (P < .001) and increased the proportion of sperm with noncondensed
   chromatin (P < .001). The latter parameter was strongly correlated with
   sperm viability (r = 0.71; P < .001). However, even motile sperm
   presented a failure of chromatin condensation after freezing-thawing,
   because the proportion of sperm with noncondensed chromatin was
   correlated with high-magnification morphology (r -0.49 and 0.49 for the
   proportions of grade I + II and grades III + IV, respectively; P <
   .001). Cryopreservation alters the organelle morphology of motile human
   spermatozoa and induces sperm chromatin decondensation.
   High-magnification microscopy may be useful for evaluating frozen-thawed
   spermatozoa before use in assisted reproductive technology procedures
   (such as intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, and
   intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and for performing research on
   cryopreservation methods. If frozen-thawed sperm is to be used for
   intracytoplasmic sperm injection, morphological selection under high
   magnification may be of particular value.

TI Epigenetic Editing: targeted rewriting of epigenetic marks to modulate
   expression of selected target genes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Despite significant advances made in epigenetic research in recent
   decades, many questions remain unresolved, especially concerning cause
   and consequence of epigenetic marks with respect to gene expression
   modulation (GEM). Technologies allowing the targeting of epigenetic
   enzymes to predetermined DNA sequences are uniquely suited to answer
   such questions and could provide potent (bio)medical tools. Toward the
   goal of gene-specific GEM by overwriting epigenetic marks (Epigenetic
   Editing, EGE), instructive epigenetic marks need to be identified and
   their writers/erasers should then be fused to gene-specific DNA binding
   domains. The appropriate epigenetic mark(s) to change in order to
   efficiently modulate gene expression might have to be validated for any
   given chromatin context and should be (mitotically) stable. Various
   insights in such issues have been obtained by sequence-specific
   targeting of epigenetic enzymes, as is presented in this review.
   Features of such studies provide critical aspects for further improving
   EGE. An example of this is the direct effect of the edited mark versus
   the indirect effect of recruited secondary proteins by targeting
   epigenetic enzymes (or their domains). Proof-of-concept of expression
   modulation of an endogenous target gene is emerging from the few EGE
   studies reported. Apart from its promise in correcting
   disease-associated epi-mutations, EGE represents a powerful tool to
   address fundamental epigenetic questions.

TI Loss of the DNA Methyltransferase MET1 Induces H3K9 Hypermethylation at
   PcG Target Genes and Redistribution of H3K27 Trimethylation to
   Transposons in Arabidopsis thaliana
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9m2) and trimethylation of
   histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27m3) are two hallmarks of transcriptional
   repression in many organisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27m3 is
   targeted by Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins and is associated with silent
   protein-coding genes, while H3K9m2 is correlated with DNA methylation
   and is associated with transposons and repetitive sequences. Recently,
   ectopic genic DNA methylation in the CHG context (where H is any base
   except G) has been observed in globally DNA hypomethylated mutants such
   as met1, but neither the nature of the hypermethylated loci nor the
   biological significance of this epigenetic phenomenon have been
   investigated. Here, we generated high-resolution, genome-wide maps of
   both H3K9m2 and H3K27m3 in wild-type and met1 plants, which we
   integrated with transcriptional data, to explore the relationships
   between these two marks. We found that ectopic H3K9m2 observed in met1
   can be due to defects in IBM1-mediated H3K9m2 demethylation at some
   sites, but most importantly targets H3K27m3-marked genes, suggesting an
   interplay between these two silencing marks. Furthermore,
   H3K9m2/DNA-hypermethylation at these PcG targets in met1 is coupled with
   a decrease in H3K27m3 marks, whereas CG/H3K9m2 hypomethylated
   transposons become ectopically H3K27m3 hypermethylated. Our results bear
   interesting similarities with cancer cells, which show global losses of
   DNA methylation but ectopic hypermethylation of genes previously marked
   by H3K27m3.

TI Epigenetics of Host-Pathogen Interactions: The Road Ahead and the Road
   Behind
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB A growing body of evidence points towards epigenetic mechanisms being
   responsible for a wide range of biological phenomena, from the
   plasticity of plant growth and development to the nutritional control of
   caste determination in honeybees and the etiology of human disease
   (e.g., cancer). With the (partial) elucidation of the molecular basis of
   epigenetic variation and the heritability of certain of these changes,
   the field of evolutionary epigenetics is flourishing. Despite this, the
   role of epigenetics in shaping host-pathogen interactions has received
   comparatively little attention. Yet there is plenty of evidence
   supporting the implication of epigenetic mechanisms in the modulation of
   the biological interaction between hosts and pathogens. The phenotypic
   plasticity of many key parasite life-history traits appears to be under
   epigenetic control. Moreover, pathogen-induced effects in host phenotype
   may have transgenerational consequences, and the bases of these changes
   and their heritability probably have an epigenetic component. The
   significance of epigenetic modifications may, however, go beyond
   providing a mechanistic basis for host and pathogen plasticity.
   Epigenetic epidemiology has recently emerged as a promising area for
   future research on infectious diseases. In addition, the incorporation
   of epigenetic inheritance and epigenetic plasticity mechanisms to
   evolutionary models and empirical studies of host-pathogen interactions
   will provide new insights into the evolution and coevolution of these
   associations. Here, we review the evidence available for the role
   epigenetics on host-pathogen interactions, and the utility and
   versatility of the epigenetic technologies available that can be
   cross-applied to host-pathogen studies. We conclude with recommendations
   and directions for future research on the burgeoning field of
   epigenetics as applied to host-pathogen interactions.

TI Control of meiotic recombination frequency in plant genomes
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Sexual eukaryotes reproduce via the meiotic cell division, where ploidy
   is halved and homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal genetic
   exchange, termed crossover (CO). CO frequency has a profound effect on
   patterns of genetic variation and species evolution. Relative CO rates
   vary extensively both within and between plant genomes. Plant genome
   size varies by over 1000-fold, largely due to differential expansion of
   repetitive sequences, and increased genome size is associated with
   reduced CO frequency. Gene versus repeat sequences associate with
   distinct chromatin modifications, and evidence from plant genomes
   indicates that this epigenetic information influences CO patterns. This
   is consistent with data from diverse eukaryotes that demonstrate the
   importance of chromatin structure for control of meiotic recombination.
   In this review I will discuss CO frequency patterns in plant genomes and
   recent advances in understanding recombination distributions.

TI Translational Control by the DEAD Box RNA Helicase belle Regulates
   Ecdysone-Triggered Transcriptional Cascades
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Steroid hormones act, through their respective nuclear receptors, to
   regulate target gene expression. Despite their critical role in
   development, physiology, and disease, however, it is still unclear how
   these systemic cues are refined into tissue-specific responses. We
   identified a mutation in the evolutionarily conserved DEAD box RNA
   helicase belle/DDX3 that disrupts a subset of responses to the steroid
   hormone ecdysone during Drosophila melanogaster metamorphosis. We
   demonstrate that belle directly regulates translation of E74A, an ets
   transcription factor and critical component of the ecdysone-induced
   transcriptional cascade. Although E74A mRNA accumulates to abnormally
   high levels in belle mutant tissues, no E74A protein is detectable,
   resulting in misregulation of E74A-dependent ecdysone response genes.
   The accumulation of E74A mRNA in belle mutant salivary glands is a
   result of auto-regulation, fulfilling a prediction made by Ashburner
   nearly 40 years ago. In this model, Ashburner postulates that, in
   addition to regulating secondary response genes, protein products of
   primary response genes like E74A also inhibit their own ecdysone-induced
   transcription. Moreover, although ecdysone-triggered transcription of
   E74A appears to be ubiquitous during metamorphosis, belle-dependent
   translation of E74A mRNA is spatially restricted. These results
   demonstrate that translational control plays a critical, and previously
   unknown, role in refining transcriptional responses to the steroid
   hormone ecdysone.

TI Trichostatin A Improves Preimplantation Development of Bovine Cloned
   Embryos and Alters Expression of Epigenetic and Pluripotency Genes in
   Cloned Blastocysts
SO JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB We investigated the effects of exposure time and concentration of
   trichostatin A (TSA) on in vitro development and quality of bovine SCNT
   embryos. At multiple time points, the relative expression of genes
   related to pluripotency and reprogramming was analyzed in order to
   assess the quality of preimplantation embryos cultured in media with TSA
   using real-time PCR. Development into blastocysts was higher in 100 nM
   TSA than in controls (35.96 vs. 28.30%, P<0.05). Study of 100 nM TSA
   exposure time showed development into blastocysts was higher during both
   short-term and long-term exposure than in controls (36.17 and 34.04 vs.
   23.45%), but there was no significant difference between TSA groups.
   Nanog expression in blastocysts after long-term TSA exposure was similar
   to that in IVF blastocysts and greater than in controls and short-term
   exposed embryos. The Oct4 levels in the short-term exposure group were
   similar to those of IVF blastocysts, while Oct4 expression in long-term
   exposed embryos was significantly higher than in other groups.
   Measurement of DNMT1 and HDAC1 in blastocysts showed a similar
   expression profile among IVF and TSA groups regardless of treatment
   duration. In conclusion, this study suggests that TSA treatment after
   SCNT in bovine embryos can improve in vitro development of embryos by
   increasing the blastocysts formation and positive reprogramming of the
   reconstructed embryo genome caused by downregulation of DNA methylation
   and up-regulation of pluripotency.

TI Imprinting meets genomics: new insights and new challenges
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Until recently, only a handful of imprinted genes, or genes with
   parent-of-origin dependent expression patterns, were known in plants.
   Study of these genes yielded key insights into mechanisms of monoallelic
   expression and imprinted gene function. The recent application of high
   throughput sequencing to the study of imprinting has confirmed that many
   previous findings are relevant on a genome-wide scale. The catalogue of
   imprinted genes in monocots and dicots now includes a large number of
   transcription factors, chromatin related genes, and metabolic or hormone
   biosynthesis enzymes. Interpretation of allele specific expression data

TI Histone H1 Plays a Role in Heterochromatin Formation and VSG Expression
   Site Silencing in Trypanosoma brucei
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The African sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei evades the
   host immune system through antigenic variation of its variant surface
   glycoprotein (VSG) coat. Although the T. brucei genome contains similar
   to 1500 VSGs, only one VSG is expressed at a time from one of about 15
   subtelomeric VSG expression sites (ESs). For antigenic variation to
   work, not only must the vast VSG repertoire be kept silent in a genome
   that is mainly constitutively transcribed, but the frequency of VSG
   switching must be strictly controlled. Recently it has become clear that
   chromatin plays a key role in silencing inactive ESs, thereby ensuring
   monoallelic expression of VSG. We investigated the role of the linker
   histone H1 in chromatin organization and ES regulation in T. brucei. T.
   brucei histone H1 proteins have a different domain structure to H1
   proteins in higher eukaryotes. However, we show that they play a key
   role in the maintenance of higher order chromatin structure in
   bloodstream form T. brucei as visualised by electron microscopy. In
   addition, depletion of histone H1 results in chromatin becoming
   generally more accessible to endonucleases in bloodstream but not in
   insect form T. brucei. The effect on chromatin following H1 knock-down
   in bloodstream form T. brucei is particularly evident at
   transcriptionally silent ES promoters, leading to 6-8 fold derepression
   of these promoters. T. brucei histone H1 therefore appears to be
   important for the maintenance of repressed chromatin in bloodstream form
   T. brucei. In particular H1 plays a role in downregulating silent ESs,
   arguing that H1-mediated chromatin functions in antigenic variation in
   T. brucei.

TI Seed development-related expression of ARGONAUTE4_9 class of genes in
   barley: possible role in seed dormancy
SO EUPHYTICA
AB Resistance to pre-harvest sprouting is an important breeding objective
   for cereal crops like barley and wheat. Seed dormancy, which determines
   the resistance or susceptibility to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), is a
   complex trait. It is largely controlled by the antagonistic action of
   the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellic acid, but also has a
   large component of genotype x environment interaction. Recent studies
   have revealed a role for epigenetic changes through histone modification
   in controlling seed dormancy. However, the role of DNA methylation in
   seed development and dormancy is not known. In this study, we explored
   the role of ARGONAUTE4_9 class genes of the DNA methylation pathway in
   seed development and dormancy in barley. Our results show that the two
   AGO4_9 class genes in barley, i.e. AGO1002 and AGO1003, are
   preferentially expressed in ovaries at meiosis and in embryos 25 days
   after pollination (DAP). The expression of AGO1003 is two to fivefold
   higher than that of AGO1002 in these tissues, demonstrating differential
   expression of these genes. We also analysed the expression of AGO1003 in
   embryos of PHS-resistant and -susceptible varieties at 25 DAP and found
   a significant variation in the expression of this gene in seeds of
   dormant and non-dormant lines. The observed expression pattern of
   AGO1002 and AGO1003 suggests a possible role in sporogenesis and
   post-fertilization seed development. Indirectly these results imply a
   potential role of DNA methylation in seed development and seed dormancy.

TI A Method for Large-scale Identification of Protein Arginine Methylation
SO MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS
AB The lack of methods for proteome-scale detection of arginine methylation
   restricts our knowledge of its relevance in physiological and
   pathological processes. Here we show that most tryptic peptides
   containing methylated arginine(s) are highly basic and hydrophilic.
   Consequently, they could be considerably enriched from total cell
   extracts by simple protocols using either one of strong cation exchange
   chromatography, isoelectric focusing, or hydrophilic interaction liquid
   chromatography, the latter being by far the most effective of all. These
   methods, coupled with heavy methyl-stable isotope labeling by amino
   acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry, enabled in T cells the
   identification of 249 arginine methylation sites in 131 proteins,
   including 190 new sites and 93 proteins not previously known to be
   arginine methylated. By extending considerably the number of known
   arginine methylation sites, our data reveal a novel proline-rich
   consensus motif and identify for the first time arginine methylation in
   proteins involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement at the immunological
   synapse and in endosomal trafficking. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics

   (Pol IV and Pol V). Pol IV produces precursors for siRNA biogenesis
   while Pol V produces scaffold transcripts required for siRNAs and

TI Identification and Characterization of an Epi-Allele of FIE1 Reveals a
   Regulatory Linkage between Two Epigenetic Marks in Rice
SO PLANT CELL
AB DNA methylation and histone H3 Lys 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) are
   important epigenetic repression marks for silencing transposons in
   heterochromatin and for regulating gene expression. However, the
   mechanistic relationship to other repressive marks, such as histone H3
   Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is unclear. FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT
   ENDOSPERM1 (FIE1) encodes an Esc-like core component of the Polycomb
   repressive complex 2, which is involved in H3K27me3-mediated gene
   repression. Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of
   rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various
   floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion. We found that
   Epi-df has no changes in nucleotide sequence but is hypomethylated in
   the 59 region of FIE1 and has reduced H3K9me2 and increased H3K4me3. In
   Epi-df, FIE1 was ectopically expressed and its imprinting was disrupted.
   FIE1 interacted with rice Enhancer of Zeste homologs, consistent with
   its role in H3K27me3 repression. Ectopic expression of FIE1 in Epi-df
   resulted in alteration of H3K27me3 levels in hundreds of genes. In
   summary, this work identifies an epi-allele involved in
   H3K27me3-mediated gene repression that itself is highly regulated by DNA
   methylation and histone H3K9me2, thereby shedding light on the link
   between DNA methylation and histone methylation, the two important
   epigenetic marks regulating rice development.

TI Overweight, Obesity and Thyroid Cancer Risk: a Meta-analysis of Cohort
   Studies
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis examined the relationship between excess
   body weight or body mass index (BMI) and risk of thyroid cancer.
   METHODS: PubMed (R), MEDLINE (R), EMBASE (TM) and Academic Search (TM)
   Premier databases were searched to identify cohort studies examining the
   effect of being overweight or obese on the risk of thyroid cancer.
   RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met by seven cohort studies (total
   number of thyroid cancer cases, 5154). The pooled relative risk (RR) of
   thyroid cancer was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.22) for
   overweight. Obesity was also linked with increased thyroid cancer risk
   in males and females, the strength of the association increasing with
   increasing BMI. The combined RR of thyroid cancer was 1.18 (95% CI 1.11,
   1.25) for excess body weight (overweight and obesity combined). Being
   overweight was associated with a significant increase in thyroid cancer
   risk among non-Asians, but not among Asians. Overweight, obesity and
   excess body weight were all associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma
   risk. CONCLUSIONS: The association between overweight/obesity/excess
   body weight and thyroid cancer risk was confirmed.

TI Expression and significance of histone H3K27 demethylases in renal cell
   carcinoma
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: The histone H3K27 demethylases UTX and JMJD3 are important
   regulatory factors that modulate gene expression by altering the
   physical state of chromatin. Previous studies have indicated an abnormal
   H3K27 methylation status in carcinogenesis. We therefore investigated
   the expression patterns of UTX and JMJD3 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
   and their roles in cancer development.
   Methods: The mRNA expression levels of the UTX and JMJD3 genes were
   determined in cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues in 36 patients
   with primary RCC, using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain
   reaction. The UTX and JMJD3 protein contents were measured by western
   blotting and immunohistochemical analysis.
   Results: UTX and JMJD3 transcripts were significantly increased in
   cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (P<0.05). mRNA levels of the
   inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 p16INK4a were also
   increased in cancer tissues (P<0.001). Western blotting indicated that
   levels of both demethylases were increased in cancer tissues. The level
   of tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) was lower in cancer tissues compared
   to normal tissues, but expression of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2
   was increased (P<0.05). These results suggest that the two H3K27
   demethylases may play critical roles in the regulation of H3K27
   methylation status in RCC. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that
   UTX and JMJD3 expression were upregulated in cancer tissues compared to
   adjacent tissues.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that UTX and JMJD3 were upregulated
   in cancer tissues, suggesting that they may be involved in the
   development of primary RCC. The potential roles of H3K27 demethylases as
   biomarkers in the early diagnosis of RCC need to be further explored.

TI The relation between fearfulness in young and stress-response in adult
   laying hens, on individual and group level
SO PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
AB Fearfulness of an individual can affect its sensitivity to stress, while
   at the same time the social situation in which an animal lives can
   affect its fear level. It is however unknown what the long-term effects
   of high fearfulness on sensitivity to stress are, on individual or group
   level in laying hens. We hypothesize that increased fearfulness at a
   young age results in increased sensitivity to stress at an adult age,
   and that this relation can differ between groups, due to differences in
   group composition. Therefore, we studied the relation between
   fearfulness in an Open Field (OF) test at six weeks of age and
   plasma-corticosterone (CORT) levels after a 5-min Manual Restraint test
   (MR) at 33 weeks of age, and assessed behavior in the home pen. We used
   birds from a low mortality line, selected for four generations on low
   mortality due to feather pecking and cannibalism and a control line
   (n=153 in total, eight pens/line). These lines are known to differ in
   fearfulness and stress physiology. Chicks from the low mortality line
   were more active in the OF compared to chicks from the control line.
   Chicks that showed a fearful response (no walking, no vocalizing) in the
   OF test had higher CORT at 33 weeks of age than chicks that walked
   and/or vocalized in the OF test and had higher activity in the home pen
   as adults. On group level, a passive response in the OF was related to
   high CORT levels after MR. Presence of at least one fearful bird in a
   group led to higher CORT in the other group mates compared to birds from
   groups with no fearful birds present. Birds from groups in which more
   than 50% of birds had severe comb lesions had higher CORT levels
   compared to birds from groups with less than 50% of birds affected. High
   fearfulness of laying hen chicks can on individual level have a
   long-term effect on stress sensitivity. The presence of fearful birds in
   a group as well as signs of social instability in a group, indicated by
   comb lesions, can affect sensitivity to stress of birds from the same
   group. The mechanism by which this occurs can lie in social transmission
   of (fear related) behavior, but this suggestion needs further
   investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Incidental Thyroid Cancer Found during Surgery for Head and Neck
   Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB Objective. To quantify the incidence of occult thyroid cancer
   encountered during neck dissection in patients with head and neck
   squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), to discuss the management of these
   patients, and to assess the need for further treatment of the
   incidentally discovered thyroid cancer.
   Study Design. Case series with chart review.
   Setting. University-based tertiary care hospital.
   Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed 2538 neck dissections
   performed at their institution over a 15-year period. Twenty-nine
   patients had an incidental pathologic finding of thyroid cancer at
   surgery. The authors reviewed demographics, diagnoses, histopathology,
   initial and subsequent management, and outcome.
   Results. Well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDC) was found in every
   case in this cohort. Fifteen patients died during the period of the
   study (2.4-year follow-up), with 14 patients still alive (4.3-year
   follow-up). Seven patients, all of whom are still alive, received
   further treatment for their thyroid cancer: 2 with completion
   thyroidectomy, 2 with I-131 ablation, and 3 with both. There was no
   clinical evidence of recurrence of thyroid cancer in any of the patients
   who died, and none died as a result of thyroid cancer. In addition, none
   of the patients still alive have biopsy-proven evidence of thyroid
   cancer recurrence.
   Conclusion. None of the patients in this cohort died as a result of
   their thyroid disease, and none of the patients had evidence of
   recurrence of their WDC during the follow-up period. The results suggest
   that further management of occult WDC discovered in patients receiving
   neck dissections for HNSCC is not necessary.

   lines and in primary gastric cancers. Transcriptional gene silence of
   DACT1 was mainly regulated by promoter hypermethylation. Ectopic
   expression of DACT1 in silenced gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, BGC823
   and MGC803) by stable transfection suppressed colony formation (P <
   0.001), induced cell apoptosis (P < 0.01) and retarded tumorigenesis in
   nude mice (P < 0.001). The tumor suppressive effect of DACT1 was further
   confirmed by loss of DACT1 function experiment. The proapoptotic and
   antiproliferative effect by DACT1 was associated with inhibition of
   nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation and its downstream factors,
   including B-cell CLL/lymphoma-2, Bcl-X, interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha. Moreover, promoter methylation of DACT1 was detected in
   29.3% (60/205) of primary gastric tumors. DACT1 methylation was
   significantly associated with tumor metastasis (P < 0.05), invasion (P <
   0.05) and advanced tumor stage (P < 0.0005). These findings provided
   insight into the role of DACT1 as a novel functional tumor suppressor in
   gastric cancer through inhibiting NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Promoter
   methylation of DACT1 is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Online

TI Dietary calcium induced cytological and biochemical changes in thyroid
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Certain epidemiological studies revealed correlation between hard water
   consumption (with high calcium) and thyroid size of the population,
   though the possible alterations in thyroid physiology upon calcium
   exposure are still inconclusive. Adult male Wistar strain rats were
   subjected to calcium treatment at the doses of 0.5 g%, 1.0 g% and 1.5 rh
   calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) for 60 days. The parameters studied were -
   thyroid gland weight, histopathology, histomorphometry; thyroid
   peroxidase (TPO), 5'-deiodinase I (DI), sodium-potassium adenosine
   triphosphatase (Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase) activities; serum total and free
   thyroxine (tT4, fT4), total and free triiodothyronine (tT3, fT3),
   thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Enlargement of thyroid with
   hypertrophic and hyperplastic changes, retarded TPO and 5'-DI but
   enhanced Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activities, augmented serum total and free T4
   and TSH but decreased total and free T3 levels and low T3/T4 ratio
   (T3:T4) were observed in the treated groups. All these findings indicate
   development of goitrogenesis upon exposure to excessive dietary calcium.

TI Handling of Adolescent Rats Improves Learning and Memory and Decreases
   Anxiety
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB Some environmental interventions can result in physiologic and
   behavioral changes in laboratory animals. In this context, the handling
   of adolescent or adult rodents has been reported to influence
   exploratory behavior and emotionality. Here we examined the effects of
   handling on memory and anxiety levels of adolescent rats. Male
   Sprague-Dawley rats (age, 60 d) were divided into a control group and a
   handled group, which were handled for 5 min daily, 5 d per week, for 6
   wk. During handling bouts, the rat was removed from its cage, placed in
   the experimenter's lap or on the top of a table, and had its neck and
   back gently stroked by the experimenter's fingers. During week 6, each
   rat's anxiety level was evaluated in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test.
   Learning and memory were evaluated 48 h later, by measuring escape
   latency in the elevated plus-maze test. Plasma corticosterone and
   catecholamine levels were measured also. Norepinephrine levels were
   lower in the handled rats compared with control animals, with no
   differences in epinephrine and corticosterone. As compared with the
   control rats, the handled rats showed increases in the percentage of
   time spent in the open arms of the test apparatus, percentage of entries
   into open arms, and number of visits to the end of the open arms and
   decreases in the latency of the first open arm entry. Escape latency was
   lower in the handled rats compared with control rats in both the first
   and second trials. The data obtained suggest that handling decreases
   anxiety levels and improves learning skills and memory in rats.

TI Role of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor in
   fluoride-induced goitrogenesis in rats
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Endemic fluorosis is a serious problem in public health. Previous
   studies have indicated that patients with thyroid goiters usually live
   in fluoride-affected areas. However, the mechanism of goitrogenesis
   caused independently by fluoride is still unclear. The principle
   objective of this study was to investigate the possible roles of nitric
   oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the genesis
   of fluoride-induced nodular goiters. Eighty SD rats (40 males and 40
   females) at the age of 4 weeks were used to establish animal models via
   fluoride-supplemented drinking water. These rats were randomly divided
   into four groups of 20. Group 1 was used as the control and were given
   deionized water. Group 2 (LF), group 3 (MF), and group 4 (HF) were given
   deionized water containing 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 200 mg/L of sodium
   fluoride (NaF), respectively. Thyroid samples were collected on day 150.
   Pathological observation was performed to evaluate structural changes in
   the thyroid gland. The expression of VEGF mRNA in the thyroid glands was
   assessed by reverse transcriptional PCR. The serum NO level was analyzed
   by spectrometric methods. In addition, immunohistochemistry was
   conducted to evaluate expression and deposition of VEGF in the thyroid
   gland. The results showed that the average relative weight of the
   thyroid glands of rats in the fluoride-treated groups was significantly
   higher than that in control rats (p<0.05). The proliferation and
   dilatation of capillary blood vessels, enlarged follicles with excessive
   colloid, and obvious nodules were found in the thyroid glands of
   fluoride-treated rats. Compared to the control group, the expression of
   VEGF mRNA in the thyroid gland and the serum NO levels in the
   fluoride-treated groups were significantly increased (p<0.05).
   Furthermore, the deposition of VEGF in epithelial and follicular cells
   of the thyroid gland was significantly higher in fluoride-treated groups
   than in the control group. These results suggested that abnormal
   expression of VEGF induced by fluoride can lead to the proliferation of
   vascular endothelial cells in the thyroid gland. Accordingly, VEGF
   oversecreted locally by vascular endothelial cells might contribute to
   the proliferation of epithelial and follicular cells, resulting in the
   formation of hyperplastic nodules and enlargement of the thyroid gland.
   Furthermore, we proposed that there might be a positive feedback
   mechanism between NO and VEGF expression in fluoride-induced goiter
   formation. It was concluded that angiogenic and vasodilative factors
   such as VEGF and NO must be involved in fluoride-induced thyroid
   goitrogenesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Methylation capacity of arsenic and skin lesions in smelter plant
   workers
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Potential occupational arsenic exposure is a significant problem in
   smelting plants. The metabolites containing arsenic with an oxidation of
   +3 have been considered more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their parent
   inorganic species. The current study examined the capacity of arsenic
   methylation and its risk on skin lesions. The primary aim of this study
   is to determine if methylation capacity, as measured by urinary arsenic
   metabolites, differed in workers with skin lesions compared to workers
   without skin lesions. Hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry
   was used to determine three arsenic species in urine of workers who had
   been working in arsenic plants, and primary and secondary methylation
   indexes were calculated. Skin lesions were examined at the same time.
   Many workers had obvious skin lesions (36/91). The mean concentrations
   of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and
   dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in urine of workers are obviously higher than
   those of the control group. There are more iAs, MMA, and DMA in urine,
   higher MMA%, lower iAs% for workers with skin lesions compared with
   those without skin lesions. Workers with skin lesions have the lowest
   SMI (3.50 +/- 1.21), and they may be in danger. Our results support the
   viewpoint that individuals who metabolize inorganic arsenic to MMA
   easily, but metabolize MMA to DMA difficulty have more risk of skin
   lesions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Effect of Vitamin A Supplementation on Thyroid Function in
   Premenopausal Women
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NUTRITION
AB Objective: Vitamin A and its retinoid derivates play an important role
   in regulation of normal growth and development. Vitamin A has been shown
   to regulate thyroid hormone metabolism and inhibit thyroid-stimulating
   hormone (TSH) secretion via down regulation of TSH-beta gene expression;
   however, the effect of vitamin A on thyroid function in obese
   individuals who are at higher risk of subclinical hypothyroidism is
   still unclear. In the present study we investigate the impact of vitamin
   A supplementation on thyroid function in obese women.
   Method: A 4-month randomized, double blind controlled trial was
   conducted among 84 healthy women aged 17-50 years old: 56 were obese
   (body mass index [BMI] 30-35 kg/m(2)) and 28 were nonobese (BMI
   18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). Obese women were randomly allocated to receive
   either vitamin A (25,000 IU/d retinyl palmitate) or placebo. Nonobese
   women received vitamin A. At baseline and 4 months after intervention,
   serum concentrations of TSH, total thyroxine (T4), total
   triiodothyronine (T3), retinol-binding protein (RBP), and transthyretin
   (TTR) were measured.
   Results: Baseline concentrations of thyroid hormones, RBP and TTR were
   not significantly different between groups. Vitamin A caused a
   significant reduction in serum TSH concentrations in obese (p = 0.004)
   and nonobese (p = 0.001) groups. Serum T3 concentrations also increased
   in both obese and nonobese vitamin A-treated groups (p < 0.001). Serum
   T4 decreased in all 3 groups after treatment. The results showed a
   significant reduction in serum RBP in the obese group after vitamin A
   supplementation (p = 0.007), but no significant change was seen in serum
   TTR.
   Conclusions: Serum TSH concentrations in vitamin A treated subjects were
   significantly reduced; therefore, vitamin A supplementation might reduce
   the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism in premenopausal women.

TI Mechanisms and inhibition of uracil methylating enzymes

TI The Impact of Transportation on Physiological and Behavioral Parameters
   in Wistar Rats: Implications for Acclimatization Periods
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Transportation of laboratory rodents unavoidably causes stress.
   Nevertheless, very little is known about the effects of transportation
   and how long it takes for the animal to recuperate. In the present
   study, we investigated physiological and behavioral parameters before
   and after transportation in both transported and nontransported animals.
   We took blood samples to analyze plasma corticosterone and creatine
   kinase, and performed physiological measurements by means of telemetry,
   measuring heart rate, blood pressure, and activity. Behavior was
   measured by means of home cage observations. This study revealed that
   plasma corticosterone levels increased at least up to 16 days after
   transportation, blood pressure and heart rate showed a lasting decrease
   after transportation, grooming increased, and social interactions and
   locomotor activity decreased after transportation. With these data we
   demonstrate that there is a long-lasting effect of transportation on
   physiological and behavioral parameters. Our results show that the
   stressful impact of transportation embraces all parts of the procedure,
   including for example the packing of the animals. Researchers must be
   aware of this impact and provide a sufficient acclimatization period to
   allow for the (re-)stabilization of parameters. Insufficient
   acclimatization periods endanger not only the reliability of research
   results but also the welfare of the animal used.

TI Gel-free multiplexed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing for

SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Sequencing-based approaches have led to new insights about DNA
   methylation. While many different techniques for genome-scale mapping of
   DNA methylation have been employed, throughput has been a key limitation
   for most. To further facilitate the mapping of DNA methylation, we
   describe a protocol for gel-free multiplexed reduced representation
   bisulfite sequencing (mRRBS) that reduces the workload dramatically and
   enables processing of 96 or more samples per week. mRRBS achieves
   similar CpG coverage to the original RRBS protocol, while the higher
   throughput and lower cost make it better suited for large-scale DNA
   methylation mapping studies, including cohorts of cancer samples.

TI Cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation mark DNA for elimination in
   Oxytricha trifallax
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Cytosine methylation of DNA is conserved across eukaryotes
   and plays important functional roles regulating gene expression during
   differentiation and development in animals, plants and fungi.
   Hydroxymethylation was recently identified as another epigenetic
   modification marking genes important for pluripotency in embryonic stem
   cells.
   Results: Here we describe de novo cytosine methylation and
   hydroxymethylation in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax. These DNA
   modifications occur only during nuclear development and programmed
   genome rearrangement. We detect methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine
   directly by high-resolution nano-flow UPLC mass spectrometry, and
   indirectly by immunofluorescence, methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation and
   bisulfite sequencing. We describe these modifications in three classes
   of eliminated DNA: germline-limited transposons and satellite repeats,
   aberrant DNA rearrangements, and DNA from the parental genome undergoing
   degradation. Methylation and hydroxymethylation generally occur on the
   same sequence elements, modifying cytosines in all sequence contexts. We
   show that the DNA methyltransferase-inhibiting drugs azacitidine and
   decitabine induce demethylation of both somatic and germline sequence
   elements during genome rearrangements, with consequent elevated levels
   of germline-limited repetitive elements in exconjugant cells.
   Conclusions: These data strongly support a functional link between
   cytosine DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and DNA elimination. We
   identify a motif strongly enriched in methylated/hydroxymethylated
   regions, and we propose that this motif recruits DNA modification
   machinery to specific chromosomes in the parental macronucleus. No
   recognizable methyltransferase enzyme has yet been described in O.
   trifallax, raising the possibility that it might employ a novel cytosine
   methylation machinery to mark DNA sequences for elimination during
   genome rearrangements.

TI Relationships between chromatin remodeling and DNA damage repair induced
   by 8-methoxypsoralen and UVA in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Eukaryotic cells have developed mechanisms to prevent genomic
   instability, such as DNA damage detection and repair, control of cell
   cycle progression and cell death induction. The bifunctional compound
   furocumarin 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is widely used in the treatment of
   various inflammatory skin diseases. In this review, we summarize recent
   data about the role of chromatin remodeling in the repair of DNA damage
   induced by treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen plus UVA (8-MOP+UVA),
   focusing on repair proteins in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   an established model system for studying DNA repair pathways. The
   interstrand crosslinks (ICL) formed by the 8-MOP+UVA treatment are
   detrimental lesions that can block transcription and replication,
   leading to cell death if not repaired. Current data show the involvement
   of different pathways in ICL processing, such as nucleotide excision
   repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), translesion repair (TLS) and
   double-strand break repair. 8-MOP+UVA treatment in yeast enhances the
   expression of genes involved in the DNA damage response, double strand
   break repair by homologous replication, as well as genes related to cell
   cycle regulation. Moreover, alterations in the expression of
   subtelomeric genes and genes related to chromatin remodeling are
   consistent with structural modifications of chromatin relevant to DNA
   repair. Taken together, these findings indicate a specific profile in
   8-MOP+UVA responses related to chromatin remodeling and DNA repair.

TI Primary surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer in the new millennium
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) are malignancies of follicular cell
   derivation. Histopathologically and oncologically, DTC fall into two
   broad tumor categories: papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer
   (FTC). These major tumor categories, based on clinical manifestation and
   biological behavior, are further subdivided into low-risk [papillary
   micro-carcinoma (mPTC); minimally invasive follicular cancer (MIFTC)]
   and high-risk DTC [PTC>1 cm or metastatic; MIFTC with histopathological
   angioinvasion; widely invasive FTC (WIFTC)]. Recently, a surgical
   approach has been adopted that differentiates between low-risk and
   high-risk DTC. The rationale behind this new concept is to better
   balance oncologic risk (high vs low) with the surgical morbidity
   attendant to the procedure (recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and
   hypoparathyroidism). This surgical risk is larger with routine total
   thyroidectomy (TT) and central node dissection (CND) than with less than
   TT or TT without CND. Whereas TT with CND remains the treatment of
   choice for high-risk DTC with metastases, the extent of thyroid
   resection and lymph node dissection can be reduced in low-risk PTC and
   FTC without demonstrable loss of oncological benefit. In the new
   millennium, the surgical approach to DTC, especially low-risk PTC and
   FTC, has undergone considerable change, resulting in less extensive
   procedures. This risk-adapted strategy relies not only on the skillful
   histopathologic detection of multifocality in PTC and vascular invasion
   in MIFTC, but likewise necessitates diligent follow-up to spot and
   adequately treat local recurrences and distant metastases as they become
   clinically apparent. [J. Endocrinol. Invest. 35 (Suppl. to no. 6):

TI Thyroid Lipomatosis
SO INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB Thyroid lipomatosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of
   abundant mature adipose tissue in the thyroid gland. We herein report
   the case of a 43-year-old man with chronic renal failure caused by
   amyloidosis presenting with an asymmetrically enlarging thyroid gland.
   The patient's thyroid hormone levels were normal, and test results for
   thyroid autoantibodies were negative. A thyroid scan showed diffuse
   uptake of the radioisotope with a cold area in the left lobe. The
   pathology of the thyroidectomy material indicated thyroid lipomatosis,
   and minimal amyloid staining was noted around the thyroid follicles.
   Thyroid lipomatosis should therefore be kept in mind when making a
   differential diagnosis of fatty infiltration of amyloid goiter.

TI The landscape of DNA repeat elements in human heart failure
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: The epigenomes of healthy and diseased human hearts were
   recently examined by genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Repetitive
   elements, heavily methylated in post-natal tissue, have variable
   methylation profiles in cancer but methylation of repetitive elements in
   the heart has never been examined.
   Results: We analyzed repetitive elements from all repeat families in
   human myocardial samples, and found that satellite repeat elements were
   significantly hypomethylated in end-stage cardiomyopathic hearts
   relative to healthy normal controls. Satellite repeat elements are
   almost always centromeric or juxtacentromeric, and their overexpression
   correlates with disease aggressiveness in cancer. Similarly, we found
   that hypomethylation of satellite repeat elements correlated with up to
   27-fold upregulation of the corresponding transcripts in end-stage
   cardiomyopathic hearts. No other repeat family exhibited differential
   methylation between healthy and cardiomyopathic hearts, with the
   exception of the Alu element SINE1/7SL, for which a modestly consistent
   trend of increased methylation was observed.
   Conclusions: Satellite repeat element transcripts, a form of non-coding
   RNA, have putative functions in maintaining genomic stability and
   chromosomal integrity. Further studies will be needed to establish the
   functional significance of these non-coding RNAs in the context of heart
   failure.

TI Aging effects on DNA methylation modules in human brain and blood tissue
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Several recent studies reported aging effects on DNA
   methylation levels of individual CpG dinucleotides. But it is not yet
   known whether aging-related consensus modules, in the form of clusters
   of correlated CpG markers, can be found that are present in multiple
   human tissues. Such a module could facilitate the understanding of aging
   effects on multiple tissues.
   Results: We therefore employed weighted correlation network analysis of
   2,442 Illumina DNA methylation arrays from brain and blood tissues,
   which enabled the identification of an age-related co-methylation
   module. Module preservation analysis confirmed that this module can also
   be found in diverse independent data sets. Biological evaluation showed
   that module membership is associated with Polycomb group target
   occupancy counts, CpG island status and autosomal chromosome location.
   Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the aging-related consensus
   module comprises genes that are involved in nervous system development,
   neuron differentiation and neurogenesis, and that it contains promoter
   CpGs of genes known to be down-regulated in early Alzheimer's disease. A
   comparison with a standard, non-module based meta-analysis revealed that
   selecting CpGs based on module membership leads to significantly
   increased gene ontology enrichment, thus demonstrating that studying
   aging effects via consensus network analysis enhances the biological
   insights gained.
   Conclusions: Overall, our analysis revealed a robustly defined
   age-related co-methylation module that is present in multiple human
   tissues, including blood and brain. We conclude that blood is a
   promising surrogate for brain tissue when studying the effects of age on
   DNA methylation profiles.

TI Sexually Selected Traits: A Fundamental Framework for Studies on
   Behavioral Epigenetics
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic-based mechanisms contribute
   to various aspects of sex differences in brain and behavior. The major
   obstacle in establishing and fully understanding this linkage is
   identifying the traits that are most susceptible to epigenetic
   modification. We have proposed that sexual selection provides a
   conceptual framework for identifying such traits. These are traits
   involved in intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual choice of
   mating partners and generally entail a combination of male-male
   competition and female choice. These behaviors are programmed during
   early embryonic and postnatal development, particularly during the
   transition from the juvenile to adult periods, by exposure of the brain
   to steroid hormones, including estradiol and testosterone. We evaluate
   the evidence that endocrine-disrupting compounds, including bisphenol A,
   can interfere with the vital epigenetic and gene expression pathways and
   with the elaboration of sexually selected traits with epigenetic
   mechanisms presumably governing the expression of these traits. Finally,
   we review the evidence to suggest that these steroid hormones can induce
   a variety of epigenetic changes in the brain, including the extent of
   DNA methylation, histone protein alterations, and even alterations of
   noncoding RNA, and that many of the changes differ between males and
   females. Although much previous attention has focused on primary sex
   differences in reproductive behaviors, such as male mounting and female
   lordosis, we outline why secondary sex differences related to
   competition and mate choice might also trace their origins back to
   steroid-induced epigenetic programming in disparate regions of the
   brain.

TI Recruitment and Biological Consequences of Histone Modification of
   H3K27me3 and H3K9me3
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Two histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, are well known for their
   repressive roles in the genic and nongenic regions of metazoan genomes.
   Several protein complexes are known to be responsible for generating
   these marks, including polycomb repression complex 2 and several H3K9
   methylases. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of these
   histone-modifying complexes within mammalian genomes may be mediated
   through several DNA-binding proteins, including AEBP2, JARID2, and YY1.
   In this review, we discuss the potential targeting mechanisms in light
   of the recent results that have been derived from genome-wide chromatin
   immunoprecipitation sequencing data and the in vivo functions of these
   two histone marks in light of the results derived from mouse and human
   genetic studies.

TI Transcriptional Activation of Mouse Major Satellite Regions during
   Neuronal Differentiation
SO CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Recent studies have revealed various biological functions for repetitive
   sequences, which make up about half of the human genome. One such
   sequence, major satellites, which are tandem repetitive sequences
   adjacent to the centromere, have been shown to be a kinetochore
   component that plays a role in the formation and function of the
   pericentric heterochromatin necessary for mitosis. However, it is
   unknown whether these regions also play a role in post-mitotic cells.
   Here, we show that, during neuronal differentiation, the heterochromatin
   domains that include major satellite regions become both enriched with
   the active histone modification lysine-4 trimethylation of histone H3,
   and more sensitive to nuclease, both of which suggest increased
   activation of this area. Further supporting this notion, we also found
   that transcription from major satellite regions is significantly
   increased during neuronal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.
   These results together suggest that the structural and transcriptional
   state of major satellite regions changes dramatically during neuronal
   differentiation, implying that this region might play a role in
   differentiating neurons.

TI Promoter hypermethylation in male breast cancer: analysis by multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification
SO BREAST CANCER RESEARCH
AB Introduction: Epigenetic events are, along with genetic alteration,
   important in the development and progression of cancer. Promoter
   hypermethylation causes gene silencing and is thought to be an early
   event in carcinogenesis. The role of promoter hypermethylation in male
   breast cancer has not yet been studied.
   Methods: In a group of 108 male breast cancers, the methylation status
   of 25 genes was studied using methylation-specific multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification. Methylation of more than 15% was
   regarded indicative for promoter hypermethylation. Methylation status
   was correlated with clinicopathological features, with patients' outcome
   and with 28 female breast cancer cases.
   Results: Promoter hypermethylation of the genes MSH6, WT1, PAX5, CDH13,
   GATA5 and PAX6 was seen in more than 50% of the cases, but was uncommon
   or absent in normal male breast tissue. High overall methylation status
   was correlated with high grade (P = 0.003) and was an independent
   predictor of poor survival (P = 0.048; hazard ratio 2.5). ESR1 and GSTP1
   hypermethylation were associated with high mitotic count (P = 0.037 and
   P = 0.002, respectively) and high grade (both P = 0.001). No correlation
   with survival was seen for individual genes. Compared with female breast
   cancers (logistic regression), promoter hypermethylation was less common
   in a variety of genes, particularly ESR1 (P = 0.005), BRCA1 (P = 0.010)
   and BRCA2 (P < 0.001). The most frequently hypermethylated genes (MSH6,
   CDH13, PAX5, PAX6 and WT1) were similar for male and female breast
   cancer.
   Conclusion: Promoter hypermethylation is common in male breast cancer
   and high methylation status correlates with aggressive phenotype and
   poor survival. ESR1 and GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation seem to be
   involved in development and/or progression of high-grade male breast
   cancer. Although female and male breast cancer share a set of commonly
   methylated genes, many of the studied genes are less frequently
   methylated in male breast cancer, pointing towards possible differences
   between male and female breast carcinogenesis.

TI Reduction of Miscarriages through Universal Screening and Treatment of
   Thyroid Autoimmune Diseases
SO GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION
AB Background/Aims: Universal screening for thyroid diseases during
   pregnancy is controversial. Targeted screening does not identify all
   women with thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, antithyroid peroxidase
   antibodies (TPOAb) are suspected to be associated with an increased risk
   of fetal loss, premature delivery and hypothyroidism. The aim of our
   study was to assess the rationale behind universal screening and propose
   thyroxine treatment in particular cases. Methods: Between January 2008
   and May 2009, 537 consecutive iodine-supplemented women with a singleton
   pregnancy [441 TPOAb-controls and 96 TPOAb+ women (47 nontreated and 49
   treated)] were evaluated using thyroid and obstetric parameters.
   According to our algorithm for thyroid screening in pregnancy, if
   thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) exceeded 1 mU/l in TPOAb+ women, 50 mu
   g of levothyroxine (L-T4) was prescribed. Results: The miscarriage rate
   was significantly higher in the nontreated TPOAb+ group compared with
   the treated group (16 vs. 0%; p = 0.02). Compared to the control group,
   TSH in TPOAb+ patients was higher at the first prenatal visit prior to
   L-T4 treatment (p ! 0.01), while free thyroxine was higher than in the
   control group after the 20th week (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our study
   supports the potential benefit of universal screening and L-T4 treatment
   for autoimmune thyroid disease during pregnancy. Efforts are still
   needed to further decrease miscarriage rates. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

TI Bis-SNP: Combined DNA methylation and SNP calling for Bisulfite-seq data
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by high-throughput sequencing
   (Bisulfite-seq) is an important method for studying DNA methylation and
   epigenetic gene regulation, yet current software tools do not adequately
   address single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Identifying SNPs is
   important for accurate quantification of methylation levels and for
   identification of allele-specific epigenetic events such as imprinting.
   We have developed a model-based bisulfite SNP caller, Bis-SNP, that
   results in substantially better SNP calls than existing methods, thereby
   improving methylation estimates. At an average 30x genomic coverage,
   Bis-SNP correctly identified 96% of SNPs using the default
   high-stringency settings. The open-source package is available at

TI Large-scale chromatin morpho-functional changes during mammalian oocyte
   growth and differentiation
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY
AB Mammalian oocyte development is characterized by impressive changes in
   chromatin structure and function within the germinal vesicle (GV). These
   changes are crucial to confer the oocyte with meiotic and developmental
   competencies. In cow, oocytes collected from early and middle antral
   follicles present four patterns of chromatin configuration, from GV0 to
   GV3, and its progressive condensation has been related to the
   achievement of developmental potential. During oogenesis, follicular
   cells are essential for the acquisition of meiotic and developmental
   competencies and communicate with the oocyte by paracrine and gap
   junction mediated mechanisms. We recently analyzed the role of gap
   junction communications (GJC) on chromatin remodeling process during the
   specific phase of folliculogenesis that coincides with the
   transcriptional silencing and sequential acquisition of meiotic and
   developmental capabilities. Our studies demonstrated that GJC between
   germinal and somatic compartments plays a fundamental role in the
   regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcription activities during
   the final oocyte differentiation, throughout cAMP dependent
   mechanism(s).

TI PAX8-PPAR gamma Oncogene in Follicular Thyroid Tumors: RT-PCR and
   Immunohistochemical Analyses
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology is currently the best
   diagnostic tool for thyroid nodules. However, it is not sensitive and
   specific enough for differentiating between benign and malignant
   follicular tumors. A potentially useful marker for this differentiation
   is the PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement, identified in follicular thyroid
   carcinomas, but not in follicular adenomas or other types of thyroid
   tumors. The aim of this research was to determine the clinical
   significance of the PAX8-PPAR gamma oncogene in diagnostics follicular
   thyroid tumors. The study included 62 patients with follicular or
   Hurthle cell tumors. Gene expression was determined by reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from paraffin embedded
   tissues, and PCR products were checked using the agarose gel
   electrophoresis. The immunohistochemical analysis was performed on
   archive paraffin embedded tissues with the monoclonal PPAR gamma
   antibody. The statistical analysis has indicated that neither the
   expression of PAX8-PPAR gamma mRNA, nor the immunohystochemical analysis
   with the PPAR gamma antibody correlate with the patohystological
   diagnosis. The oncogene PAX8-PPAR gamma has not met the expectations as
   a reliable tumor marker for differentiation between benign and malignant
   thyroid tumors, which makes the only reliable histological criteria -
   capsular and vascular invasion.

TI Gene-Environment Interactions and Epigenetic Pathways in Autism: The
   Importance of One-Carbon Metabolism
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Both genetic and epigenetic factors play important roles in the rate and
   severity of classic autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This
   review focuses on DNA methylation as a key epigenetic mechanism in
   autism. The critical role that one-carbon (C(1)) metabolism plays in
   establishing and maintaining DNA methylation patterns makes it a likely
   candidate pathway to regulate epigenetic processes in ASDs. This review
   is the first, to our knowledge, to examine how altering C(1) metabolic
   function through genetic and environmental factors (focusing on diet)
   may lead to aberrant DNA methylation and increase susceptibility to
   ASDs. Additionally, the critical time windows for sensitivity to genetic
   and dietary factors both during the development of cortical networks
   implicated in ASDs and in regard to potential treatments are discussed.
   One thing is clear, if C(1) metabolism plays a critical role in ASDs, it
   provides a potential avenue for treatment and perhaps, ultimately,
   prevention.

   showed a medullary thyroid carcinoma with a cervical lymph nodes
   metastasis so the patient underwent total thyroidectomy with selective

AB Standardization of methods for obtaining iPS cells from the human
   somatic cells and then their successful differentiation are important in
   the context of their possible application in personalized cell therapy
   and the development of toxicological and pharmacological tests. In the
   present study, the influence of the small molecules representing
   epigenetic modulators (histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A and
   DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG-108) on the process of reverting
   neural progenitors from HUCB-NSC (Human Umbilical Cord Blood Neural Stem
   Cell) line to the pluripotent state was tested. The experiments were
   conducted in low oxygen tension, in three different experimental
   layouts: (1) in the presence of reprogramming/recombinant polyarginine
   tailed proteins; (2) with recombinant proteins and small molecules; (3)
   only in the presence of small molecules. We wanted to find out, whether
   it will be possible to induce pluripotent state of neural stem cells
   only by epigenetic modulators. Our results revealed that the inhibitors
   of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation used along with 5% oxygen
   tension can only transiently induce or elevate some pluripotency genes
   in neural progenitors with different pattern, but were not sufficient
   for stable reprogramming. The iPS cells from neural progenitor cells of
   HUCB-NSC were obtained only when TSA, RG-108 and reprogramming proteins
   have been applied simultaneously. These cells were tested for the
   expression of the selected pluripotency genes and in functional assays
   to prove their pluripotency stage. The obtained data show that the small
   molecules in conjunction with reprogramming factors are the potent tools
   in cell reprogramming.

TI Chromatin accessibility reveals insights into androgen receptor
   activation and transcriptional specificity
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin accessibility impact
   transcription factor binding to DNA and transcriptional specificity. The
   androgen receptor (AR), a master regulator of the male phenotype and
   prostate cancer pathogenesis, acts primarily through ligand-activated
   transcription of target genes. Although several determinants of AR
   transcriptional specificity have been elucidated, our understanding of
   the interplay between chromatin accessibility and AR function remains
   incomplete.
   Results: We used deep sequencing to assess chromatin structure via DNase
   I hypersensitivity and mRNA abundance, and paired these datasets with
   three independent AR ChIP-seq datasets. Our analysis revealed
   qualitative and quantitative differences in chromatin accessibility that
   corresponded to both AR binding and an enrichment of motifs for
   potential collaborating factors, one of which was identified as SP1.
   These quantitative differences were significantly associated with
   AR-regulated mRNA transcription across the genome. Base-pair resolution
   of the DNase I cleavage profile revealed three distinct footprinting
   patterns associated with the AR-DNA interaction, suggesting multiple
   modes of AR interaction with the genome.
   Conclusions: In contrast with other DNA-binding factors, AR binding to
   the genome does not only target regions that are accessible to DNase I
   cleavage prior to hormone induction. AR binding is invariably associated
   with an increase in chromatin accessibility and, consequently, changes
   in gene expression. Furthermore, we present the first in vivo evidence
   that a significant fraction of AR binds only to half of the full AR DNA
   motif. These findings indicate a dynamic quantitative relationship
   between chromatin structure and AR-DNA binding that impacts AR
   transcriptional specificity.

TI Diffuse Sclerosing Variant of Thyroid Carcinoma Presenting as Hashimoto
   Thyroiditis: A Case Report
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB The aim of report is to present a case of a rare diffuse sclerosing
   variant of a papillary thyroid carcinoma. A 15-year old girl referred
   for ultrasound examination because of painless thyroid swelling lasting
   10 days before. An ultrasound of the neck showed diffusely changed
   thyroid parenchyma, without nodes, looking as lymphocytic thyroiditis
   Hashimoto at first, but with "snow-storm" appearance, predominantly in
   the right lobe. Positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-AT) also
   suggested Hashimoto thyroiditis. Repeated US-FNAB (fine
   needle-aspiration biopsy) of the right lobe revealed diffuse sclerosing
   variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and patient underwent total
   thyreoidectomy. Patohistologic finding confirmed diffuse sclerosing
   variant of a papillary thyroid carcinoma in the both thyroid lobes and
   several metastatic lymph nodes. Two months later patient recived
   radioablative therapy with 3700 MBq (100 mCi) of I-131 followed by
   levothyroxine replacement. At the moment, patient is without evidence of
   local or distant metastases and next regular control is scheduled in 6
   months. In conclusion, a diffuse sclerosing variant is rare form of
   papillary thyroid carcinoma that echographically looks similar to
   Hashimoto thyroiditis and sometimes could be easily overlooked.

TI Synaptic Plasticity, But Not Hippocampal Neurogenesis, Mediated the
   Counteractive Effect of Wolfberry on Depression in Rats
SO CELL TRANSPLANTATION
AB Depression is a life-threatening psychiatric disorder characterized with
   a long-term hypercortisolemia in depressed patients. Based on this
   clinical feature, hypercortisolemia was mimicked in experimental animals
   to understand the neuropathogy of depression and to explore new
   therapeutic strategies. Wolfberry, also known as Lycium barbarum, is a
   type of common fruit produced in mainland China. Accumulated evidence
   has shown that the extracts from Lycium barbarum (LBP) had a wide range
   of neuroprotective effects in various neurogenerative models. However,
   the antidepressant effect of LBP on depression and its mechanism has not
   yet been explored. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   LBP on counteracting depression using an animal model injected with
   moderate dose (40 mg/kg) or severe dose (50 mg/kg) of corticosterone
   (CURT) treatments for 14 days. The results showed that CURT
   significantly increased immobility time and decreased hippocampal cell
   proliferation. LBP treatment significantly decreased the immobility time
   in forced swimming test, a test for the intensity of depressive
   behaviors, both in 40 and 50 mg/kg CURT stressed rats. Moreover, LBP
   treatment restored the reduced proliferation of neuroprogentior cells in
   the hippocampus in 40 mg/kg CURT stressed rats and the neuronal
   differentiation but not the proliferation in 50 mg/kg CURT stressed
   rats. After ablation of adult neurogenesis with Ara-c infusion, the
   beneficial effect of LBP treatment in reducing immobility time was not
   affected in 40 and 50 mg/kg CURT stressed rats. Golgi staining and
   Western blotting detection showed that LBP treatment restored the
   reduced spine density and the decreased level of PSD-95 in the
   hippocampus caused by 40 and 50 mg/kg CURT, respectively, indicating
   enhanced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The data showed a novel
   effect of LBP on reducing depression-like behavior and its
   antidepressant effect may be mediated by enhanced synaptic plasticity,
   but not hippocampal neurogenesis.

TI Folate deficiency enhances the inflammatory response of macrophages
SO MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
AB B-vitamin deficiency is a risk factor for vascular disease. The
   mechanism by which the deficiency impacts on disease risk is unclear. We
   have analysed whether the inflammatory response of mononuclear cells can
   be modified by cellular folate status in vitro.
   We show that the mouse monocyte cell line RAW264.7 grown under folate
   restriction displays a decrease in intracellular folate levels and a
   reduced growth rate. The cells also show a 2- to 3-fold increase in
   expression of the inflammatory mediators, IL1 beta, IL6, TNF alpha and
   MCP1 at the RNA and protein level (p < 0.01) under conditions of folate
   deficiency. In contrast the production of the vaso-protective mediator
   nitric oxide is significantly reduced under these conditions. These
   metabolic changes are independent of the concentration of homocysteine
   in the medium and occur in the absence of significant changes in global
   DNA methylation. Folate deficiency may therefore exacerbate
   cardiovascular disease by augmenting pro-inflammatory signals in the
   monocyte-macrophage lineage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Biomechanics and hydrodynamics of prey capture in the Chinese giant
   salamander reveal a high-performance jaw-powered suction feeding
   mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB During the evolutionary transition from fish to tetrapods, a shift from
   uni- to bidirectional suction feeding systems followed a reduction in
   the gill apparatus. Such a shift can still be observed during
   metamorphosis of salamanders, although many adult salamanders retain
   their aquatic lifestyle and feed by high-performance suction.
   Unfortunately, little is known about the interplay between jaws and
   hyobranchial motions to generate bidirectional suction flows. Here, we
   study the cranial morphology, as well as kinematic and hydrodynamic
   aspects related to prey capture in the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias
   davidianus). Compared with fish and previously studied amphibians, A.
   davidianus uses an alternative suction mechanism that mainly relies on
   accelerating water by separating the 'plates' formed by the long and
   broad upper and lower jaw surfaces. Computational fluid dynamics
   simulations, based on three-dimensional morphology and kinematical data
   from high-speed videos, indicate that the viscerocranial elements mainly
   serve to accommodate the water that was given a sufficient
   anterior-to-posterior impulse beforehand by powerful jaw separation. We
   hypothesize that this modified way of generating suction is primitive
   for salamanders, and that this behaviour could have played an important
   role in the evolution of terrestrial life in vertebrates by releasing
   mechanical constraints on the hyobranchial system.

TI Deregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions in an
   Alzheimer's disease rat model
SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB Elevated cortisol evidence in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients prompted
   the hypothesis that stress and glucocorticoids are involved in the
   development and/or maintenance of AD. We investigated the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, functionality, and
   reactivity for up to 6 weeks after an intracerebroventricular injection
   of amyloid-beta(25-35) peptide (A beta(25-35)) in rat, a validated acute
   model of AD. A beta(25-35) induces memory impairment, alteration of
   anxiety responses, HPA axis hyperactivity, and glucocorticoid (GR) and
   mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor increases in brain regions related to
   HPA axis functions. GR are progressively translocated in neurons
   nucleus, while membrane version of MR is evidenced in all structures
   considered. The MR/GR ratio was modified in all structures considered. A
   beta(25-35) induces a subtle disturbance in the feedback of the HPA
   axis, without modifying its functionality. The reactivity alteration is
   long-lasting, suggesting that amyloid toxicity affects the HPA axis
   adaptive response to stress. These findings are evidence of progressive
   HPAaxis deregulation afterA beta(25-35), which is associated with an
   imbalance of MR/GR ratio and a disruption of the glucocorticoid
   receptors nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and suggest that elevated
   glucocorticoids observed in AD could be first a consequence of amyloid
   toxicity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Mercury bioaccumulation along food webs in temperate aquatic ecosystems
   colonized by aquatic macrophytes in south western France
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Mercury (Hg) is considered as an important pollutant for aquatic systems
   as its organic form, methylmercury (MeHg), is easily bioaccumulated and
   bioamplified along food webs. In various ecosystems, aquatic periphyton
   associated with macrophyte was identified as an important place for Hg
   storage and methylation by microorganisms. Our study concerns temperate
   aquatic ecosystems (South Western France) colonized by invasive
   macrophytes and characterized by high mercury methylation potentials.
   This work establishes original data concerning Hg bioaccumulation in
   organisms (plants, crustaceans, molluscs and fish) from five contrasting
   ecosystems. For low trophic level species, total Hg (THg) concentrations
   were low (from 27 +/- 2 ng THg g(-1) dw in asiatic clam Corbicula
   fluminea to 418 +/- 114 ng THg g(-1) dw in crayfish Procambarus
   clarkii). THg concentrations in some carnivorous fish (high trophic
   level) were close to or exceeded the International Marketing Level (IML)
   with values ranging from 1049 +/- 220 ng THg g(-1) dw in pike perch
   muscle (Sander lucioperca) to 3910 1307 ng THg g(-1) dw in eel muscle
   (Anguilla Anguilla). Trophic levels for the individuals were also
   evaluated through stable isotope analysis, and linked to Hg
   concentrations of organisms. A significant Hg biomagnification (r(2) =
   0.9) was observed in the Aureilhan lake, despite the absence of top
   predator fish. For this site, Ludwigia sp. periphyton, as an entry point
   of Hg into food webs, is a serious hypothesis which remains to be
   confirmed. This study provides a first investigation of Hg transfer in
   the ecosystems of south western France and allows the assessment of the
   risk associated with the presence of Hg in aquatic food webs. (C) 2013

TI Pregnane glycosides interfere with steroidogenic enzymes to
   down-regulate corticosteroid production in human adrenocortical H295R
   cells
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB A group of bioactive steroidal glycosides (pregnanes) with anorectic
   activity in animals was isolated from several genera of milkweeds
   including Hoodia and Asclepias. In this study, we investigated the
   effects, structure-activity relationships, and mechanism of action of
   pregnane glycosides on steroidogenesis in human adrenocortical H295R
   cells. Administration of pregnane glycosides for 24?h suppressed the
   basal and forskolin-stimulated release of androstenedione,
   corticosterone, and cortisone from H295R cells. The conversion of
   progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to
   either androstenedione or 11-deoxycortisol was most strongly affected,
   with 12-cinnamoyl-, benzoyl-, and tigloyl-containing pregnanes showing
   the highest activity. Incubation of pregnane glycosides for 24?h had no
   effect on mRNA transcripts of CYP11A1, CYP21A1, CYP11B1 cytochrome
   enzymes and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StaR) protein, yet
   resulted in twofold decrease in HSD3B1 mRNA levels. At the same time,
   pregnane glycosides had no effect on the CYP1, 2, or 3 drug and steroid
   metabolism enzymes and showed weak Na+/K+ ATPase and glucocorticoid
   receptor binding. Taken together, these data suggest that pregnane
   glycosides specifically suppress steroidogenesis through strong
   inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylase and steroid 17-alpha-monooxygenase,
   and weak inhibition of cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme and 21
   beta-hydroxylase, but not 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.

TI Recurrent inactivating mutations of ARID2 in non-small cell lung
   carcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin and this compact
   storage in the nucleus promotes transcriptional repression of genes.
   Chromatin remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF complex are involved
   in making DNA accessible to transcription factors and thereby are
   implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations and altered
   expression of chromatin remodeling complex genes have been described in
   cancer cells. Indeed, non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have been
   shown to harbor mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a member of the SWI/SNF
   complex, but evidence has been less clear in primary tumors. Recently,
   inactivating mutations in AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) were
   found in liver cancer related to HCV infection and in melanoma. Here, we
   explored, using a genome-wide strategy and subsequent sequencing of
   targeted genes, whether chromatin remodeling is implicated in primary
   lung adenocarcinoma. Two genes were individualized from the genome
   screening as homozygously deleted in a set of samples: JARID2 and ARID2.
   Subsequent analysis of the entire coding sequences showed that ARID2
   loss-of-function mutations were found in 5% of nonsmall cell lung
   cancers, thereby constituting one of the most frequently mutated genes
   in this cancer type after TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and STK11.

TI Carbonyl reduction of triadimefon by human and rodent 11
   beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB 11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11 beta-HSD1) catalyzes the
   conversion of inactive 11-oxo glucocorticoids (endogenous cortisone,
   11-dehydrocorticosterone and synthetic prednisone) to their potent 11
   beta-hydroxyl forms (cortisol, corticosterone and prednisolone).
   Besides, 11 beta-HSD1 accepts several other substrates. Using rodent
   liver microsomes and the unspecific inhibitor glycyrrhetinic acid, it
   has been proposed earlier that 11 beta-HSD1 catalyzes the reversible
   conversion of the fungicide triadimefon to triadimenol. In the present
   study, recombinant human, rat and mouse enzymes together with a highly
   selective 11 beta-HSD1 inhibitor were applied to assess the role of 11
   beta-HSD1 in the reduction of triadimefon and to uncover
   species-specific differences. To further demonstrate the role of 11
   beta-HSD1 in the carbonyl reduction of triadimefon, microsomes from
   liver-specific 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice were employed. Molecular
   docking was applied to investigate substrate binding. The results
   revealed important species differences and demonstrated the irreversible
   11 beta-HSD1-dependent reduction of triadimefon. Human liver microsomes
   showed 4 and 8 times higher activity than rat and mouse liver
   microsomes. The apparent V-max/K-m of recombinant human 11 beta-HSD1 was
   5 and 15 times higher than that of mouse and rat 11 beta-HSD1,
   respectively, indicating isoform-specific differences and different
   expression levels for the three species. Experiments using inhibitors
   and microsomes from 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice indicated that 11
   beta-HSD1 is the major if not only enzyme responsible for triadimenol
   formation. The IC50 values of triadimefon and triadimenol for cortisone
   reduction suggested that exposure to these xenobiotica unlikely impairs
   the 11 beta-HSD1-dependent glucocorticoid activation. However, elevated
   glucocorticoids during stress or upon pharmacological administration
   likely inhibit 11 beta-HSD1-dependent metabolism of triadimefon in
   humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 gene expression are regulated by thyroid hormones in
   adipose tissue
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The aim of this study was to examine whether the relative gene
   expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in rat adipose tissue is altered by
   thyroid hormones, and whether this might relate to their circulating
   thyroid hormones and adiponectin levels. Hyper- and hypothyroidism were
   induced by daily oral administration of levothyroxine and methimazole in
   rats, respectively, over a 42 days period. Real-time PCR analysis was
   performed to evaluate the changes in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA levels in
   the adipose tissue on days 15, 28, 42, and also 2 weeks after the
   cessation of treatment. In response to treatment with methimazole, mRNA
   levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 decreased in the white adipose tissue
   compared to the euthyroid rats (p < 0.05). This decline was reversible 2
   weeks after treatment cessation. The mRNA levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2
   were increased in the hyperthyroid group of animals compared to
   euthyroid control (p < 0.05), and its changes were reversible 2 weeks
   after treatment cessation (P < 0.05). Adiponectin receptors gene
   expression levels in the adipose tissue of treated animals have positive
   correlations with thyroid hormones concentrations. Our results suggest
   that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 gene expression is regulated by thyroid
   hormones in hypo- and hyperthyroidism.

TI Redox Control of Cardiovascular Homeostasis by Angiotensin II
SO CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB Covalent modification of sulfur-containing amino acids in proteins by
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been attracting attention as a major
   post-translational modification regulating intracellular signal
   transduction pathways. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a major physiologically
   active substrate in renin-angiotensin (RAS) system, plays a central role
   in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular systems. Many evidences show
   that Ang II activates several signaling pathways via an oxidative
   modification of proteins by Ang II-induced ROS. Ang II induced ROS
   production is predominantly regulated by three enzymes: NADPH oxidase,
   mitochondrial respiratory complex, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and
   each enzyme-generating ROS are found to activate appropriate signaling
   pathways via selective oxidation of specific proteins. These reactions
   are negatively regulated by ROS-scavenging enzymes or disulfide bridge
   reducing enzymes, and functional disorders of these enzymes are found to
   cause cardiovascular dysfunctions. Thus, the spatial and temporal
   regulation of oxidative modification of signaling proteins by ROS is
   essential to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis by Ang II. This review
   brings in the new aspect in understanding ROS-mediated regulation of
   cardiovascular homeostasis by Ang II, and provides the possible
   mechanisms underlying metamorphosis of cardiovascular homeostasis by
   ROS.

SO CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION
AB Programmed cell death is an important process during development that
   serves to remove superfluous cells and tissues, such as larval organs
   during metamorphosis, supernumerary cells during nervous system
   development, muscle patterning and cardiac morphogenesis. Different
   kinds of cell death have been observed and were originally classified
   based on distinct morphological features: (1) type I programmed cell
   death (PCD) or apoptosis is recognized by cell rounding, DNA
   fragmentation, externalization of phosphatidyl serine, caspase
   activation and the absence of inflammatory reaction, (2) type II PCD or
   autophagy is characterized by the presence of large vacuoles and the
   fact that cells can recover until very late in the process and (3)
   necrosis is associated with an uncontrolled release of the intracellular

   induces an inflammatory response. In this review, we will focus

TI Angiogenesis in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland alters its
   structure and function
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The pars distalis (PD) and the pars intermedia (PI) have the same
   embryonic origin, but their morphological and functional characteristics
   diverge during development. The PD is highly vascularized, whereas the
   highly innervated PI is essentially non-vascularized. Based on our
   previous finding that vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is
   involved in vascularization of the rat PD, attempt was made to generate
   transgenic Xenopus expressing VEGF-A specifically in the melanotrope
   cells of the PI as a model system for studying the significance of
   vascularization or avascularization for the functional differentiation
   of the pituitary. The PI of the transgenic frogs, examined after
   metamorphosis, were distinctly vascularized but poorly innervated. The
   experimentally induced vascularization in the PI resulted in a marked
   increase in tissue volume and a decrease in the expression of both
   alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and prohormone
   convertase 2, a cleavage enzyme essential for generating alpha-MSH. The
   transgenic animals had low plasma alpha-MSH concentrations and displayed
   incomplete adaptation to a black background. To our knowledge, this is
   the first report indicating that experimentally induced angiogenesis in
   the PI may bring about functional as well as structural alterations in

TI Combining case-based reasoning with Bee Colony Optimization for dose
   planning in well differentiated thyroid cancer treatment
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine carcinomas. Case-based
   reasoning (CBR) is used in this paper to describe a physician's
   expertise, intuition and experience when treating patients with well
   differentiated thyroid cancer. Various clinical parameters (the
   patient's diagnosis, the patient's age, the tumor size, the existence of
   metastases in the lymph nodes and the existence of distant metastases)
   influence a physician's decision-making in dose planning. The weights
   (importance) of these parameters are determined here with the Bee Colony
   Optimization (BCO) meta-heuristic. The proposed CBR-BCO model suggests
   the I-131 iodine dose in radioactive iodine therapy. This approach is
   tested on real data from patients treated in the Department of Nuclear
   Medicine, Clinical Center Kragujevac, Serbia. By comparing the results
   that are obtained through the developed CBR-BCO model with those
   resulting from the physician's decision, it has been found that the
   developed model is highly reflective of reality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The histone H3K27 methylation mark regulates intestinal epithelial cell
   density-dependent proliferation and the inflammatory response
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Polycomb-group proteins form multimeric protein complexes involved in
   transcriptional silencing. The Polycomb Repressive complex 2 (PRC2)
   contains the Suppressor of Zeste-12 protein (Suz12) and the histone
   methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste protein-2 (Ezh2). This complex,
   catalyzing the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27, is
   essential for embryonic development and stem cell renewal. However, the
   role of Polycomb-group protein complexes in the control of the
   intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) phenotype is not known. We show that
   Suz12 and Ezh2 were differentially expressed along the intestinal
   crypt-villus axis. ShRNA-mediated Suz12 depletion in the IEC-6 rat
   crypt-derived cell line decreased Ezh2 expression and H3K27
   di-trimethylation. Suz12-depleted cells achieved higher cell densities
   after confluence, with increased cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 protein levels,
   and increased STAT3 activation in post-confluent cells. Suz12 depletion
   specifically increased mostly developmental, cell adhesion and immune
   response gene expression, including neuronal and inflammatory genes.
   Suz12 depletion directly and indirectly de-regulated the IL-1-dependent
   inflammatory response, as demonstrated by decreased MAPK p38 activation
   as opposed to JNK activation, and altered basal and stimulated
   expression of inflammatory genes, including transcription factors such
   as C/EBP. Of note, this positive effect on cell proliferation and
   inflammatory gene expression was revealed in the absence of the
   cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, a main target negatively
   regulated by PRC2. These results demonstrate that the PRC2 complex, in
   addition to keeping in check non-IEC differentiation pathways, insures
   the proper IEC response to cell density as well as to external growth
   and inflammatory signals, by controlling specific signaling pathways. J.

TI Effects of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, on the
   proliferative and differentiation capabilities of bone marrow
   mesenchymal stromal cells in ovariectomized rats
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) potentially regulate the proliferation,
   differentiation, and premature senescence of bone marrow mesenchymal
   stem/stromal cells (MSCs). In the present study we investigated the
   effects mediated by endogenous GCs and the effects of an antagonist of
   the glucocorticoid receptor, RU486, on the proliferative and
   differentiation capabilities of MSCs using an ovariectomized (OVX)
   animal model. Following ovariectomy and a decrease in systemic estradiol
   levels, the serum concentration of corticosterone is significantly
   increased in OVX rats. Compared to sham-operated controls, the total
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum of OVX rats and the
   proliferation of their MSCs are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the
   osteogenic differentiation capabilities of OVX rat MSCs are
   significantly decreased, while adipogenic capabilities tend to increase.
   Subcutaneous administration of RU486 effectively increases the
   population and proliferative capacity of the MSCs in OVX rats. RU486
   treatment also improves osteogenic capabilities and down-regulates
   adipogenic capabilities of MSCs. These results strongly indicate that
   the elevated levels of endogenous GCs induced by estrogen depletion
   might accelerate the premature senescence of MSCs and reduce their
   proliferative and osteogenic differentiation capabilities, while the
   blockage of the effects of endogenous GCs may restore their
   capabilities. These responses could potentially be developed to protect
   the capabilities of MSCs from oxidative stress-induced premature
   senescence and extend their lifespan in patients with advancing age and
   estrogen depletion. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by

TI Pre- and post-natal stress have opposing effects on social information
   use
SO BIOLOGY LETTERS
AB Theoretical models of social learning predict that animals should copy
   others in variable environments where resource availability is
   relatively unpredictable. Although short-term exposure to unpredictable
   conditions in adulthood has been shown to encourage social learning,
   virtually nothing is known concerning whether and how developmental
   conditions affect social information use. Unpredictable food
   availability increases levels of the stress hormone corticosterone
   (CORT). In birds, CORT can be transferred from the mother to her eggs,
   and have downstream behavioural effects. We tested how pre-natal CORT
   elevation through egg injection, and chick post-natal development in
   unpredictable food conditions, affected social information use in adult
   Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Pre-natal CORT exposure encouraged
   quail to copy the foraging decisions of demonstrators in video
   playbacks, whereas post-natal food unpredictability led individuals to
   avoid the demonstrated food source. An individual's exposure to stress
   and uncertainty during development can thus affect its use of social
   foraging information in adulthood. However, the stressor's nature and
   developmental timing determine whether an adult will tend to copy
   conspecifics or do the opposite. Developmental effects on social
   information use might thus help explain individual differences in social
   foraging tactics and leadership.

TI THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF ACUTE VS. CHRONIC STRESS AND THEIR
   COMBINATION ON HIPPOCAMPAL PARVALBUMIN AND INDUCIBLE HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN
   70 EXPRESSION
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB The hippocampus plays a central role in stress-related mood disorders.
   The effects of acute vs. chronic stress on the integrity of hippocampal
   circuitry in influencing the vulnerability to, or resiliency against,
   neuronal injury are poorly understood. Here we investigated whether
   acute vs. chronic psychosocial isolation stress or a combination of the
   two (chronic stress followed by acute stress) influences the expression
   of the interneuronal marker parvalbumin (PV) and the chaperone-inducible
   heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70i) in different subregions of the
   hippocampus. Low levels of the Ca2+-binding protein (PV) may increase
   the vulnerability to neuronal injury, and Hsp70i represents an indicator
   of intense excitation-induced neuronal stress. Adult male Wistar rats
   were exposed to 2 h of immobilization (IM) or cold (4 degrees C) (acute
   stressors), 21 d of social isolation (chronic stress), or a combination
   of both acute and chronic stress. Both chronic isolation and the
   combined stressors strongly decreased the PV-Immunoreactive cells in the
   CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus, while acute
   stress did not affect PV expression. The combination of acute and
   chronic stress induced a dramatic increase in Hsp70i expression in the
   DG, but Hsp70i expression was unaffected in acute and chronic stress
   alone. We also monitored serum corticosterone (CORT) levels as a
   neuroendocrine marker of the stress response. Acute stress increased
   CORT levels, while chronic isolation stress compromised hypothalamic
   pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity such that the normal stress
   response was impaired following subsequent acute stress. These results
   indicate that in contrast to acute stress, chronic isolation compromises
   the HPA axis and generates a considerable reduction in PV expression,
   representing a decrease in the calcium-buffering capacity and a
   putatively higher vulnerability of specific hippocampal interneurons to
   excitotoxic injury. The induction of Hsp70i expression in response to
   acute and chronic isolation reveals that neurons in the DG are
   particularly vulnerable to an acute stressor following a chronic
   perturbation of HPA activity. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI SINGLE INTRANASAL NEUROPEPTIDE Y INFUSION ATTENUATES DEVELOPMENT OF
   PTSD-LIKE SYMPTOMS TO TRAUMATIC STRESS IN RATS
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB Exposure to severe stress leads to development of neuropsychiatric
   disorders, including depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
   (PTSD) in at-risk individuals. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is associated with
   resilience or improved recovery. Therefore exogenous administration to
   the brain has therapeutic potential although peripheral administration
   can trigger undesirable side effects. Here, we established conditions
   with intranasal (IN) NPY infusion to rats to obtain CSF concentrations
   in the proposed anxiolytic range without significant change in plasma
   NPY. Rats were pretreated with IN NPY or vehicle before exposure to
   single prolonged stress (SPS) animal model of PTSD and compared to
   untreated controls. The IN NPY appeared to lessen the perceived severity
   of stress, as these animals displayed less time immobile in forced swim
   part of the SPS. Thirty minutes after SPS the elevation of plasma
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone was not as
   pronounced in NPY-infused rats and the induction of tyrosine hydroxylase
   (TH) in locus coeruleus (LC) was attenuated. Seven days after SPS, they
   displayed lower depressive-like behavior on Forced Swim Test and reduced
   anxiety-like behavior on Elevated Plus Maze. The prolonged effect of SPS
   on Acoustic Startle Response was also lower in NPY-infused rats. Plasma
   ACTH, corticosterone, and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor levels
   were significantly above controls only in the vehicle - but not IN
   NPY-treated group 1 week after SPS. Baseline TH mRNA levels in LC did
   not differ among groups, but increased with forced swim in the vehicle -
   but not NPY-pretreated animals. Administration of IN NPY after exposure
   to SPS led to similar, but not identical, reduction in development of
   anxiety, depressive-like behavior and hyperarousal. The results show
   that single IN NPY can alter stress-triggered dysregulation of the
   hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and activation of central
   noradrenergic activity. These findings provide proof of concept for
   potential of IN NPY for non-invasive prophylactic treatment or early
   intervention in response to traumatic stress. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published

TI Brush border myosin Ia inactivation in gastric but not endometrial
   tumors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Brush border Myosin Ia (MYO1A) has been shown to be frequently mutated
   in colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and to have
   tumor suppressor activity in intestinal tumors. Here, we investigated
   the frequency of frameshift mutations in the A8 microsatellite in exon
   28 of MYO1A in MSI gastric and endometrial tumors and found a high
   mutation rate in gastric (22/47; 46.8%) but not endometrial (3/48; 6.2%)
   tumors. Using a regression model, we show that MYO1A mutations are
   likely to confer a growth advantage to gastric, but not endometrial
   tumors. The mutant MYO1A7A protein was shown to lose its membrane
   localization in gastric cancer cells and a cycloheximide-chase assay
   demonstrated that the mutant MYO1A7A protein has reduced stability
   compared to the wild type MYO1A. Frequent MYO1A promoter
   hypermethylation was also found in gastric tumors. Promoter methylation
   negatively correlates with MYO1A mRNA expression in a series of 58
   non-MSI gastric primary tumors (Pearson's r = 0.46; p = 0.0003) but not
   in a cohort of 54 non-MSI endometrial tumors and treatment of gastric
   cancer cells showing high MYO1A promoter methylation with the
   demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, resulted in a significant
   increase of MYO1A mRNA levels. We found that normal gastric epithelial
   cells, but not normal endometrial cells, express high levels of MYO1A.
   Therefore, when considered together, our findings suggest that MYO1A has
   tumor suppressor activity in the normal gastric epithelium but not in
   the normal endometrium and inactivation of MYO1A either genetically or
   epigenetically may confer gastric epithelial cells a growth advantage.

TI Intracellular glucocorticoid receptors in spleen, but not skin, vary
   seasonally in wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus)
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Over the short-term and at physiological doses, acute increases in
   corticosterone (CORT) titres can enhance immune function. There are
   predictable seasonal patterns in both circulating CORT and immune
   function across many animal species, but whether CORT receptor density
   in immune tissues varies seasonally is currently unknown. Using
   radioligand binding assays, we examined changes in concentrations of
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in
   spleen and skin in wild-caught house sparrows in Massachusetts during
   six different life-history stages: moult, early winter, late winter,
   pre-egg-laying, breeding and late breeding. Splenic GR and MR binding
   were highest during the pre-laying period. This may help animals respond
   to immune threats through increased lymphocyte proliferation and/or an
   increase in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, both of which CORT
   can stimulate and in which spleen is involved. A decrease in splenic GR
   and MR during the late breeding period coincides with low baseline and
   stress-induced CORT, suggesting immune function in spleen may be
   relatively CORT-independent during this period. We saw no seasonal
   patterns in GR or MR in skin, suggesting skin's response to CORT is
   modulated primarily via changes in circulating CORT titres and/or via
   local production of CORT in response to wounding and other noxious
   stimuli.

TI Effect of food restriction on cocaine locomotor sensitization in
   Sprague-Dawley rats
SO PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB The interaction between repeated cocaine exposure and food restriction
   on sensitization to the stimulatory effects of cocaine has not been
   characterized.
   To compare cocaine sensitization in rats free fed and food restricted,
   and begin to explore the role of the stress-responsive dynorphin/kappa
   opioid system.
   Male rats were maintained for 10 days on two feeding conditions: free
   fed or food restricted (85 % of free fed weight). Test 1 of locomotor
   reactivity to cocaine (3, 9, or 15 mg/kg, IP) was followed by a
   sensitizing regimen of cocaine exposure (0 or 30 mg/kg/day x 5 days,
   IP), by a 10-day drug-free period, and by Test 2 of reactivity to the
   same cocaine dose. In a second experiment, rats received an injection of
   norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI; 0, 5 or 20 mg/kg, SC) 10 days prior to each
   locomotion test, and plasma corticosterone (CORT) was assessed after
   Test 2.
   On Test 1, it was found that food restriction enhanced locomotor
   responses to all doses of cocaine. On Test 2, it was found that free fed
   and food restricted animals displayed similar sensitized responses to
   cocaine. This, however, was not observed in nor-BNI-treated rats.
   Furthermore, 20 mg/kg nor-BNI reduced both the locomotor response to
   cocaine on Test 2 and the effect of cocaine and food restriction on CORT
   plasma levels.
   These results indicate that the interaction between cocaine
   sensitization and food restriction is not synergistic, and that it
   involves activation of kappa-opioid receptors.

TI Sexual response in female rats with status epilepticus
SO EPILEPSIA
AB Purpose Female sexual function is complex and may be disrupted by
   disease, in particular epilepsy. Chronic seizures in women can have
   adverse effects on reproductive function, but it has been difficult to
   dissociate the effects of epilepsy from those related to anticonvulsant
   medications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sexual behavior
   in female rats submitted to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE).
   Methods Adult female Wistar rats were given saline or pilocarpine
   (350mg/kg, i.p.) to induce SE. The groups were distributed according to
   the treatment or response to pilocarpine: CTRL (control rats maintained
   in the home-cage after saline administration); NSE (nonstatus
   epilepticus, rats that did not display convulsive and intermittent
   seizures after pilocarpine injection) and SE (status epilepticus, rats
   that displayed convulsive and intermittent seizures after pilocarpine
   injection). After 50days, sexual receptivity in the female rats was
   artificially induced via administration of a combination of estradiol
   and progesterone. Sexual behavior was evaluated during three sessions in
   the presence of a sexually experienced male rat. Receptivity and
   proceptivity behaviors, as well as hormones concentrations, were
   monitored. Key Findings Significant decreases in proceptivity and
   receptivity behaviors during the three tests were observed in SE female
   rats. The rejection response was significantly increased in SE rats
   compared with CTRL or NSE groups. Progesterone, testosterone, and
   corticosterone were unchanged between the groups. Significance The SE
   female rats showed lower sexual motivation and performance regardless of
   their steroid hormones levels.

TI Implications of larval diet concentration on post-larval yield in a
   production scale flow-through system for scallops (Pecten maximus
   Lamarck) in Norway
SO AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL
AB In order to optimize Pecten maximus larval performance and post-larval
   yield, larvae were fed five algal concentrations in the range 3-20 cells
   mu L(-1) in 2,800-L flow-through tanks without prophylactic antibiotics.
   Competent larvae were transferred to a commercial hatchery for
   settlement and provided uniform conditions for 4 weeks to observe
   effects. Increased diet concentration increased the sum of fatty acids
   (FA) in the total larval population, reaching 7 and 25 ng FA larvae(-1)
   at 3 and 16 cells mu L(-1), respectively. The FA level in competent
   larvae was not affected by diet concentration and ranged from 30 to 46
   ng larvae(-1). Increased diet concentration increased larval growth
   rate, and the larvae were ready to settle 5 days earlier when fed 16
   cells mu L(-1) compared to 3 cells mu L(-1). Larval ingestion rate
   increased during life span and with increased larval diet
   concentrations, but a considerable amount (40-60 %) of the added algal
   cells was lost from the larval rearing tanks due to the seawater flow.
   There was no effect on larval survival, final post-larval shell height,
   % of competent larvae transferred to settlement, or total yield of
   post-larvae. Final mean post-larval shell height was 509 mu m and 25.5 %
   of competent larvae settled, resulting in a final post-larval yield
   between 6.9 and 17.6 % of the initial number of d3 larvae. Competent
   larvae with similar FA content produced similar numbers of post-larvae
   independent of diet concentration, even if higher diet concentrations
   resulted in higher rates of larval development and metamorphosis.

TI Pollution and physiological variability in gentoo penguins at two
   rookeries with different levels of human visitation
SO ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
AB Human activity and specifically tourism has been increasing in
   Antarctica over the last few years. Few studies have examined the
   indirect effects of human visits on Antarctic penguin rookeries. This
   work aims to study the differences between a highly visited (Hannah
   Point) and a rarely visited (Devil's Point, Byers Peninsula) gentoo
   penguin rookery on Livingston Island. Our results suggest that potential
   indirect effects of human impact are observed in gentoo penguins at
   Hannah Point, a colony heavily visited by tourists. Penguins at Hannah
   Point showed a higher presence of heavy metals such as Pb and Ni and a
   higher number of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities than penguins at
   Devil's Point. Immunological parameters showed different results
   depending on whether we consider the cellular response - the number of
   lymphocytes being higher in penguins from Hannah Point - or the humoral
   response - the level of immunoglobulins being higher in penguins from
   Devil's Point. Measurements of corticosterone levels in feathers and
   heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio in blood showed lower levels in the
   heavily visited rookery than in the rarely visited rookery. Finally, we
   did not detect Campylobacter jejuni, a bacteria potentially transmitted
   by humans in either of the populations and we did not find any
   difference in the prevalence of Campylobacter lari between the
   populations.

   any of the cognitive variables at either wave. There was no suggestion
   of non-linear associations. The lack of associations supports
   suggestions that the effects of thyroid hormones on cognition may be
   restricted to older individuals above a given threshold, and/or those
   with levels of thyroid hormones within the range defining clinical
   thyroid disorder. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI VDR hypermethylation and HIV-induced T cell loss
SO JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
AB Epigenetics contributes to the development of variety of diseases by
   modulation of gene expression. We evaluated the effect of HIV-induced
   VDR methylation on loss of TCs. HIV/TC displayed enhanced VDR-CpG
   methylation and increased expression of Dnmt3b but attenuated expression
   of VDR. A demethylating agent, AZA, inhibited this effect of HIV. HIV/TC
   also displayed the activation of the RAS, which was reversed by EB (a
   VDA). Further, HIV/TCs displayed enhanced generation of ROS and
   induction of DSBs but attenuated DNA repair response. However, in the
   presence of AZA, EB, LOS (a RAS blocker), Cat, and tempol (free radical
   scavengers), HIV-induced TC ROS generation and induction of DSBs were
   attenuated but associated with enhanced DNA repair. Additionally, AZA,
   EB, and LOS provided protection against HIV-induced TC apoptosis. These
   findings suggested that HIV-induced TC apoptosis was mediated through
   ROS generation in response to HIV-induced VDR methylation and associated
   activation of the RAS. J. Leukoc. Biol. 93: 623-631; 2013.

TI Neuroendocrine Profile in a Rat Model of Psychosocial Stress: Relation
   to Oxidative Stress
SO ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING
AB Aims: Psychosocial stress alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
   (HPA-axis). Increasing evidence shows a link between these alterations
   and oxidant elevation. Oxidative stress is implicated in the stress
   response and in the pathogenesis of neurologic and psychiatric diseases.
   NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are a major source of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) in the central nervous system. Here, we investigated the
   contributory role of NOX2-derived ROS to the development of
   neuroendocrine alterations in a rat model of chronic psychosocial
   stress, the social isolation. Results: Significant elevations in the
   hypothalamic levels of corticotropin-releasing factor and plasmatic
   adrenocorticotropic hormone were observed from 4 weeks of social
   isolation. Increased levels of peripheral markers of the HPA-axis
   (plasmatic and salivary corticosterone) were observed at a later time
   point of social isolation (7 weeks). Alteration in the exploratory
   activity of isolated rats followed the same time course. Increased
   expression of markers of oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine
   [8OhdG] and nitrotyrosine) and NOX2 mRNA was early detectable in the
   hypothalamus of isolated rats (after 2 weeks), but later (after 7 weeks)
   in the adrenal gland. A 3-week treatment with the antioxidant/NOX
   inhibitor apocynin stopped the progression of isolation-induced
   alterations of the HPA-axis. Rats with a loss-of-function mutation in
   the NOX2 subunit p47(phox) were totally protected from the alterations
   of the neuroendocrine profile, behavior, and increased NOX2 mRNA
   expression induced by social isolation. Innovation: We demonstrate that
   psychosocial stress induces early elevation of NOX2-derived oxidative
   stress in the hypothalamus and consequent alterations of the HPA-axis,
   leading ultimately to an altered behavior. Conclusion: Pharmacological
   targeting of NOX2 might be of crucial importance for the treatment of
   psychosocial stress-induced psychosis. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 18,

TI Identification of guanine nucleotide-binding protein gamma-7 as an
   epigenetically silenced gene in head and neck cancer by gene expression
   profiling
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Silencing of tumor suppressor genes plays a vital role in head and neck
   carcinogenesis. Aberrant hypermethylation in the promoter region of some
   known or putative tumor suppressor genes occurs frequently during the
   development of various types of cancer including head and neck squamous
   cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study we used an expanded mRNA
   expression profiling approach followed by microarray expression analysis
   to identify epigenetically inactivated genes in HNSCC. Two HNSCC cell
   lines were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine followed by microarray
   analysis to identify epigenetically silenced genes in HNSCC. We found
   1,960, 614 and 427 genes were upregulated in the HNSCC cell lines
   JHU-012, JHU-011 and the combination of both cell lines, respectively.
   HNSCC tumor and normal mucosal samples were used for gene profiling by a
   47K mRNA gene expression array and we found 7,140 genes were
   downregulated in HNSCC tumors compared to normal mucosa, as determined
   by microarray analysis, and were integrated with cell line data.
   Integrative analysis defined 126 candidate genes, of which only seven
   genes showed differential methylation in tumors and no methylation in
   normal mucosa after bisulfite sequencing. Following validation by QMSP,
   one gene, guanine nucleotide-binding protein gamma-7 (GNG7), was
   confirmed to be highly methylated in tumors and unmethylated in normal
   mucosal and salivary rinse samples demonstrating cancer-specific
   methylation in HNSCC tissues. TXNIP and TUSC2 were partially methylated
   in tumors and normal salivary rinses but unmethylated in normal mucosa.
   We concluded that GNG7 is a highly specific promoter methylated gene
   associated with HNSCC. In addition, TXNIP and TUSC2 are also potential
   biomarkers for HNSCC.

TI Functional Analysis of the Murine Pax8 Promoter Reveals Autoregulation
   and the Presence of a Novel Thyroid-Specific DNA-Binding Activity
SO THYROID
AB Background: Organogenesis of the thyroid gland requires the Pax8
   protein. Absence or reduction of Pax8 results in congenital
   hypothyroidism in animal models and humans, respectively. This study
   aims at elucidating the regulatory mechanism leading to the expression
   of Pax8 in thyroid cells.
   Methods: The murine Pax8 gene promoter was functionally dissected by
   mutagenesis and transfection in the thyroid cell line FRTL-5. Nuclear
   factors important for thyroid-specific gene expression were identified
   by DNA-binding assays.
   Results: We show that Pax8 binds to and controls the expression of its
   own promoter. Furthermore, we identify a novel, thyroid-specific,
   DNA-binding activity (denominated nTTF [for novel Thyroid Transcription
   Factor]) that recognizes a specific region of the Pax8 promoter.
   Conclusions: The Pax8 promoter appears to be autoregulated, a feature
   that might be responsible for the haploinsufficiency displayed by this
   gene.

TI The relationship between intracellular and plasma levels of folate and
   metabolites in the methionine cycle: A model
SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Scope Folate status and the status of the methionine cycle are typically
   assessed by measuring folate and metabolites in the plasma. It is
   assumed that plasma metabolite levels are proportional to their levels
   in tissues, but there is little information to support this assumption.
   Methods and results We developed a mathematical model, based on known
   kinetics of the methionine cycle in the liver and tissues, and the
   transport kinetics of metabolites into and out of the plasma. We use the
   model to explore the relationship between folate status and metabolite
   values in the plasma, the relationships between metabolite values and
   methylation capacity, the response to a methionine load, and the
   half-life of folate in plasma and tissues. We also use the model to
   study the effects of Down syndrome and oxidative stress on metabolite
   values in plasma and tissues. The model accurately reproduces measured
   metabolite values pre- and post-folate fortification. The model shows
   that a high acute intake of folate remains largely restricted to the
   plasma and is rapidly excreted; only a prolonged exposure to increased
   folate elevates tissue folate significantly. Conclusion The model
   accurately reproduces experimental and clinical findings and can serve
   as a platform to study, in silico, the relationships between metabolite
   values in tissues and plasma, and how these vary with methionine and B
   vitamin input, and with mutations in the genes for enzymes in the
   methionine cycle.

TI Novel symmetrical ureas as modulators of protein arginine methyl
   transferases
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Methylation of histone arginine residues is an epigenetic mark related
   to gene expression that is implicated in a variety of biological
   processes and can be reversed by small-molecule modulators of protein
   arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). A series of symmetrical ureas,
   designed as analogues of the known PRMT1 inhibitor AMI-1 have been
   synthesized using Pd-catalyzed Ar-N amide bond formation processes or
   carbonylation reactions as key steps. Their inhibitory profile has been
   characterized. The enzymatic assays showed a weak effect on PRMT1 and
   PRMT5 activity for most of the compounds. The acyclic urea that
   exhibited the strongest effect on the inhibition of the PRMT1 activity
   also showed the greatest effect on the expression of some androgen
   receptor target genes (TMPRSS2 and FKBP5), which may be related with its
   enzymatic activity. Surprisingly, AMI-1 behaved as an activator of PRMT5
   activity, a result not reported so far. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Microtubule dynamics alter the interphase nucleus
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB Microtubules are known to drive chromosome movements and to induce
   nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis and meiosis. Here we show that
   microtubules can enforce nuclear envelope folding and alter the levels
   of nuclear envelope-associated heterochromatin during interphase, when
   the nuclear envelope is intact. Microtubule reassembly, after chemically
   induced depolymerization led to folding of the nuclear envelope and to a
   transient accumulation of condensed chromatin at the site nearest the
   microtubule organizing center (MTOC). This microtubule-dependent
   chromatin accumulation next to the MTOC is dependent on the composition
   of the nuclear lamina and the activity of the dynein motor protein. We
   suggest that forces originating from simultaneous polymerization of
   microtubule fibers deform the nuclear membrane and the underlying
   lamina. Whereas dynein motor complexes localized to the nuclear envelope
   that slide along the microtubules transfer forces and/or signals into
   the nucleus to induce chromatin reorganization and accumulation at the
   nuclear membrane folds. Thus, our study identified a molecular mechanism
   by which mechanical forces generated in the cytoplasm reshape the
   nuclear envelope, alter the intranuclear organization of chromatin, and
   affect the architecture of the interphase nucleus.

TI Hyperammonemia alters the modulation by different neurosteroids of the
   glutamate-nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway through NMDA-GABA(A)- or sigma
   receptors in cerebellum in vivo
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY
AB Several neurosteroids modulate the glutamatenitric oxide (NO)cGMP
   pathway in cerebellum through modulation of NMDA- GABAA- or sigma
   receptors. Hyperammonemia alters the concentration of several
   neurosteroids and impairs the glutamateNOcGMP pathway, leading to
   impaired learning ability. This work aimed to assess whether chronic
   hyperammonemia alters the modulation by different neurosteroids of
   GABAA, NMDA, and/or sigma receptors and of the glutamateNOcGMP pathway
   in cerebellum. Neurosteroids were administered through microdialysis
   probes, and extracellular cGMP and citrulline were measured. Then NMDA
   was administered to assess the effects on the glutamateNOcGMP pathway
   activation. Hyperammonemia completely modifies the effects of
   pregnanolone and pregnenolone. Pregnanolone acts as a GABAA receptor
   agonist in controls, but as an NMDA receptor antagonist in
   hyperammonemic rats. Pregnenolone does not induce any effect in
   controls, but acts as a sigma receptor agonist in hyperammonemic rats.
   Hyperammonemia potentiates the actions of tetrahydrodeoxy-corticosterone
   (THDOC) as a GABAA receptor agonist, allopregnanolone as an NMDA
   receptor antagonist, and pregnenolone sulfate as an NMDA receptor
   activation enhancer. Neurosteroids that reduce the pathway
   (pregnanolone, THDOC, allopregnanolone, DHEAS) may contribute to
   cognitive impairment in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pregnenolone would impair cognitive function in hyperammonemia.
   Neurosteroids that restore the pathway in hyperammonemia (pregnenolone
   sulfate) could restore cognitive function in hyperammonemia and
   encephalopathy.

TI Expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase DUSP4 is associated with
   microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer (CRC) and causes
   increased cell proliferation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB DUSP4 (MKP-2), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
   phosphatase (MKP) family and potential tumor suppressor, negatively
   regulates the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) ERK, p38 and
   JNK. MAPKs play a crucial role in cancer development and progression.
   Previously, using microarray analyses we found a conspicuously frequent
   overexpression of DUSP4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) with high frequent
   microsatellite instability (MSI-H) compared to microsatellite stable
   (MSS) CRC. Here we studied DUSP4 expression on mRNA level in 38 CRC (19
   MSI-H and 19 MSS) compared to matched normal tissue as well as in CRC
   cell lines by RT-qPCR. DUSP4 was overexpressed in all 19 MSI-H tumors
   and in 14 MSS tumors. Median expression levels in MSI-H tumors were
   significantly higher than in MSS-tumors (p < 0.001). Consistently, MSI-H
   CRC cell lines showed 6.8-fold higher DUSP4 mRNA levels than MSS cell
   lines. DUSP4 expression was not regulated by promoter methylation since
   no methylation was found by quantitative methylation analysis of DUSP4
   promoter in CRC cell lines neither in tumor samples. Furthermore, no
   DUSP4 mutation was found on genomic DNA level in four CRC cell lines.
   DUSP4 overexpression in CRC cell lines through DUSP4 transfection caused
   upregulated expression of MAPK targets CDC25A, CCND1, EGR1, FOS, MYC and
   CDKN1A in HCT116 as well as downregulation of mismatch repair gene MSH2
   in SW480. Furthermore, DUSP4 overexpression led to increased
   proliferation in CRC cell lines. Our findings suggest that DUSP4 acts as
   an important regulator of cell growth within the MAPK pathway and causes
   enhanced cell growth in MSI-H CRC.

TI Effects of Buprenorphine and Meloxicam Analgesia on Induced Cerebral
   Ischemia in C57BL/6 Male Mice
SO COMPARATIVE MEDICINE
AB Laboratory mice constitute an extensively used model to study the
   pathologic and functional outcomes of cerebral ischemic stroke. The
   middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model requires surgical
   intervention, which potentially can result in post-surgical pain and
   stress. In the present study, we investigated whether buprenorphine and
   meloxicam, at clinically relevant doses provided pain relief without
   altering infarct volume in male C57BL16 mice. Common known side-effects
   of buprenorphine, including decreased food consumption, were noted after
   surgery in buprenorphine-treated mice, but these effects were brief and
   seen only during the treatment period. Fecal corticosterone metabolites
   did not differ significantly between the groups. In the present study,
   buprenorphine treatment did not alter infarction volume when compared
   with that of mice that did not receive analgesia. In contrast, meloxicam
   treatment significantly reduced infarct volume and may be a confounder
   if used as an analgesic during MCAO surgery. Furthermore, investigation
   of behavioral profiles by using an automated behavioral scoring system
   showed that rearing and sniffing behaviors decreased as infarct volume
   increased. This suggests that studies of exploratory behavior may aid in
   developing new markers of short-term stroke-related behavioral
   deficiencies in laboratory mice.

TI Biogas slurry application elevated arsenic accumulation in rice plant
   through increased arsenic release and methylation in paddy soil
SO PLANT AND SOIL
AB Rice can accumulate arsenic (As) to relatively high concentrations due
   to the general flooding practices in rice cultivation, and organic
   matter in the soil strongly affected As bioavailability to rice plants.
   The influence of organic matter input on the As transformation in paddy
   soil and As uptake into rice plants is an area that is rarely
   investigated.
   Biogas slurry (BGS), a commonly used organic fertilizer, was applied to
   an As contaminated paddy soil, in order to investigate the influence of
   organic matter on As transformation in the paddy soil and As
   accumulation in rice plants.
   Application of BGS significantly increased the As accumulation in rice
   plants, especially for methylated As species. Results showed that the
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved Fe(II) in
   the soil solution were significantly increased by the BGS addition into
   the paddy soil, and were significantly correlated to the As
   concentration in the soil solution (P < 0.01). The increase of soil pH
   and the decrease of the soil redox potential (Eh) were observed as well.
   These alteration of soil characteristics elevated the As release from
   soil particles to the soil solution under the addition of BGS. The
   increased concentrations of dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)) and
   monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)) in the soil solution, and the
   volatilized As of trimethylarsine (TMAs) from the paddy soil, suggested
   that As methylation and volatilization in the soil were also enhanced by
   BGS addition. The concentrations of methylated As species in rice husks
   and grains were increased by 105.8-105.9 % and 99.7-112.2 %,
   respectively.
   These results suggested that the use of organic fertilizer, such as BGS
   in As-contaminated paddy soil, can significantly alter the behavior of
   As in soil-rice system and enhance As accumulation in rice plants and
   should therefore be avoided.

TI Evidence for monomeric actin function in INO80 chromatin remodeling
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Actin has well-established functions in the cytoplasm, but its roles in
   the nucleus remain poorly defined. Here, by studying the nuclear
   actin-containing yeast INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, we provide
   genetic and biochemical evidence for a role of monomeric actin in INO80
   chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that, in contrast to cytoplasmic
   actin, nuclear actin is present as a monomer in the INO80 complex, and
   its barbed end is not accessible for polymerization. We identify an
   actin mutation in subdomain 2 affecting in vivo nuclear functions and
   reducing the chromatin remodeling activity of the INO80 complex in
   vitro. Notably, the highly conserved subdomain 2 at the pointed end of
   actin contributes to the interaction of INO80 with chromatin. Our
   results establish an evolutionarily conserved function of nuclear actin
   in its monomeric form and suggest that nuclear actin can utilize a
   fundamentally distinct mechanism from that of cytoplasmic actin.

AB Aging is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated
   with cognitive decline. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of
   brain aging are not clear. Recent studies suggest epigenetic influences
   on gene expression in AD, as DNA methylation levels influence protein
   and mRNA expression in postmortem AD brain. We hypothesized that some of

   measured markers of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade,
   neuroinflammation, pro- and anti-apoptosis factors, and gene specific
   epigenetic modifications in postmortem frontal cortex from nine
   middle-aged [41 +/- 1 (SEM) years] and 10 aged subjects (70 +/- 3years).
   The aged compared with middle-aged brain showed elevated levels of
   neuroinflammatory and AA cascade markers, altered pro and anti-apoptosis
   factors and loss of synaptophysin. Some of these changes correlated with
   promoter hypermethylation of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
   cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), and synaptophysin
   and hypomethylation of BCL-2 associated X protein (BAX). These molecular
   alterations in aging are different from or more subtle than changes
   associated with AD pathology. The degree to which they are related to
   changes in cognition or behavior during normal aging remains to be
   evaluated.

TI Feeding response following central administration of chicken vasoactive
   intestinal peptide in chicks
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is expressed in central nervous
   systems and peripheral tissues across lower and higher vertebrates and
   is involved in many physiological functions. One of these functions is
   appetite regulation; however the mechanisms mediating this response are
   poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
   investigate central mechanisms of VIP induction of satiety using chicks
   as models. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of VIP (0.1 and 0.5
   nmol) significantly decreased food intake under both ad libitum and food
   deprivation conditions and chicken VIP (cVIP) was more potent than
   mammalian VIP. The mechanisms involved with the VIP-induced anorexigenic
   effect were investigated by studying the involvement of the central
   corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) systems. ICV injection of cVIP
   caused increased plasma corticosterone concentration and decreased
   diencephalic mRNA expression of CRH, CRH receptor-2 (CRH-R2) and
   urocortin 3 (UCN-3, which has high affinity for CRH-R2). This
   simultaneous decrease in the expression of ligands and their receptor,
   with the increase in plasma corticosterone concentration suggests that
   the anorexigenic effect of cVIP might be related to CRH systems. The
   cVIP-induced anorexigenic effect was partly attenuated by co-injection
   of astressin, a CRH-R2 antagonist, supporting this thesis. The present
   study demonstrated that VIP inhibits feeding behavior via CRH systems in
   the brain of chicks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Incretin-based therapies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes - More than
   meets the eye?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB A lot of contradictory data regarding the serious side effects of
   incretin-based therapies are currently available, with more being
   prepared or published every month. Considering the widespread use of
   these drugs it should be considered a priority to establish both
   short-and long-term risks connected with incretin treatment. We
   performed an extensive literature search of the PubMed database looking
   for articles dealing with connections between incretin-based therapies
   and pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer and other neoplasms.
   Data obtained indicate that GLP-1 agonists and DPPIV inhibitors could
   increase the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, possibly due to
   their capacity to increase ductal cell turnover, which has previously
   been found to be up-regulated in patients with obesity and T2DM. GLP-1
   analogues exenatide and liraglutide seem to be connected with medullary
   thyroid carcinoma in rat models and, surprisingly, GLP-1 receptors have
   been found in papillary thyroid carcinoma, currently the most common
   neoplasm of the thyroid gland in humans. Changes in expression of DPPIV
   have been described in ovarian carcinoma, melanoma, endometrial
   adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and in
   certain haematological malignancies. In most cases loss of DPPIV
   activity is connected with a higher grading scale, more aggressive
   tumour behaviour and higher metastatic potential. In conclusion animal
   and human studies indicate that there could be a connection between
   incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, thyroid
   cancer and other neoplasms. Therefore whenever such therapy is started
   it would be wise to proceed with caution, especially if personal history
   of neoplasms is present. (C) 2013 European Federation of Internal

TI The ANK3 Bipolar Disorder Gene Regulates Psychiatric-Related Behaviors
   That Are Modulated by Lithium and Stress
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) has been strongly implicated as a risk gene
   for bipolar disorder (BD) by recent genome-wide association studies of
   patient populations. However, the genetic variants of ANK3 contributing
   to BD risk and their pathological function are unknown.
   Methods: To gain insight into the potential disease relevance of ANK3,
   we examined the function of mouse Ank3 in the regulation of
   psychiatric-related behaviors using genetic, neurobiological,
   pharmacological, and gene-environment interaction (G x E) approaches.
   Ank3 expression was reduced in mouse brain either by viral-mediated RNA
   interference or through disruption of brain-specific Ank3 in a
   heterozygous knockout mouse.
   Results: RNA interference of Ank3 in hippocampus dentate gyrus induced a
   highly specific and consistent phenotype marked by decreased
   anxiety-related behaviors and increased activity during the light phase,
   which were attenuated by chronic treatment with the mood stabilizer
   lithium. Similar behavioral alterations of reduced anxiety and increased
   motivation for reward were also exhibited by Ank3+/- heterozygous mice
   compared with wild-type Ank3+/+ mice. Remarkably, the behavioral traits
   of Ank3+/- mice transitioned to depression-related features after
   chronic stress, a trigger of mood episodes in BD. Ank3+/- mice also
   exhibited elevated serum corticosterone, suggesting that reduced Ank3
   expression is associated with elevated stress reactivity.
   Conclusions: This study defines a new role for Ank3 in the regulation of
   psychiatric-related behaviors and stress reactivity that lends support
   for its involvement in BD and establishes a general framework for
   determining the disease relevance of genes implicated by patient
   genome-wide association studies.

TI Contrasting engineering effects of leaf-rolling caterpillars on a
   tropical mite community
SO ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB Ecosystem engineers are organisms that change the physical structure of
   environments and provide habitats for other organisms. Lepidopteran
   caterpillars may act as ecosystem engineers by rolling leaves as
   shelters to complete metamorphosis. After being abandoned, these
   structures may provide shelter for other organisms. In this study, the
   influence of leaf-rolling caterpillars on tropical mite communities was
   reported. Expanded leaves and leaves rolled by larvae and also developed
   field experiments using leaves rolled manually with different shapes and
   sizes (i.e. different architectures) in different seasons were surveyed
   (dry and rainy). While the abundance and diversity of predatory mites
   were higher in rolled leaves, the abundance of phytophages decreased in
   these leaves. Species composition differed between rolled and expanded
   leaves. The structure of shelters affected the distribution of predatory
   mites, with higher abundances found on funnel-shaped leaves. Predatory
   mites only benefited from the rolled leaves in the dry season. This is
   the first study showing (i) the contrasting effects of ecosystem
   engineers on microarthropod communities, favouring some feeding guilds
   and inhibiting others; (ii) that the shape of rolled leaves has variable
   effects on mite communities; and (iii) that facilitation was temporally
   dependent, i.e. occurred only in the dry season.

TI Molecular characterization of two trypsinogens in the orange-spotted
   grouper, Epinephelus coioides, and their expression in tissues during
   early development
SO FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In this study, we cloned two trypsinogens of the orange-spotted grouper,
   Epinephelus coioides, and analyzed their structure, expression, and
   activity. Full-length trypsinogen complementary (c)DNAs, named T1 and
   T2, were 900 and 875 nucleotides, and translated 242 and 244 deduced
   amino acid peptides, respectively. Both trypsinogens contained highly
   conserved residues essential for serine protease catalytic and
   conformational maintenance. Results from isoelectric and phylogenetic
   analyses suggested that both trypsinogens were grouped into trypsinogen
   group I. Both trypsinogens had similar expression patterns of negative
   relationship with body weight; expression was first detected at 1 day
   post-hatching (DPH) and exhibited steady-state expression during early
   development at 1-25 DPH. Both expression and activity levels
   significantly increased after 30 DPH due to metamorphosis. Grouper
   larval development is very slow with insignificant changes in total
   length and body weight before 8 DPH. The contribution of live food to an
   increase in the trypsin activity profile may explain their importance in
   food digestion and survival of larvae during early larval development.

TI Swimming exercise ameliorates depression-like behavior in chronically
   stressed rats: Relevant to proinflammatory cytokines and IDO activation
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Chronic stress is involved in development of depression and causes
   immune alterations. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) plays a pivotal
   role in mediating the depression-like behaviors in response to immune
   activation. Physical exercise has been shown to reduce the stress
   impairment and ameliorate depressive symptoms. The objectives of present
   study were to confirm that chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)
   induces depression-like behavior and inflammatory responses within the
   brain, and then investigate whether swimming exercise alleviates the
   depression-like behaviors induced by CUMS through proinflammatory
   cytokine-induced alteration of IDO in brain. It has been found that CUMS
   exposure induced depression-like behavior, increased serum
   corticosterone (CORT) level, decreased 5-HT level, increased IFN-gamma
   and TNF-alpha levels and elevated IDO activity in prefrontal cortex.
   Moreover, the level of 5-HT was inversely correlated with IDO level.
   Regular swimming exercise ameliorated depressive symptoms induced by
   CUMS. The exercise reduced serum CORT level, increased 5-HT level as
   well as decreased levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IDO in prefrontal
   cortex in CUMS rats. These findings suggested that CUMS activate HPA
   axis and induce immune activation, which may stimulate IDO activity,
   leading to the reduction of 5-HT level in brain, thereby resulting in
   depression. Swimming exercise may inhibit activation of inflammation/IDO
   pathways induced by CUMS, thereby ameliorating depression. (C) 2013

TI An epigenetic role for PRL-3 as a regulator of H3K9 methylation in
   colorectal cancer
SO GUT
AB Objective This study investigated the epigenetic role of PRL-3, a key
   metastasis gene in colorectal cancer (CRC), as a regulator of histone
   demethylation and the functions of Jumonji domain-containing protein 1B
   (JMJD1B) and JMJD2B in the progression of CRC.
   Methods PRL-3-associated proteins were analysed using functional
   distribution and category enrichment analysis. Western blotting and
   immunofluorescence were used to detect nuclear PRL-3. The relationship
   between PRL-3 and JMJD1B or JMJD2B and the roles of JMJD1B, JMJD2B and
   PRL-3 in histone demethylation were determined after these proteins were
   knocked down using RNA interference. Case-control studies on JMJD1B and
   JMJD2B in patients with CRC were performed using immunohistochemical
   analysis. The in vitro functional effects of JMJD2B and JMJD1B were
   examined further.
   Results JMJD1B and JMJD2B, two histone demethylases, were enriched among
   PRL-3-associated proteins. Nuclear PRL-3 was observed in CRC cells and
   clinical samples of CRC. The expression of nuclear PRL-3 was increased
   in patients with CRC at more advanced Dukes' stages. PRL-3 was involved
   in the regulation of histone methylation by affecting the activities of
   JMJD1B and JMJD2B. A low expression of the JMJD1B protein was positively
   correlated with the lymph node status (p=0.032), Dukes' classification
   (p=0.008) and TNM staging (p=0.022) of patients with CRC. A high
   expression of JMJD2B was positively correlated with the lymph node
   status (p=0.03), Dukes' classification (p=0.036) and tumour invasion
   (p=0.003) of patients with CRC. A loss-of-function analysis confirmed
   that JMJD2B promoted the proliferation, colony formation and migration
   of human CRC cells.
   Conclusion Our data reveal a new role for PRL-3 as a key regulator of
   histone demethylation. JMJD1B seems to be a candidate tumour suppressor
   and JMJD2B seems to be a potential oncoprotein in the development and
   progression of CRC.

TI Linking adaptation, delimitation of evolutionarily significant units
   (ESUs), and gene function: a case study using hemlock looper ecotypes
SO SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB Developing genetic markers for the identification of recently diverged
   groups, such as ecotypes or species complexes, remains difficult due to
   challenges with incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and
   introgression. Genome-wide scans of single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) have proven useful for inferring patterns of genetic
   differentiation at the population level. In combination with a new
   analytical technique, the discriminant analysis of principal components
   (DAPC), and within the framework of iterative taxonomy, it may also be
   possible to extract a combination of SNPs as markers for the
   delimitation of closely related groups. In addition, since DAPC
   identifies the loci contributing the most to group clustering, it may be
   possible to link putative biological function to differences that define
   group boundaries. We tested this technique on two ecotypes of the
   hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria), which differ in terms of number
   of larval stadia, developmental rate and fecundity. It was possible to
   separately cluster the two ecotypes with 95% correct assignment using 27
   SNPs. We also determined that a storage hexamerin carried eight of these
   SNPs, including the two highest contributing loci, of which the top
   contributor was nonsynonymous. Other studies have found this protein to
   be highly expressed just before metamorphosis, pointing to a possible
   connection between its role in clustering ecotypes and its biological
   function. These SNP markers can now be further developed for high
   throughput delimitation of individuals of unknown ecotype identity.

   GARIEPINUS
SO CRUSTACEANA
AB The postembryonic development of the gill parasite, Lanzproglena
   clariae, infecting the sharp tooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus was
   established from egg culture and artificial infection of fish under
   laboratory conditions. Like most fish parasitic copepods, L. clariae has
   a direct life cycle utilizing only a single fish host species. Adult
   post metamorphosis females produce two egg strings. The mean number of
   eggs in each egg string was 52. Three naupliar and first copepodid
   stages were obtained in culture while two copepodid stages, cyclopoid
   and adult specimens were obtained after artificial infection of catfish
   in aquaria. First stage nauplii were globular in shape and densely
   filled with yolk. Nauplii lacked a perforation for the mouth and
   masticatory parts of the appendages, all of which indicate that they do
   not feed. Body architecture of the first copepodid stage of L. clariae
   is similar to that of all other copepods in the number and kind of
   somites: a cephalothorax with five appendages, three thoracic somites,
   one abdominal somite and furca rami. This seems to be a conserved
   morphology among the copepods. The three naupliar and three copepodid
   stages are described and compared to related copepods.

TI Glucocorticoids regulate metallothionein-1/2 expression in rat choroid
   plexus: effects on apoptosis
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The choroid plexus (CP) participates in the synthesis, secretion and
   regulation of the cerebrospinal fluid, in the removal of its toxic
   compounds and in the regulation of the availability of essential metal
   ions to the brain. It expresses and secretes metallothioneins 1/2
   (MT-1/2) which are key components in the maintenance of the central
   nervous system metal homeostasis and have anti-apoptotic properties,
   thereby protecting the brain. Glucocorticoids regulate MT-1/2 expression
   in several brain regions, but within the choroid plexuses (CPs) it
   remains unknown. Glucocorticoid levels increase in response to stress
   with implications in apoptosis. Further, CP expresses glucocorticoid
   (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) turning it into likely
   glucocorticoid responsive structure. Data prompted us to study the
   regulation of MT-1/2 expression in response to glucocorticoids in the
   rat CP, and to investigate its implications in apoptosis. MT-1/2 protein
   and mRNA expression analysis showed that hydrocortisone up-regulates
   MT-1/2 expression in rat choroid plexus (RCP) cell line and in primary
   cultures of choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) cultures via GR and
   MR. Also, incubation of RCP cells with hydrocortisone significantly
   diminished apoptosis, an effect eliminated by the addition of a MT-1/2
   antibody. Moreover, induction of psychosocial stress, with concomitant
   rise of corticosterone levels, increased MT-1/2 expression in liver and
   in CP of male and female rats, with an exception observed in CP from
   males subjected to acute stress in which down-regulation in MT-1/2
   expression occurred. Altogether, the results obtained demonstrated that
   stress/glucocorticoids regulate MT-1/2 expression in rat CP, with
   implications on apoptosis.

TI DsRed-mediated oligomerization stabilizes HMGB1 on chromatin in vivo and
   on DNA in vitro
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is remarkably mobile in living cells,
   which reflects its ability to interact only transiently with both DNA
   and protein. This property is likely essential for HMGB1 nuclear
   activities. Nonetheless the weak interaction of HMGB1 with DNA and/or
   protein partners has also been a major limitation for investigating
   HMGB1 subnuclear localisation and for the identification of HMGB1
   containing complexes by conventional biochemical approaches. In the
   present study, FRAP experiments demonstrated that DsRed-mediated
   oligomerization strongly reduces HMGB1 mobility due to an increased
   affinity for cellular chromatin. Moreover, oligomerized DsRed HMGB1
   exhibited a higher affinity for supercoiled DNA in vitro compared to its
   monomeric counterpart. These results indicate that DsRed-meditated
   oligomerization is prone to stabilize labile interactions involving
   HMGB1 both in vivo and in vitro. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

TI Silibinin inhibits TPA-induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression in
   thyroid and breast cancer cells
SO ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in cancer
   metastasis, cell migration and invasion. Herein, we investigated the
   effects of silibinin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
   (TPA)-induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression in thyroid and breast
   cancer cells. Our results revealed that the levels of MMP-9 mRNA and
   protein expression were significantly increased by TPA but not MMP-2 in
   TPC-1 and MCF7 cells. To verify the regulatory mechanism of TPA-induced
   MMP-9 expression, we treated TPC-1 and MCF7 cells with the MEK1/2
   inhibitor, UO126, and TPA-induced MMP-9 expression was significantly
   decreased. We also found that TPA-induced cell migration and MMP-9
   expression was significantly decreased by silibinin. In addition,
   TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was also inhibited by
   silibinin. Taken together, we suggest that silibinin suppresses
   TPA-induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression through the
   MEK/ERK-dependent pathway in thyroid and breast cancer cells.

TI Epigenetics of sex determination and gonadogenesis
SO DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS
AB Epigenetics is commonly defined as the study of heritable changes in
   gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence. The
   three major epigenetic mechanisms for gene expression regulation include
   DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic
   mechanisms provide organisms with the ability to integrate genomic and
   environmental information to modify the activity of their genes for
   generating a particular phenotype. During development, cells
   differentiate, acquire, and maintain identity through changes in gene
   expression. This is crucial for sex determination and differentiation,
   which are among the most important developmental processes for the
   proper functioning and perpetuation of species. This review summarizes
   studies showing how epigenetic regulatory mechanisms contribute to sex
   determination and reproductive organ formation in plants, invertebrates,
   and vertebrates. Further progress will be made by integrating several
   approaches, including genomics and Next Generation Sequencing to create
   epigenetic maps related to different aspects of sex determination and
   gonadogenesis. Epigenetics will also contribute to understand the
   etiology of several disorders of sexual development. It also might play
   a significant role in the control of reproduction in animal farm
   production and will aid in recognizing the environmental versus genetic
   influences on sex determination of sensitive species in a global change

   Peninsula 100 years ago and its distribution has steadily increased
   since then. We studied the effects of this non-native amphibian species
   on the native ones in the northeastern area of the peninsula. We
   compared amphibian assemblages in regions with and without D. pictus to
   estimate niche overlap between species. Additionally, we carried out a
   laboratory evaluation of the effects of competition between the
   non-native and the two native species with which it overlaps most
   commonly: Bufo calamita and Pelodytes punctatus. The presence of D.
   pictus larvae reduced the survival, body mass and activity of B.
   calamita, and increased time to metamorphosis. Furthermore, D. pictus
   showed the highest consumption rate while P. punctatus showed the
   lowest. One possible consequence of these competitive interactions is an
   alteration of species co-occurrence patterns in the recipient community
   on a regional scale. In the non-invaded area, the checkerboard score
   (C-score) of co-occurrence indicated that the community was structured,
   whereas the standardized C-score in the invaded area indicated that the
   community did not differ significantly from having a random structure.
   These results suggest that competition between native and non-native
   species can cause recipient communities to become less structured.

TI Thyroid hormones and erythrocyte indices in a cohort of euthyroid older
   subjects
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB Objectives: Hypothyroidism is associated with normocytic anaemia.
   Indeed, a limited number of studies have shown significant associations
   between free thyroxin (T4) and erythrocyte indices. These studies did
   not include vitamin B12, folic acid, iron and renal function in the
   analyses. We therefore studied the association between thyroid hormones
   and erythrocyte indices in a population-based cohort of older euthyroid
   subjects, with adjustment for major confounding parameters.
   Design: Data, including thyroid hormones and erythrocyte indices, are
   from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam(LASA), an ongoing cohort
   study on predictors and consequences of changes in health in the ageing
   population in the Netherlands. Multivariable linear regression analyses
   were applied to study the cross-sectional associations between free T4,
   thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin
   content, haematocrit, mean cell volume (MCV) and erythrocyte count) in a
   euthyroid sub-sample. The final models were adjusted for vitamin B12,
   folic acid, iron levels and renal function.
   Results: In 708 euthyroid older subjects, an increase of 5 pmol/L free
   T4 was associated with a mean increase of 0.12 mmol/L or 0.19 g/dL of
   haemoglobin, 0.068 10(12)/L erythrocytes and 0.006 L/L haematocrit
   (P=0.007, P= 0.005, P-0.001, respectively). Free T4 was not
   significantly associated with MCV (P>0.05). TSH appeared not to be
   associated with any of the erythrocyte indices (all P>0.05).
   Conclusions: In a cohort of older subjects, free T4, but not TSH, was
   associated with erythrocyte indices, confirming the role of thyroid
   hormones in the regulation of erythropoiesis. (C) 2012 European

TI Methylation-controlled J-protein MCJ acts in the import of proteins into
   human mitochondria
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB Loss of expression of the methylation-controlled J gene, MCJ (DNAJC15),
   is observed in cases of several tumors and plays a crucial role in the
   chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. Aside from the
   pathophysiological effects, almost nothing is known about the cellular
   function of MCJ. Here, we provide the first evidence that MCJ acts in
   the biogenesis of mitochondria. Our results demonstrate that MCJ is
   located in mitochondria. It is anchored in the mitochondrial inner
   membrane with the C-terminal J domain facing the matrix space. We show
   that MCJ forms a stable subcomplex with a component of the mitochondrial
   import motor, MAGMAS, a protein overexpressed in cells treated with
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and in prostate
   carcinomas. In addition, MCJ and MAGMAS interact with the core
   components of the TIM23 pre-protein translocase. We demonstrate that the
   recombinant soluble MCJ domain stimulates the ATPase activity of the
   human mtHsp70 chaperone, mortalin, the central component of the import
   motor of the TIM23 translocase. This stimulation is counteracted by
   MAGMAS. Moreover, pre-protein import into mitochondria is impaired in
   the absence of MCJ. Interestingly, MCJ is able to take over the function
   of Tim14, the essential J co-chaperone of the mitochondrial protein
   import motor in yeast. In summary, our results show that MCJ functions
   as J co-chaperone of the human TIM23 pre-protein translocase, suggesting
   a link between mitochondrial pre-protein import and tumorigenesis.

TI FANCJ couples replication past natural fork barriers with maintenance of
   chromatin structure
SO JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB Defective DNA repair causes Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare childhood cancer
   predisposing syndrome. At least 15 genes are known to be mutated in FA;
   however, their role in DNA repair remains unclear. Here, we show that
   the FANCJ helicase promotes DNA replication in trans by counteracting
   fork stalling on replication barriers, such as G4 quadruplex structures.
   Accordingly, stabilization of G4 quadruplexes in Delta FANCJ cells
   restricts fork movements, uncouples leading- and lagging-strand
   synthesis and generates small single-stranded DNA gaps behind the fork.
   Unexpectedly, we also discovered that FANCJ suppresses heterochromatin
   spreading by coupling fork movement through replication barriers with
   maintenance of chromatin structure. We propose that FANCJ plays an
   essential role in counteracting chromatin compaction associated with
   unscheduled replication fork stalling and restart, and suppresses
   tumorigenesis, at least partially, in this replication-specific manner.

TI Global analysis of SUMO chain function reveals multiple roles in
   chromatin regulation
SO JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB Like ubiquitin, the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins can
   form oligomeric "chains," but the biological functions of these
   superstructures are not well understood. Here, we created mutant yeast
   strains unable to synthesize SUMO chains (smt3(allR)) and subjected them
   to high-content microscopic screening, synthetic genetic array (SGA)
   analysis, and high-density transcript profiling to perform the first
   global analysis of SUMO chain function. This comprehensive assessment
   identified 144 proteins with altered localization or intensity in
   smt3(allR) cells, 149 synthetic genetic interactions, and 225 mRNA
   transcripts (primarily consisting of stress-and nutrient-response genes)
   that displayed a >1.5-fold increase in expression levels. This
   information-rich resource strongly implicates SUMO chains in the
   regulation of chromatin. Indeed, using several different approaches, we
   demonstrate that SUMO chains are required for the maintenance of normal
   higher-order chromatin structure and transcriptional repression of
   environmental stress response genes in budding yeast.

TI Involvement of rat organic cation transporter 2 in the renal uptake of
   jatrorrhizine
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB Jatrorrhizine is a protoberberine alkaloid derived from Coptis chinensis
   concentrated extremely in rat kidney. In the present study, the
   involvement of rat organic cation transporter 2 (rOCT2) in the renal
   uptake of jatrorrhizine in rat was investigated through in vitro and in
   vivo experiments. Saturable and nonsaturable uptakes of jatrorrhizine
   were observed in rat kidney slices and rOCT2MadinDarby canine kidney
   (MDCK) cells. MichaelisMenten constants of 677.8 and 21.0 mu M, maximum
   uptake rate of 123 (pmol/min)/mg kidney and 13.7 (pmol/min)/mg protein,
   and nonsaturable uptake clearance of 0.054 (mu L/min)/mg kidney and
   0.032 (mu L/min)/mg protein were observed in rat kidney slices and
   rOCT2MDCK cells, respectively. As inhibitors of rOCT2, corticosterone,
   verapamil, and cimetidine can inhibit jatrorrhizine uptake in rat kidney
   slices and rOCT2MDCK cells. Their median inhibitory concentration in rat
   kidney slices was 7, 78, and 538 mu M, whereas that in rOCT2MDCK cells
   was 1.07, 86.5, and 151.8 mu M. Coadministration with 20 mg/kg
   corticosterone, a selective inhibitor of rOCT2, reduced the
   jatrorrhizine concentration in the cortex and medulla in the in vivo
   experiment. Thus, rOCT2 is mainly responsible for the renal uptake of
   jatrorrhizine in rat and in the regulation of jatrorrhizine
   concentration in the kidney. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

TI Efficient neocentromere formation is suppressed by gene conversion to
   maintain centromere function at native physical chromosomal loci in
   Candida albicans
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB CENPA/Cse4 assembles centromeric chromatin on diverse DNA. CENPA
   chromatin is epigenetically propagated on unique and different
   centromere DNA sequences in a pathogenic yeast Candida albicans.
   Formation of neocentromeres on DNA, nonhomologous to native centromeres,
   indicates a role of non-DNA sequence determinants in CENPA deposition.
   Neocentromeres have been shown to form at multiple loci in C. albicans
   when a native centromere was deleted. However, the process of site
   selection for CENPA deposition on native or neocentromeres in the
   absence of defined DNA sequences remains elusive. By systematic deletion
   of CENPA chromatin-containing regions of variable length of different
   chromosomes, followed by mapping of neocentromere loci in C. albicans
   and its related species Candida dubliniensis, which share similar
   centromere properties, we demonstrate that the chromosomal location is
   an evolutionarily conserved primary determinant of CENPA deposition.
   Neocentromeres on the altered chromosome are always formed close to the
   site which was once occupied by the native centromere. Interestingly,
   repositioning of CENPA chromatin from the neocentromere to the native
   centromere occurs by gene conversion in C. albicans.

SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB Environmental compounds have been shown to promote epigenetic
   transgenerational inheritance of disease. The current study was designed
   to determine if a hydrocarbon mixture involving jet fuel (JP-8) promotes
   epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. Gestating F0
   generation female rats were transiently exposed during the fetal gonadal
   development period. The direct exposure F1 generation had an increased
   incidence of kidney abnormalities in both females and males, prostate
   and pubertal abnormalities in males, and primordial follicle loss and
   polycystic ovarian disease in females. The first transgenerational
   generation is the F3 generation, and the jet fuel lineage had an
   increased incidence of primordial follicle loss and polycystic ovarian
   disease in females, and obesity in both females and males. Analysis of
   the jet fuel lineage F3 generation sperm epigenome identified 33
   differential DNA methylation regions, termed epimutations. Observations
   demonstrate hydrocarbons can promote epigenetic transgenerational
   inheritance of disease and sperm epimutations, potential biomarkers for
   ancestral exposures. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Functional coupling of TRPC2 cation channels and the calcium-activated
   anion channels in rat thyroid cells: Implications for iodide homeostasis
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB The initial step in a synthesis of thyroid hormones is the uptake of
   iodide from the circulation. Iodide (I-) is transported into thyroid
   cells via a Na+/I- symporter (NIS), which is electrogenic and thus
   sensitive to alterations in membrane potential (Vm). I- is then released
   to the lumen of thyroid follicles where the hormones are synthesised and
   stored. The mechanisms of I- release to follicle lumen are poorly
   characterised. Our whole-cell voltage clamp recordings revealed the
   presence of a Ca2+ activated Cl- current (CaCC) in Fisher rat thyroid
   cell line 5 (FRTL-5). Transcripts of anoctamin 1 (ANO1) and anoctamin 10
   (ANO10), putative molecular constituents of CaCC, were detected. The
   anion channels underlying CaCC are highly permeable to I-. Both niflumic
   acid (NFA) and 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), antagonists of
   CaCC and transient receptor potential channels, respectively, inhibited
   CaCC. Canonical transient receptor potential channel 2 (TRPC2) is the
   only TRPC member present in FRTL-5 cells. The activation rate of CaCC
   was markedly slower in shTRPC2 knock-down cells, indicating that Ca2+
   entry via TRPC2 contributes to CaCC activation. The uptake of iodide was
   enhanced and the resting Vm was more depolarised in TRPC2 knock-down
   cells. We suggest that the interplay between TRPC2 and ANO1 may have
   dual effects on iodide transport, modulating I- release via ANO channels
   and I- uptake via the Vm sensitive NIS. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 814823,

TI Lysine methyltransferase Smyd2 regulates Hsp90-mediated protection of
   the sarcomeric titin springs and cardiac function
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH
AB Protein lysine methylation controls gene expression and repair of
   deoxyribonucleic acid in the nucleus but also occurs in the cytoplasm,
   where the role of this posttranslational modification is less
   understood. Members of the Smyd protein family of lysine
   methyltransferases are particularly abundant in the cytoplasm, with
   Smyd1 and Smyd2 being most highly expressed in the heart and in skeletal
   muscles. Smyd1 is a crucial myogenic regulator with histone
   methyltransferase activity but also associates with myosin, which
   promotes sarcomere assembly. Smyd2 methylates histones and non-histone
   proteins, such as the tumor suppressors, p53 and retinoblastoma protein,
   RB. Smyd2 has an intriguing function in the cytoplasm of skeletal
   myocytes, where it methylates the chaperone Hsp90, thus promoting the
   interaction of a Smyd2-methyl-Hsp90 complex with the N2A-domain of
   titin. This complex protects the sarcomeric I-band region and myocyte
   organization. We briefly summarize some novel functions of Smyd family
   members, with a focus on Smyd2, and highlight their role in striated
   muscles and cytoplasmic actions. We then provide experimental evidence
   that Smyd2 is also important for cardiac function. In the cytoplasm of
   cardiomyocytes, Smyd2 was found to associate with the sarcomeric I-band
   region at the titin N2A-domain. Binding to N2A occurred in vitro and in
   yeast via N-terminal and extreme C-terminal regions of Smyd2.
   Smyd2-knockdown in zebrafish using an antisense oligonucleotide
   morpholino approach strongly impaired cardiac performance. We conclude
   that Smyd2 and presumably several other Smyd family members are lysine
   methyltransferases which have, next to their nuclear activity, specific
   regulatory functions in the cytoplasm of heart and skeletal muscle
   cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cardiomyocyte

TI Regulation of AMPA receptor surface trafficking and synaptic plasticity
   by a cognitive enhancer and antidepressant molecule
SO MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB The plasticity of excitatory synapses is an essential brain process
   involved in cognitive functions, and dysfunctions of such adaptations
   have been linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression. Although
   the intracellular cascades that are altered in models of depression and
   stress-related disorders have been under considerable scrutiny, the
   molecular interplay between antidepressants and glutamatergic signaling
   remains elusive. Using a combination of electrophysiological and single
   nanoparticle tracking approaches, we here report that the cognitive
   enhancer and antidepressant tianeptine (S 1574, [3-chloro-6-methyl-5,
   5-dioxo-6,11-dihydro-(c,f)-dibenzo-(1,2-thiazepine)-11-yl) amino]-7
   heptanoic acid, sodium salt) favors synaptic plasticity in hippocampal
   neurons both under basal conditions and after acute stress. Strikingly,
   tianeptine rapidly reduces the surface diffusion of AMPA receptor
   (AMPAR) through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
   (CaMKII)-dependent mechanism that enhances the binding of AMPAR
   auxiliary subunit stargazin with PSD-95. This prevents
   corticosterone-induced AMPAR surface dispersal and restores long-term
   potentiation of acutely stressed mice. Collectively, these data provide
   the first evidence that a therapeutically used drug targets the surface
   diffusion of AMPAR through a CaMKII-stargazin-PSD-95 pathway, to promote
   long-term synaptic plasticity. Molecular Psychiatry (2013) 18, 471-484;

TI Chromatin Collapse during Caspase-dependent Apoptotic Cell Death
   Requires DNA Fragmentation Factor, 40-kDa Subunit-/Caspase-activated
   Deoxyribonuclease-mediated 3 '-OH Single-strand DNA Breaks
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Apoptotic nuclear morphology and oligonucleosomal double-strand DNA
   fragments (also known as DNA ladder) are considered the hallmarks of
   apoptotic cell death. From a classic point of view, these two processes
   occur concomitantly. Once activated, DNA fragmentation factor, 40-kDa
   subunit (DFF40)/caspase-activated DNase (CAD) endonuclease hydrolyzes
   the DNA into oligonucleosomal-size pieces, facilitating the chromatin
   package. However, the dogma that the apoptotic nuclear morphology
   depends on DNA fragmentation has been questioned. Here, we use different
   cellular models, including MEF CAD(-/-) cells, to unravel the mechanism
   by which DFF40/CAD influences chromatin condensation and nuclear
   collapse during apoptosis. Upon apoptotic insult, SK-N-AS cells display
   caspase-dependent apoptotic nuclear alterations in the absence of
   internucleosomal DNA degradation. The overexpression of a wild-type form
   of DFF40/CAD endonuclease, but not of different catalytic-null mutants,
   restores the cellular ability to degrade the chromatin into
   oligonucleosomal-length fragments. We show that apoptotic nuclear
   collapse requires a 3'-OH endonucleolytic activity even though the
   internucleosomal DNA degradation is impaired. Moreover, alkaline
   unwinding electrophoresis and In Situ End-Labeling (ISEL)/In Situ Nick
   Translation (ISNT) assays reveal that the apoptotic DNA damage observed
   in the DNA ladder-deficient SK-N-AS cells is characterized by the
   presence of single-strand nicks/breaks. Apoptotic single-strand breaks
   can be impaired by DFF40/CAD knockdown, abrogating nuclear collapse and
   disassembly. In conclusion, the highest order of chromatin compaction
   observed in the later steps of caspase-dependent apoptosis relies on
   DFF40/CAD-mediated DNA damage by generating 3'-OH ends in single-strand
   rather than double-strand DNA nicks/breaks.

TI High Resolution Methylome Analysis Reveals Widespread Functional
   Hypomethylation during Adult Human Erythropoiesis
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells to red cells requires
   coordinated expression of numerous erythroid genes and is characterized
   by nuclear condensation and extrusion during terminal development. To
   understand the regulatory mechanisms governing these widespread
   phenotypic changes, we conducted a high resolution methylomic and
   transcriptomic analysis of six major stages of human erythroid
   differentiation. We observed widespread epigenetic differences between
   early and late stages of erythropoiesis with progressive loss of
   methylation being the dominant change during differentiation. Gene
   bodies, intergenic regions, and CpG shores were preferentially
   demethylated during erythropoiesis. Epigenetic changes at transcription
   factor binding sites correlated significantly with changes in gene
   expression and were enriched for binding motifs for SCL, MYB, GATA, and
   other factors not previously implicated in erythropoiesis. Demethylation
   at gene promoters was associated with increased expression of genes,
   whereas epigenetic changes at gene bodies correlated inversely with gene
   expression. Important gene networks encoding erythrocyte membrane
   proteins, surface receptors, and heme synthesis proteins were found to
   be regulated by DNA methylation. Furthermore, integrative analysis
   enabled us to identify novel, potential regulatory areas of the genome
   as evident by epigenetic changes in a predicted PU.1 binding site in
   intron 1 of the GATA1 gene. This intronic site was found to be conserved
   across species and was validated to be a novel PU.1 binding site by
   quantitative ChIP in erythroid cells. Altogether, our study provides a
   comprehensive analysis of methylomic and transcriptomic changes during
   erythroid differentiation and demonstrates that human terminal
   erythropoiesis is surprisingly associated with hypomethylation of the
   genome.

TI Species-specific lipophilicity of thyroid hormones and their precursors
   in view of their membrane transport properties
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB A total of 30 species-specific partition coefficients of three thyroid
   hormones (thyroxine, liothyronine, reverse liothyronine) and their two
   biological precursors (monoiodotyrosine, diiodotyrosine) are presented.
   The molecules were studied using combined methods of microspeciation and
   lipophilicity. Microspeciation was carried out by (1)H NMR-pH and UV-pH
   titration techniques on the title compounds and their auxiliary
   derivatives of reduced complexity. Partition of some of the individual
   microspecies was mimicked by model compounds of the closest possible
   similarity, then correction factors were determined and introduced. Our
   data show that the iodinated aromatic ring system is the definitive
   structural element that fundamentally determines the lipophilicity of
   thyroid hormones, whereas the protonation state of the aliphatic part
   plays a role of secondary importance. On the other hand, the
   lipophilicity of the precursors is highly influenced by the protonation
   state due to the relative lack of overwhelmingly lipophilic moieties.
   The different log p values of the positional isomers liothyronine and
   reverse liothyronine represent the importance of steric and electronic
   factors in lipophilicity. Our investigations provided clear indication
   that overall partition, the best membrane transport - predicting
   physico-chemical parameter depends collectively on the site-specific
   basicity and species-specific partition coefficient. At physiological pH
   these biomolecules are strongly amphipathic due to the lipophilic
   aromatic rings and hydrophilic amino acid side chains which can well be
   the reason why thyroid hormones cannot cross membranes by passive
   diffusion and they are constituents of biological membranes.
   The lipophilicity profile of thyroid hormones and their precursors are
   calculated and depicted in terms of species-specific lipophilicities
   over the entire pH range. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanisms Regulating Mercury Bioavailability for Methylating
   Microorganisms in the Aquatic Environment: A Critical Review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Mercury is a potent neurotoxin for humans, particularly if the metal is
   in the form of methylmercury. Mercury is widely distributed in aquatic
   ecosystems as a result of anthropogenic activities and natural earth
   processes. A first step toward bioaccumulation of methylmercury in
   aquatic food webs is the methylation of inorganic forms of the metal, a
   process that is primarily mediated by anaerobic bacteria. In this
   Review, we evaluate the current state of knowledge regarding the
   mechanisms regulating microbial mercury methylation, including the
   speciation of mercury in environments where methylation occurs and the
   processes that control mercury bioavailability to these organisms.
   Methylmercury production rates are generally related to the presence and
   productivity of methylating bacteria and also the uptake of inorganic
   mercury to these microorganisms. Our understanding of the mechanisms
   behind methylation is limited due to fundamental questions related to
   the geochemical forms of mercury that persist in anoxic settings, the
   mode of uptake by methylating bacteria, and the biochemical pathway by
   which these microorganisms produce and degrade methylmercury. In anoxic
   sediments and water, the geochemical forms of mercury (and subsequent
   bioavailability) are largely governed by reactions between Hg(II),
   inorganic sulfides, and natural organic matter. These interactions
   result in a mixture of dissolved, nanoparticulate, and larger
   crystalline particles that cannot be adequately represented by
   conventional chemical equilibrium models for Hg bioavailability. We
   discuss recent advances in nanogeochemistry and environmental
   microbiology that can provide new tools and unique perspectives to help
   us solve the question of how microorganisms methylate mercury. An
   understanding of the factors that cause the production and degradation
   of methylmercury in the environment is ultimately needed to inform
   policy makers and develop long-term strategies for controlling mercury
   contamination.

TI An endogene-resembling transgene delays the onset of silencing and

   than endogenes are. In this study, we generated a transgene that
   structurally mimicks an endogene. It is composed of endogenous promoter,
   5'-UTR, introns, 3'-UTR and terminator elements. Our data revealed that,
   in contrast to a conventional transgene, an endogene-resembling
   transgene was more stably expressed and poorly processed into small
   RNAs. In addition, although both constructs triggered methylation of
   homologous DNA sequences at similar levels, the endogene-resembling

   several unique amino acids compared to motifs of other CCoAOMT-like

TI Effects of kisspeptin-13 on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
   thermoregulation, anxiety and locomotor activity in rats
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Kisspeptin is a mammalian amidated neurohormone, which belongs to the
   RF-amide peptide family and is known for its key role in reproduction.
   However, in contrast with the related members of the RF-amide family,
   little information is available regarding its role in the
   stress-response. With regard to the recent data suggesting kisspeptin
   neuronal projections to the paraventricular nucleus, in the present
   experiments we investigated the effect of kisspeptin-13 (KP-13), an
   endogenous derivative of kisspeptin, on the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, motor behavior and
   thermoregulatory function. The peptide was administered
   intracerebroventricularly (icy.) in different doses (0.5-2 mu g) to
   adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, the behavior of which was then observed
   by means of telemetry, open field and elevated plus maze tests.
   Additionally, plasma concentrations of corticosterone were measured in
   order to assess the influence of KP-13 on the HPA system. The effects on
   core temperature were monitored continuously via telemetry. The results
   demonstrated that KP-13 stimulated the horizontal locomotion (square
   crossing) in the open field test and decreased the number of entries
   into and the time spent in the open arms during the elevated plus maze
   tests. The peptide also caused marked elevations in the spontaneous
   locomotor activity and the core temperature recorded by the telemetric
   system, and significantly increased the basal corticosterone level. In
   conclusion, our data indicate that icy. administered KP-13 stimulates
   the HPA axis, induces hyperthermia, activates motor behavior and causes
   anxiety in rats. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Prenatal Enriched Environment improves emotional and attentional
   reactivity to adulthood stress
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Environmental factors seem to play a key role in brain and behavioral
   development, both in humans and animals. Different environmental
   manipulations, either pre- or post-natal, have been shown to exert
   long-term physiological and behavioral effects. While studies in the
   field of Enriched Environment mainly focus on the post weaning period
   and provide enrichment as a post adverse-experience manipulation, the
   preceding effects of prenatal Enriched Environment have rarely been
   investigated. In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal
   Enriched Environment (through the entire pregnancy) followed by
   adulthood acute stress. In the prenatal Enriched Environment offspring,
   we found anxiety and depressive-like behaviors with poor attentional
   performance. Surprisingly, when prenatal Enriched Environment was
   followed by adulthood stress, we observed a dramatic restoration of
   these behavioral deficits. Our results suggest that prenatal Enriched
   Environment may substrate resiliency to adulthood stress. (C) 2012

TI Myogenin Recruits the Histone Chaperone Facilitates Chromatin
   Transcription (FACT) to Promote Nucleosome Disassembly at
   Muscle-specific Genes
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) functions to reorganize
   nucleosomes by acting as a histone chaperone that destabilizes and
   restores nucleosomal structure. The FACT complex is composed of two
   subunits: SSRP1 and SPT16. We have discovered that myogenin interacts
   with the FACT complex. Transfection of FACT subunits with myogenin is
   highly stimulatory for endogenous muscle gene expression in 10T1/2
   cells. We have also found that FACT subunits do not associate with
   differentiation-specific genes while C2C12 cells are proliferating but
   are recruited to muscle-specific genes as differentiation initiates and
   then dissociate as differentiation proceeds. The recruitment is
   dependent on myogenin, as knockdowns of myogenin show no recruitment of
   the FACT complex. These data suggest that FACT is involved in the early
   steps of gene activation through its histone chaperone activities that
   serve to open the chromatin structure and facilitate transcription.
   Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that nucleosomes are depleted
   at muscle-specific promoters upon differentiation and that this activity
   is dependent on the presence of FACT. Our results show that the FACT
   complex promotes myogenin-dependent transcription and suggest that FACT
   plays an important role in the establishment of the appropriate
   transcription profile in a differentiated muscle cell.

TI Widespread resetting of DNA methylation in glioblastoma-initiating cells
   suppresses malignant cellular behavior in a lineage-dependent manner
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB Epigenetic changes are frequently observed in cancer. However, their
   role in establishing or sustaining the malignant state has been
   difficult to determine due to the lack of experimental tools that enable
   resetting of epigenetic abnormalities. To address this, we applied
   induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming techniques to invoke
   widespread epigenetic resetting of glioblastoma (GBM)-derived neural
   stem (GNS) cells. GBM iPSCs (GiPSCs) were subsequently redifferentiated
   to the neural lineage to assess the impact of cancer-specific epigenetic
   abnormalities on tumorigenicity. GiPSCs and their differentiating
   derivatives display widespread resetting of common GBM-associated
   changes, such as DNA hypermethylation of promoter regions of the cell
   motility regulator TES (testis-derived transcript), the tumor suppressor
   cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C; p57KIP2), and many
   polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) target genes (e.g., SFRP2).
   Surprisingly, despite such global epigenetic reconfiguration,
   GiPSC-derived neural progenitors remained highly malignant upon
   xenotransplantation. Only when GiPSCs were directed to nonneural cell
   types did we observe sustained expression of reactivated tumor
   suppressors and reduced infiltrative behavior. These data suggest that
   imposing an epigenome associated with an alternative developmental
   lineage can suppress malignant behavior. However, in the context of the
   neural lineage, widespread resetting of GBM-associated epigenetic
   abnormalities is not sufficient to override the cancer genome.

TI A label-free electrochemical assay for methyltransferase activity
   detection based on the controllable assembly of single wall carbon
   nanotubes
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB A sensitive label-free "signal-on" electrochemical approach for
   detection of methyltransferases (MTase) activity is developed based on
   the signal transduction and amplification of single wall carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs). In this method, the oligonucleotide I is first
   self-assembled on the electrode via Au-S bonding. After hybridization
   with its complement ssDNA (oligonucleotide II), duplex strand DNA
   (dsDNA) probes containing specific recognition sequence of Dam MTase and
   methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease Dpn I is then formed on
   the electrode. In the presence of Dam MTase and Dpn I, the dsDNA probes
   are methylated and subsequently cleaved into two dsDNA fragments. After
   heating, the remained dsDNA fragments on the electrode melted into ssDNA
   fragments. Then the SWCNTs can be controllably assembled on the ssDNA
   fragments remained on the electrode, mediating efficient electron
   transfer between the electrode and electroactive species. It generates
   measurable current signal (eT ON), which is related to the concentration
   of the Dam MTase. The resulting change in electron transfer efficiency
   is readily measured by differential pulse voltammetry at Dam MTase
   concentrations as low as 0.04 U/mL. This method does not need
   electroactive molecules labeling on the methylation-responsive DNA
   probes. The linear response of the developed facile signal-on
   electrochemical sensing system for Dam MTase is in the range of 0.1-1.0
   U/mL. In addition, such a SWCNTs based electrochemical assay also has
   the ability to screen inhibitors for Dam MTase. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Chromatin Remodeling at DNA Double-Strand Breaks
SO CELL
AB DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can arise from multiple sources,

TI Enzyme-Promoted Base Flipping Controls DNA Methylation Fidelity
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB A quantitative understanding of how conformational transitions
   contribute to enzyme catalysis and specificity remains a fundamental
   challenge. A suite of biophysical approaches was used to reveal several
   transient states of the enzyme substrate complexes of the model DNA
   cytosine methyltransferase M.HhaI. Multidimensional, transverse
   relaxation-optimized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments show
   that M.Hhal has the same conformation with noncognate and cognate DNA
   sequences. The high-affinity cognatelike mode requires the formation of
   a subset of protein-DNA interactions that drive the flipping of the
   target base from the helix to the active site. Noncognate substrates
   lacking these interactions undergo slow base flipping, and fluorescence
   tracking of the catalytic loop corroborates the NMR evidence of a loose,
   nonspecific binding mode prior to base flipping and subsequent closure
   of the catalytic loop. This slow flipping transition defines the
   rate-limiting step for the methylation of noncognate sequences.
   Additionally, we present spectroscopic evidence of an intermediate along
   the base flipping pathway that has been predicted but never previously
   observed. These findings provide important details of how conformational
   rearrangements are used to balance specificity with catalytic
   efficiency.

TI Hypomethylation of the LEP gene in placenta and elevated maternal leptin
   concentration in early onset pre-eclampsia
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB In pre-eclampsia, placental leptin is up-regulated and leptin is
   elevated in maternal plasma. To investigate potential epigenetic
   regulation of the leptin (LEP) gene in normal and complicated pregnancy,
   DNA methylation was assessed at multiple reported regulatory regions in
   placentae from control pregnancies (n = 111), and those complicated by
   early onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET; arising <34 weeks; n = 19), late onset
   pre-eclampsia (LOPET; arising >= 34 weeks; n = 18) and normotensive
   intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR; n = 13). The LEP promoter was
   hypomethylated in EOPET, but not LOPET or nIUGR placentae, particularly
   at CpG sites downstream of the transcription start site (-10.1%; P <
   0.0001). Maternal plasma leptin was elevated in EOPET and LOPET (P <
   0.05), but not nIUGR, compared with controls. EOPET cases showed a trend
   towards biallelic LEP expression rather than skewed allelic expression
   observed in control placentae, suggesting that loss of normal
   monoallelic expression at the LEP locus is associated with
   hypomethylation, leading to increased overall LEP expression. (C) 2012

TI Phospho Switch Triggers Brd4 Chromatin Binding and Activator Recruitment
   for Gene-Specific Targeting
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) is an epigenetic reader and
   transcriptional regulator recently identified as a cancer therapeutic
   target for acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Burkitt's
   lymphoma. Although chromatin targeting is a crucial function of Brd4,
   there is little understanding of how bromodomains that bind acetylated
   histones are regulated, nor how the gene-specific activity of Brd4 is
   determined. Via interaction screen and domain mapping, we identified p53
   as a functional partner of Brd4. Interestingly, Brd4 association with
   p53 is modulated by casein kinase II (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a
   conserved acidic region in Brd4 that selectively contacts either a
   juxtaposed bromodomain or an adjacent basic region to dictate the
   ability of Brd4 binding to chromatin and also the recruitment of p53 to
   regulated promoters. The unmasking of bromodomains and activator
   recruitment, concurrently triggered by the CK2 phospho switch, provide
   an intriguing mechanism for gene-specific targeting by a universal
   epigenetic reader.

TI Spinal Efference Copy Signaling and Gaze Stabilization during Locomotion
   in Juvenile Xenopus Frogs
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB In swimming Xenopus laevis tadpoles, gaze stabilization is achieved by
   efference copies of spinal locomotory CPG output that produce rhythmic
   extraocular motor activity appropriate for minimizing motion-derived
   visual disturbances. During metamorphosis, Xenopus switches its
   locomotory mechanism from larval tail-based undulatory movements to
   bilaterally synchronous hindlimb kick propulsion in the adult. The
   change in locomotory mode leads to body motion dynamics that no longer
   require conjugate left-right eye rotations for effective retinal image
   stabilization. Using in vivo kinematic analyses, in vitro
   electrophysiological recordings and specific CNS lesions, we have
   investigated spino-extraocular motor coupling in the juvenile frog and
   the underlying neural pathways to understand how gaze control processes
   are altered in accordance with the animal's change in body plan and
   locomotor strategy. Recordings of extraocular and limb motor nerves
   during spontaneous "fictive" swimming in isolated CNS preparations
   revealed that there is indeed a corresponding change in spinal efference
   copy control of extraocular motor output. In contrast to fictive larval
   swimming where alternating bursts occur in bilateral antagonistic
   horizontal extraocular nerves, during adult fictive limb-kicking, these
   motor nerves are synchronously active in accordance with the production
   of convergent eye movements during the linear head accelerations
   resulting from forward propulsion. Correspondingly, the neural pathways
   mediating spino-extraocular coupling have switched from contralateral to
   strictly ipsilateral ascending influences that ensure a coactivation of
   bilateral extraocular motoneurons with synchronous left-right limb
   extensions. Thus, adaptive developmental plasticity during metamorphosis
   enables spinal CPG-driven extraocular motor activity to match the
   changing requirements for eye movement control during self-motion.

TI Heat stress in poultry and the beneficial effects of ascorbic acid
   (vitamin C) supplementation during periods of heat stress
SO WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Pakistan is an agro-livestock based economy with a poultry share of 55%
   of the total agricultural GDP (21%). The environment in Pakistan remains
   hot and humid during July to August, which renders the survival of
   poultry critical during these months, as birds are more susceptible to
   changing environments than other domestic animals. Heat stress is a
   combination of high environmental temperature and humidity, hindering
   proper thermoregulatory processes. It diminishes immunity, feed intake,
   weight gain, egg production, number of chicks per hen, hatchability of
   fertile eggs, egg and carcass quality, mineral balance, and increases
   panting and mortality and affects semen quality and fertility in male
   birds. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), a white crystalline compound (also
   known as L-ascorbic acid) is primarily synthesised in the chicken by the
   kidneys, however, during heat stress, endogenous ascorbic acid becomes
   insufficient to meet the bird's requirements. Vitamin C ameliorates heat
   stress induced problems such as poor immunity, feed intake, weight gain,
   oxidative stress, rectal and body temperature, fertility and semen
   quality, carcass weight and mortality in birds.

TI Direct progression of capsular invasive carcinomas from subcapsular
   focal hyperplasias induced by hypothyroidism-mediated tumor promotion in
   a rat two-stage thyroid carcinogenesis model
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Some goitrogens promote thyroid carcinogenesis in rats in an
   initiation-promotion model; this model frequently produces carcinomas
   that invade fibrously thickened capsules, termed capsular invasive
   carcinomas (CICs). The present study tested a hypothesis that CICs
   originate from parenchymal proliferative lesions located beneath the
   capsule.
   Cell proliferation activity, cell-cycle kinetics and cellular invasion
   were immunohistochemically examined in subcapsular proliferative lesions
   in male F344 rats treated with an anti-thyroid agent, propylthiouracil
   or sulfadimethoxine, during the tumor-promotion phase after initiation
   with N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine.
   Focal follicular cell hyperplasias (FFCHs) were the most commonly
   observed parenchymal proliferative lesions. Subcapsular FFCHs located
   near CICs showed more Ki-67(+) cells in the capsular side than the
   contrary parenchymal center side. Most of these FFCHs located near CICs
   showed accumulated immunoreactivity for cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E and
   cyclin-dependent kinase-2, whereas most subcapsular FFCHs located
   elsewhere did not show such accumulated expression of cell-cycle
   molecules. Subcapsular FFCHs immunoreactive at the capsular front for
   tenascin-C, a tumor invasion marker of extracellular matrix protein,
   showed high proliferation activity.
   Subcapsular FFCH-forming cells can potentially spread directly into the
   fibrously thickened capsule to form CICs by accelerating cell-cycle
   activity.

TI Advances in biotechnology and informatics to link variation in the

SO FUNCTIONAL & INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS
AB Advances in our understanding of genome structure provide consistent
   evidence for the existence of a core genome representing species
   classically defined by phenotype, as well as conditionally dispensable
   components of the genome that shows extensive variation between
   individuals of a given species. Generally, conservation of phenotypic
   features between species reflects conserved features of the genome;
   however, this is evidently not necessarily always the case as

   In both plants and animals, the methylation activity of DNA and histones
   continues to present new variables for modifying (eventually) the
   phenotype of an organism and provides for structural variation that
   builds on the point mutations, rearrangements, indels, and amplification
   of retrotransposable elements traditionally considered. The translation
   of the advances in the structure/function analysis of the genome to

TI Silencing of xylose isomerase and cellulose synthase by siRNA inhibits

SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB A key challenge in the successful treatment of Acanthamoeba infections
   is its ability to transform into a dormant cyst form that is resistant
   to physiological conditions and pharmacological therapies, resulting in
   recurrent infections. The carbohydrate linkage analysis of cyst walls of
   Acanthamoeba castellanii showed variously linked sugar residues,
   including xylofuranose/xylopyranose, glucopyranose, mannopyranose, and
   galactopyranose. Here, it is shown that exogenous xylose significantly
   reduced A. castellanii differentiation in encystation assays (P < 0.05
   using paired t test, one-tailed distribution). Using small interfering
   RNA (siRNA) probes against xylose isomerase and cellulose synthase, as
   well as specific inhibitors, the findings revealed that xylose isomerase
   and cellulose synthase activities are crucial in the differentiation of
   A. castellanii. Inhibition of both enzymes using siRNA against xylose
   isomerase and cellulose synthase but not scrambled siRNA attenuated A.
   castellanii metamorphosis, as demonstrated by the arrest of encystation
   of A. castellanii. Neither inhibitor nor siRNA probes had any effect on

TI Mutant p53 binds to estrogen receptor negative promoter via DNMT1 and
   HDAC1 in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two epigenetic mechanisms
   involved in the lack of estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Our previous
   studies demonstrated that mutant p53 along with repression complex
   proteins including DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2 is associated with ER-negative
   promoter in MDA-MB-468 cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of
   estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene silencing in these cells, we
   down-regulated DNMT1 and HDAC1 expression using siRNAs and studied the
   ability of DNMT1, HDAC1, MeCP2 and p53 in binding to ESR1 promoter CpG
   island. Our results showed that DNMT1 or HDAC1 down-regulation
   disassembled the repression complex proteins and mutant p53 from
   ER-negative promoter. The partial demethylation of ESR1 promoter and ER
   re-expression in down-regulated cells supports these findings. In vivo
   binding studies demonstrated that mutation of p53 protein in this cell
   line did not affect its binding capacity to DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2
   proteins. Our observations suggest that not only histone deacetylase
   activity of HDAC1 contributes to inactivation of methylated ESR1 gene
   but also HDAC1 presence on ESR1 promoter is important for assembly of
   DNMT1 in repression complex. In addition, our data revealed that mutant
   p53 protein binds to the promoter of ESR1 through direct interaction
   with HDAC1 and indirect interaction with DNMT1, MeCP2 proteins in the
   ER-negative MDA-MB-468 cells.

TI High-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation for genome-wide mapping of
   in vivo protein-DNA interactions and epigenomic states
SO NATURE PROTOCOLS
AB Dynamic protein binding to DNA elements regulates genome function and
   cell fate. Although methods for mapping in vivo protein-DNA interactions
   are becoming crucial for every aspect of genomic research, they are
   laborious and costly, thereby limiting progress. Here we present a
   protocol for mapping in vivo protein-DNA interactions using a
   high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation (HT-ChIP) approach. By
   using paramagnetic beads, we streamline the entire ChIP and indexed
   library construction process: sample transfer and loss is minimized and
   the need for manually labor-intensive procedures such as washes, gel
   extraction and DNA precipitation is eliminated. All of this allows for
   fully automated, cost effective and highly sensitive 96-well ChIP
   sequencing (ChIP-seq). Sample preparation takes 3 d from cultured cells
   to pooled libraries. Compared with previous methods, HT-ChIP is more
   suitable for large-scale in vivo studies, specifically those measuring
   the dynamics of a large number of different chromatin
   modifications/transcription factors or multiple perturbations.

TI Transient Neonatal Diabetes, ZFP57, and Hypomethylation of Multiple
   Imprinted Loci A detailed follow-up
SO DIABETES CARE
AB OBJECTIVE-Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus 1 (TNDM1) is the most
   common cause of diabetes presenting at birth. Approximately 5% of the
   cases are due to recessive ZFP57 mutations, causing hypomethylation at
   the TNDM locus and other imprinted loci (HIL). This has consequences for
   patient care because it has impact on the phenotype and recurrence risk
   for families. We have determined the genotype, phenotype, and
   epigenotype of the first 10 families to alert health professionals to
   this newly described genetic subgroup of diabetes.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-The 10 families (14 homozygous/compound
   heterozygous individuals) with ZFP57 mutations were ascertained through
   TNDM1 diagnostic testing. ZFP57 was sequenced in probands and their
   relatives, and the methylation levels at multiple maternally and
   paternally imprinted loci were determined. Medical and family histories
   were obtained, and clinical examination was performed.
   RESULTS-The key clinical features in probands were transient neonatal
   diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, macroglossia, heart defects,
   and developmental delay. However, the finding of two homozygous
   relatives without diabetes and normal intelligence showed that the
   phenotype could be very variable. The epigenotype always included total
   loss of methylation at the TNDM1 locus and reproducible combinations of
   differential hypomethylation at other maternally imprinted loci,
   including tissue mosaicism.
   CONCLUSIONS-There is yet no clear genotype-epigenotype-phenotype
   correlation to explain the variable clinical presentation, and this
   results in difficulties predicting the prognosis of affected
   individuals. However, many cases have a more severe phenotype than seen
   in other causes of TNDM1. Further cases and global epigenetic testing
   are needed to clarify this. Diabetes Care 36:505-512, 2013

TI Adrenalectomy amplifies aldosterone induced injury in cardiovascular
   tissue: An effect attenuated by adrenally derived steroids
SO STEROIDS
AB Aldosterone induces fibrotic changes in cardiovascular tissues but its
   effects have usually been demonstrated in models of pre-existing renal
   injury and/or hypertension. This study tests the hypothesis that
   aldosterone can directly induce vascular fibrotic changes in the absence
   of prior renal injury or hypertension. Experiments were conducted in
   intact or adrenalectomized (ADX) mice. Mice were divided into groups and
   treated for 1 week with vehicle or aldosterone (8 mu g/kg/day) +/-
   inhibitor (800 mu g/kg/day): CONTROLS, mice treated with aldosterone,
   ADX-CONTROLS, ADX + corticosterone (CURT 8 mu g/kg/day), ADX with
   aldosterone, ADX with aldosterone Plus the mineralocorticoid receptor
   (MR) antagonist RU-318, ADX with aldosterone + CURT (COAT inhibitor
   dose), and ADX with aldosterone + 11-dehydro-CORT. Aortic smooth muscle
   to collagen ratio, aorta intimal thickness (mu m), heart weight/body
   weight ratio (mg/gm), and left ventricular collagen (%) were measured.
   Prior to sacrifice, blood pressures were normal in all animals. Lower
   dose CURT alone had no effect on any of the variables examined.
   Aldosterone exposure was associated with extra-cellular matrix
   accumulation in cardiovascular tissues in intact mice and adrenalectomy
   exacerbated these effects. RU-318, CURT (inhibitor dose), and
   11-deydro-CORT each attenuated the early fibrotic changes induced by
   aldosterone. In the heart, aldosterone exposure affected all the
   parameters measured and caused intimal hypercellularity with monocytes
   adhering to endothelial cells lining coronary vessels. Cultured
   endothelial cells exposed to aldosterone (10 nM) released E-selectin,
   produced collagen, and promoted monocyte adhesion. These effects were
   inhibited by RU-318 and 11-deydro-CORT but not by COAT. Thus,
   adrenalectomy enhances aldosterone induced early fibrotic changes in
   heart and aorta. Aldosterone initially targets vascular endothelial
   cells. MR antagonists and 11-dehydro-CORT, an 11 beta-HSD dehydrogenase
   end-product, directly attenuate these effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Anterior gradient 2 and 3 - two prototype androgen-responsive genes
   transcriptionally upregulated by androgens and by oestrogens in prostate
   cancer cells
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB Androgens and oestrogens have been implicated in prostatic
   carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Although the actions of androgens
   have been studied extensively, the mechanisms underlying oestrogen
   signalling in prostate cancer are not fully understood. In the present
   study, we analyzed the effect of androgens and oestrogens on the
   expression of anterior gradient2 (AGR2) and anterior gradient3 (AGR3),
   comprising two highly-related genes encoding secretory proteins that are
   expressed in prostate cancer and one of which (AGR2) has been associated
   with tumour metastasis. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and
   western blot analysis showed androgen induction of AGR2 and AGR3 in
   three androgen receptor positive cell lines, starting at concentrations
   of 0.1nm. Both AGR genes were also transcriptionally activated by 5nm
   oestradiol but not by isotype selective or nonselective oestrogen
   receptor agonists in DUCaP cells that harbour a high-level of wild-type
   androgen receptor. A functional androgen receptor but not oestrogen
   receptor turned out to be required for both androgen and oestrogen
   regulation. This pattern of androgen and oestrogen regulation was
   confirmed in VCaP cells and was also observed for FKBP5, a
   well-characterized androgen-regulated gene. Genome-wide
   chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies coupled with deep sequencing
   identified androgen receptor binding sites localized in the distal
   promoter and intron regions of the AGR2 and AGR3 genes, respectively.
   The androgen responsiveness of these enhancers was verified by
   luciferase reporter gene assays and site-directed mutagenesis analysis.
   Androgen treatment also induced p300 and RNA PolII recruitment to
   androgen receptor enhancers of AGR2 and initiated local chromatin
   remodelling and the formation of RNA PolII-containing androgen receptor
   transcription complexes.

TI Promoter hypermethylation contributes to TIMP3 down-regulation in high
   stage endometrioid endometrial carcinomas
SO HISTOPATHOLOGY
AB Aims Expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) has
   been found to be decreased in several types of cancer by promoter gene
   hypermethylation. However, little is known regarding the silencing
   effect of TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation on gene and protein expression
   in endometrial carcinomas and its prognostic significance. Methods and
   results TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation and gene copy number variations
   were evaluated using a methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent
   probe amplification approach in 60 cases of endometrioid endometrial
   carcinomas. TIMP3 expression was also evaluated at the transcript and
   protein levels. Loss of TIMP-3 protein expression was found in 44 (73%)
   of 60 carcinomas. Promoter hypermethylation was identified in 25% (15 of
   60); was more frequent in stages IIIV (55%, six of 11) than in stage I
   (18%, nine of 49; P=0.021); and was found more commonly in tumours with
   deep myometrial invasion. MLH1 and TIMP3 promoters were hypermethylated
   simultaneously in the same group of tumours (P<0.001). A correlation
   between TIMP3 methylation and microsatellite instability (MSI) was found
   (P=0.005). TIMP3 copy number changes were frequently a loss (35%),
   whereas a gain was detected in only 5%. Conclusions TIMP3 promoter
   hypermethylation was associated with high stage endometrioid endometrial
   tumours with extrauterine spread. Nevertheless, promoter
   hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity are not the only mechanisms
   for TIMP3 inactivation.

AB In order to discover new inhibitors of the DNA methyltransferase 3A/3L
   complex, we used a medium-throughput nonradioactive screen on a random
   collection of 1120 small organic compounds. After a primary hit
   detection against DNA methylation activity of the murine Dnmt3A/3L
   catalytic complex, we further evaluated the EC50 of the 12 most potent
   hits as well as their cytotoxicity on DU145 prostate cancer cultured
   cells. Interestingly, most of the inhibitors showed low micromolar
   activities and little cytotoxicity. Dichlone, a small halogenated
   naphthoquinone, classically used as pesticide and fungicide, showed the
   lowest EC50 at 460 nM. We briefly assessed the selectivity of a subset
   of our new inhibitors against hDNMT1 and bacterial Dnmts, including M.
   SssI and EcoDam, and the protein lysine methyltransferase PKMT G9a and
   the mode of inhibition. Globally, the tested molecules showed a clear
   preference for the DNA methyltransferases, but poor selectivity among
   them. Two molecules including Dichlone efficiently reactivated YFP gene
   expression in a stable HEK293 cell line by promoter demethylation. Their
   efficacy was comparable to the DNMT inhibitor of reference
   5-azacytidine.

TI Long-term outcomes of unilateral orbital fat decompression for thyroid
   eye disease
SO GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes after
   unilateral orbital fat decompression in patients with thyroid eye
   disease.
   Retrospective, comparative, cross-sectional study
   Thirty-three orbits of 33 patients were included in this study. Of the
   33 patients, 13 underwent fat decompression (group A), and the other 20
   had bony decompression (group B).
   The medical records of patients who underwent orbital decompression to
   reduce proptosis for thyroid eye disease were retrospectively reviewed.
   The degrees of proptosis were measured by Hertel exophthalmometry
   preoperatively and over a follow-up period of more than 3 years. We
   evaluated the change in proptosis after surgery.
   Postoperative change in exophthalmos.
   A recurrence in proptosis from fat decompression was seen in ten
   patients (76.9 %) in group A and in only two patients (10 %) in group B.
   The amount of regression due to surgery after 3 years was 2.3 +/- 1.4 mm
   and 0.7 +/- 0.9 mm in groups A and B respectively. The tendency of
   regression was more prominent in group A than in group B.
   The long-term effect of unilateral orbital fat decompression for the
   reduction of proptosis in patients with thyroid eye disease may be weak,
   leading to regression. Care should be taken when determining the extent
   of fat decompression with consideration for this tendency.

TI Dynamic chromatin remodelling of ciliate macronuclear DNA as determined

   Paramecium tetraurelia
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB We report the detailed evaluation of crucial parameters for chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of macronuclear DNA in the unicellular
   eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia. Optimized parameters include
   crosslinking conditions, chromatin sonication and antibody titration
   thus providing a detailed protocol for successful ChIP in P.
   tetraurelia. As this ciliate is bacterivorous and RNAi by feeding
   represents a powerful tool for analysis of gene function, we moreover
   determined the effects of ingested nucleic acids by food bacteria.
   Feasibility of our protocol is demonstrated by characterisation of
   chromatin remodelling at promoters of cytosolic HSP70 isoforms during
   transcriptional activation under heat shock conditions by analyzing RNA
   abundance, nucleosome occupancy and levels of H3 lysine 9 acetylation.

TI H3K4 tri-methylation in synapsin genes leads to different expression
   patterns in bipolar disorder and major depression
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB The synapsin family of neuronal phosphoproteins is composed of three
   genes (SYN1, SYN2 and SYN3) with alternative splicing resulting in a
   number of variants with various levels of homology. These genes have
   been postulated to play significant roles in several neuropsychiatric
   disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and epilepsy.
   Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as histone modifications in gene
   regulatory regions, have also been proposed to play a role in a number
   of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and major
   depressive disorder. One of the best characterized histone modifications
   is histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), an epigenetic mark
   shown to be highly enriched at transcriptional start sites and
   associated with active transcription. In the present study we have
   quantified the expression of transcript variants of the three synapsin
   genes and investigated their relationship to H3K4me3 promoter enrichment
   in post-mortem brain samples. We found that histone modification marks
   were significantly increased in bipolar disorder and major depression
   and this effect was correlated with significant increases in gene
   expression. Our findings suggest that synapsin dysregulation in mood
   disorders is mediated in part by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.

TI Effects of Spectral Transmittance through Standard Laboratory Cages on
   Circadian Metabolism and Physiology in Nude Rats
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB Light is potent in circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral
   regulation, thereby having profound influence on the health and
   wellbeing of all mammals, including laboratory animals. We hypothesized
   that the spectral quality of light transmitted through colored compared
   with clear standard rodent cages alters circadian production of
   melatonin and temporal coordination of normal metabolic and physiologic
   activities. Female nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1(rnu); n = 6 per group) were
   maintained on a 12:12-h light:dark regimen (300 1x; lights on, 0600) in
   standard translucent clear, amber, or blue rodent cages; intensity and
   duration of lighting were identical for all groups. Rats were assessed
   for arterial blood levels of pO(2) and pCO(2), melatonin, total fatty
   acid, glucose, lactic acid, insulin, leptin, and corticosterone
   concentrations at 6 circadian time points. Normal circadian rhythms of
   arterial blood pO(2) and pCO(2) were different in rats housed in cages
   that were blue compared with amber or clear. Plasma melatonin levels
   (mean +/- SD)(2) were low (1.0 +/- 0.2 pg/mL) during the light phase in
   all groups but higher at nighttime in rats in blue cages (928.2 +/- 39.5
   pg/mL) compared with amber (256.8 +/- 6.6 pg/mL) and clear (154.8 +/-
   9.3 pg/mL) cages. Plasma daily rhythms of total fatty acid, glucose,
   lactic acid, leptin, insulin, and corticosterone were disrupted in rats
   housed in blue or amber compared with clear cages. Temporal coordination
   of circadian rhythms of physiology and metabolism can be altered
   markedly by changes in the spectral quality of light transmitted through
   colored standard rodent cages.

TI BRG1 promotes COUP-TFII expression and venous specification during
   embryonic vascular development
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Arteries and veins acquire distinct molecular identities prior to the
   onset of embryonic blood circulation, and their specification is crucial
   for vascular development. The transcription factor COUP-TFII currently
   functions at the top of a signaling pathway governing venous fate. It
   promotes venous identity by inhibiting Notch signaling and subsequent
   arterialization of endothelial cells, yet nothing is known about what
   regulates COUP-TFII expression in veins. We now report that the
   chromatin-remodeling enzyme BRG1 promotes COUP-TFII expression in venous
   endothelial cells during murine embryonic development. Conditional
   deletion of Brg1 from vascular endothelial cells resulted in
   downregulated COUP-TFII expression and aberrant expression of arterial
   markers on veins. BRG1 promotes COUP-TFII expression by binding
   conserved regulatory elements within the COUP-TFII promoter and
   remodeling chromatin to make the promoter accessible to transcriptional
   machinery. This study provides the first description of a factor
   promoting COUP-TFII expression in vascular endothelium and highlights a
   novel role for chromatin remodeling in venous specification.

TI The tiptop/teashirt genes regulate cell differentiation and renal
   physiology in Drosophila
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB The physiological activities of organs are underpinned by an interplay
   between the distinct cell types they contain. However, little is known
   about the genetic control of patterned cell differentiation during organ
   development. We show that the conserved Teashirt transcription factors
   are decisive for the differentiation of a subset of secretory cells,
   stellate cells, in Drosophila melanogaster renal tubules. Teashirt
   controls the expression of the water channel Drip, the chloride
   conductance channel CLC-a and the Leukokinin receptor (LKR), all of
   which characterise differentiated stellate cells and are required for
   primary urine production and responsiveness to diuretic stimuli.
   Teashirt also controls a dramatic transformation in cell morphology,
   from cuboidal to the eponymous stellate shape, during metamorphosis.
   teashirt interacts with cut, which encodes a transcription factor that
   underlies the differentiation of the primary, principal secretory cells,
   establishing a reciprocal negative-feedback loop that ensures the full
   differentiation of both cell types. Loss of teashirt leads to
   ineffective urine production, failure of homeostasis and premature
   lethality. Stellate cell-specific expression of the teashirt paralogue
   tiptop, which is not normally expressed in larval or adult stellate
   cells, almost completely rescues teashirt loss of expression from
   stellate cells. We demonstrate conservation in the expression of the
   family of tiptop/teashirt genes in lower insects and establish
   conservation in the targets of Teashirt transcription factors in mouse
   embryonic kidney.

TI Costs of growing up as a subordinate sibling are passed to the next
   generation in blue-footed boobies
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB As stresses in early development may generate costs in adult life,
   sibling competition and conflict in infancy are expected to diminish the
   reproductive value of surviving low-status members of broods and
   litters. We analysed delayed costs to blue-footed booby fledglings, Sula
   nebouxii, of junior status in the brood, which involves aggressive
   subordination, food deprivation and elevated corticosterone, but little
   or no deficit in size at fledging. In ten cohorts observed for up to
   16years, juniors showed no deficit in breeding success at any age,
   independent of lifespan, including in a sample of sibling pairs. Among
   females, juniors actually outreproduced seniors across the 16-year span.
   However, offspring produced by juniors in the first 3years of life were
   less likely to recruit into the breeding population than offspring of
   seniors. Since junior fledglings survive, recruit and compete as well as
   seniors (shown earlier), and breed as successfully as seniors across the
   lifespan, it appears the delayed cost of subordination is passed to
   offspring, and only to those few offspring produced in the first 3years
   of life. These correlational results indicate that systematic
   competition-related differences in developmental conditions of infant
   siblings can alter their reproductive value by affecting the viability
   of their eventual offspring.

TI Efficient RNA virus control in Drosophila requires the RNA
   methyltransferase Dnmt2
SO EMBO REPORTS
AB Drosophila use small-interfering RNA mechanisms to limit the
   amplification of viral genomes. However, it is unclear how small RNA
   interference components recognize and separate viral from cellular RNA.
   Dnmt2 enzymes are highly conserved RNA methyltransferases with substrate
   specificity towards cellular tRNAs. We report here that Dnmt2 is
   required for efficient innate immune responses in Drosophila. Dnmt2
   mutant flies accumulate increasing levels of Drosophila C virus and show
   activated innate immune responses. Binding of Dnmt2 to DCV RNA suggests
   that Dnmt2 contributes to virus control directly, possibly by RNA
   methylation. These observations demonstrate a role for Dnmt2 in
   antiviral defence.

TI Epigenetic disturbances in in vitro cultured gametes and embryos:
   implications for human assisted reproduction
SO FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB Although assisted reproductive technology (ART) has become a routine
   practice for human infertility treatment, the etiology of the increased
   risks for perinatal problems in ART-conceived children is still poorly
   understood. Data from mouse experiments and the in vitro production of
   livestock provide strong evidence that imprint establishment in late
   oocyte stages and reprogramming of the two germline genomes for somatic
   development after fertilization are vulnerable to environmental cues. In
   vitro culture and maturation of oocytes, superovulation, and embryo
   culture all represent artificial intrusions upon the natural
   development, which can be expected to influence the epigenome of the
   resultant offspring. However, in this context it is difficult to define
   the normal range of epigenetic variation in humans from conception
   throughout life. With the notable exception of a few highly penetrant
   imprinting mutations, the phenotypic consequences of any observed
   epigenetic differences between ART and non-ART groups remain largely
   unclear. The periconceptional period is not only critical for embryonal,
   placental, and fetal development, as well as the outcome at birth, but
   suboptimal in vitro culture conditions may also lead to persistent
   changes in the epigenome influencing disease susceptibilities later in
   life. The epigenome appears to be most plastic in the late stages of
   oocyte and the early stages of embryo development; this plasticity
   steadily decreases during prenatal and postnatal life. Therefore, when
   considering the safety of human ART from an epigenetic point of view,
   our main concern should not be whether or not a few rare imprinting
   disorders are increased, but rather we must be aware of a functional
   link between interference with epigenetic reprogramming in very early
   development and adult disease. (Fertil Steril (R) 2013;99:632-41. (C)

TI Cellular and molecular processes leading to embryo formation in sponges:
   evidences for high conservation of processes throughout animal evolution
SO DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION
AB The emergence of multicellularity is regarded as one of the major
   evolutionary events of life. This transition
   unicellularity/pluricellularity was acquired independently several times
   (King 2004). The acquisition of multicellularity implies the emergence
   of cellular cohesion and means of communication, as well as molecular
   mechanisms enabling the control of morphogenesis and body plan
   patterning. Some of these molecular tools seem to have predated the
   acquisition of multicellularity while others are regarded as the
   acquisition of specific lineages. Morphogenesis consists in the spatial
   migration of cells or cell layers during embryonic development,
   metamorphosis, asexual reproduction, growth, and regeneration, resulting
   in the formation and patterning of a body. In this paper, our aim is to
   review what is currently known concerning basal metazoans-sponges'
   morphogenesis from the tissular, cellular, and molecular points of
   view-and what remains to elucidate. Our review attempts to show that
   morphogenetic processes found in sponges are as diverse and complex as
   those found in other animals. In true epithelial sponges
   (Homoscleromorpha), as well as in others, we find similar cell/layer
   movements, cellular shape changes involved in major morphogenetic
   processes such as embryogenesis or larval metamorphosis. Thus, sponges
   can provide information enabling us to better understand early animal
   evolution at the molecular level but also at the cell/cell layer level.
   Indeed, comparison of molecular tools will only be of value if
   accompanied by functional data and expression studies during
   morphogenetic processes.

TI The effects of sex steroids on thyroid C cells and trabecular bone
   structure in the rat model of male osteoporosis
SO JOURNAL OF ANATOMY
AB Androgen deficiency is one of the major factors leading to the
   development of osteoporosis in men. Since calcitonin (CT) is a potent
   antiresorptive agent, in the present study we investigated the effects
   of androgen deficiency and subsequent testosterone and estradiol
   treatment on CT-producing thyroid C cells, skeletal and hormonal changes
   in middle-aged orchidectomized (Orx) rats. Fifteen-month-old male Wistar
   rats were either Orx or sham-operated (SO). One group of Orx rats
   received 5mg kg1 b.w. testosterone propionate (TP) subcutaneously, while
   another group was injected with 0.06mg kg1 b.w. estradiol dipropionate
   (EDP) once a day for 3weeks. A peroxidaseantiperoxidase method was
   applied for localization of CT in the C cells. The studies included
   ultrastructural microscopic observation of these cells. The metaphyseal
   region of the proximal tibia was measured histomorphometrically using an
   imagej public domain image processing program. TP or EDP treatment
   significantly increased C cell volume (Vc), volume densities (Vv) and
   serum CT concentration compared with the Orx animals. Administration of
   both TP and EDP significantly enhanced cancellous bone area (B.Ar),
   trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and trabecular number (Tb.N) and reduced
   trabecular separation (Tb.Sp). Serum osteocalcin (OC) and urinary Ca
   concentrations were significantly lower after these treatments in
   comparison with Orx rats. These data suggest that testosterone and
   estradiol treatment in Orx middle-aged rats affect calcitonin-producing
   thyroid C cells, which may contribute to the bone protective effects of
   sex hormones in the rat model of male osteoporosis.

TI Evaluation of Iodide Deficiency in the Lactating Rat and Pup Using a
   Biologically Based Dose-Response Model
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB A biologically based dose-response (BBDR) model for the
   hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid (HPT) axis in the lactating rat and
   nursing pup was developed to describe the perturbations caused by iodide
   deficiency on the HPT axis. Model calibrations, carried out by adjusting
   key model parameters, were used as a technique to evaluate HPT axis
   adaptations to dietary iodide intake in euthyroid (4.139 g iodide/day)
   and iodide-deficient (0.31 and 1.2 g iodide/day) conditions.
   Iodide-deficient conditions in both the dam and the pup were described
   with increased blood flow to the thyroid gland, TSH-mediated increase in
   thyroidal uptake of iodide and binding of iodide in the thyroid gland
   (organification), and, in general, reduced thyroid hormone production
   and metabolism. Alterations in thyroxine (T4) homeostasis were more
   apparent than for triiodothyronine (T3). Model-predicted average daily
   area-under-the-serum-concentration-curve (nM-day) values for T4 at
   steady state in the dam and pup decreased by 1415% for the 1.2 g
   iodide/day iodide-deficient diet and 4252% for the 0.31 g iodide/day
   iodide-deficient diet. In rat pups that were iodide deficient during
   gestation and lactation, these decreases in serum T4 levels were
   associated with declines in thyroid hormone in the fetal brain and a
   suppression of synaptic responses in the hippocampal region of the brain
   of the adult offspring (Gilbert et al., 2013).

TI Natural dispersal mechanisms and dispersal potential of the invasive
   ascidian Didemnum vexillum
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Over the past decade, several species of non-indigenous ascidians have
   had adverse effects on a range of coastal ecosystems, and associated
   industries like aquaculture. One such species, the colonial ascidian
   Didemnum vexillum, poses a threat to the highly-valued New Zealand
   green-lipped mussel industry, and there is interest in whether and to
   what extent its spread can be managed at a regional scale (< 100 km). An
   important component in the decision-making process for managing
   human-mediated pathways of spread is an understanding of D. vexillum's
   natural dispersal potential. Here we use a weight-of-evidence approach,
   combining laboratory and field studies, to assess the role of natural
   dispersal mechanisms in the spread of D. vexillum. Under laboratory
   conditions, > 70 % of D. vexillum larvae remained viable and were able
   to settle and undergo metamorphosis successfully following an artificial
   delay of 2 h. Larval viability decreased with increasing delay duration,
   although 10 % of larvae remained viable following a 36 h delay. A
   field-based study documented larval dispersal from two discrete source
   populations, with recruitment consistently detected on settlement plates
   at 250 m from source populations at one experimental site. Exponential
   decay models used to predict maximum larval dispersal distances at this
   site indicated that dispersal greater than 250 m is theoretically
   possible (> 1 km in some situations). That being so, we recognise that
   the successful establishment and persistence of populations will depend
   on a wide range of processes not taken into account here. Our findings
   are supported by surveillance of D. vexillum spread in the wider study
   region; there are a number of instances where the species established on
   artificial structures that were several kilometres from known source
   populations, at a time when intensive regional-scale management of
   anthropogenic vectors was underway. Collectively, our findings indicate
   that D. vexillum has the ability to spread further by natural dispersal
   than previously assumed; probably hundreds of metres to kilometres
   depending on the local hydrological conditions, which has important
   implications for the ongoing management of this pest species world-wide.

TI Chromatin Remodeling Defects in Pediatric and Young Adult Glioblastoma:
   A Tale of a Variant Histone 3 Tail
SO BRAIN PATHOLOGY
AB Primary brain tumors occur in 8 out of 100000 people and are the leading
   cause of cancer-related death in children. Among brain tumors,
   high-grade astrocytomas (HGAs) including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
   are aggressive and are lethal human cancers. Despite decades of
   concerted therapeutic efforts, HGAs remain essentially incurable in
   adults and children. Recent discoveries have revolutionized our
   understanding of these tumors in children and young adults. Recurrent
   somatic driver mutations in the tail of histone 3 variant 3 (H3.3),
   leading to amino acid substitutions at key residues, namely lysine (K)
   27 (K27M) and glycine 34 (G34R/G34V), were identified as a new molecular
   mechanism in pediatric GBM. These mutations represent the pediatric
   counterpart of the recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases
   (IDH) identified in young adult gliomas and provide a much-needed new
   pathway that can be targeted for therapeutic development. This review
   will provide an overview of the potential role of these mutations in
   altering chromatin structure and affecting specific molecular pathways
   ultimately leading to gliomagenesis. The distinct changes in chromatin
   structure and the specific downstream events induced by each mutation
   need characterizing independently if progress is to be made in tackling
   this devastating cancer.

TI Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma Presenting as a Massive Chest Wall Tumor
SO ENDOCRINE PATHOLOGY
AB The initial presentation of follicular thyroid carcinoma is rarely
   related to metastatic lesions. Presented here is the case of a
   70-year-old woman with the initial presentation of a 13-cm chest wall
   mass identified as a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma. The chest
   wall lesion had features of a poorly differentiated carcinoma with areas
   of necrosis, an insular growth pattern focally and increased mitotic
   activity. A small follicular carcinoma was subsequently identified. The
   primary tumor was a 1-cm well-differentiated follicular carcinoma with
   capsular and vascular invasion. This represents a rare presentation of a
   follicular thyroid carcinoma with initial recognition of a large,
   dedifferentiated metastatic lesion from a small primary carcinoma.
   Dedifferentiation and metastasis in the context of microcarcinoma is an
   exceptionally rare event and suggests other mechanisms may be involved
   in disease spread other than simply increased cell proliferation.

TI Decreased vitamin B12 availability induces ER stress through impaired
   SIRT1-deacetylation of HSF1
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a key determinant of S-adenosyl methionine
   (SAM)-dependent epigenomic cellular regulations related to
   methylation/acetylation and its deficiency produces neurodegenerative
   disorders by elusive mechanisms. Sirtuin 1 deacetylase (SIRT1) triggers
   cell response to nutritional stress through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
   stress. Recently, we have established a N1E115 dopaminergic cell model
   by stable expression of a transcobalamin-oleosin chimera (TO), which
   impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12, decreases methionine
   synthase activity and SAM level, and reduces cell proliferation. In
   contrast, oleosin-transcobalamin chimera (OT) does not modify the
   phenotype of transfected cells. Presently, the impaired cellular
   availability of vitamin B12 in TO cells activated irreversible ER stress
   pathways, with increased P-eIF-2 alpha, P-PERK, P-IRE1 alpha, ATF6,
   ATF4, decreased chaperon proteins and increased pro-apoptotic markers,
   CHOP and cleaved caspase 3, through reduced SIRT1 expression and
   consequently greater acetylation of heat-shock factor protein 1 (HSF1).
   Adding either B12, SIRT1, or HSF1 activators as well as overexpressing
   SIRT1 or HSF1 dramatically reduced the activation of ER stress pathways
   in TO cells. Conversely, impairing SIRT1 and HSF1 by siRNA, expressing a
   dominant negative form of HSF1, or adding a SIRT1 inhibitor led to
   B12-dependent ER stress in OT cells. Addition of B12 abolished the
   activation of stress transducers and apoptosis, and increased the
   expression of protein chaperons in OT cells subjected to thapsigargin, a
   strong ER stress stimulator. AdoX, an inhibitor of methyltransferase
   activities, produced similar effects than decreased B12 availability on
   SIRT1 and ER stress by a mechanism related to increased expression of
   hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1). Taken together, these data show that
   cellular vitamin B12 has a strong modulating influence on ER stress in
   N1E115 dopaminergic cells. The impaired cellular availability in vitamin
   B12 induces irreversible ER stress by greater acetylation of HSF1
   through decreased SIRT1 expression, whereas adding vitamin B12 produces
   protective effects in cells subjected to ER stress stimulation. Cell

TI Genetic and epigenetic markers in the evaluation of pancreatic masses
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
AB Background Methylation markers have shown promise in the early diagnosis
   of pancreatic carcinoma. The aim of this study was to assess the
   diagnostic utility of hypermethylation status of candidate genes in
   combination with KRAS mutation detection in the evaluation of pancreatic
   masses.
   Experimental design Sixty-one fine needle aspirates of pancreatic masses
   (43 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 18 chronic pancreatitis) were
   studied. Methylation status of HRH2, EN1, SPARC, CDH13 and APC were
   analysed using melting curve analysis after DNA bisulfite treatment.
   KRAS mutations were also analysed.
   Results The methylation panel had a sensitivity of 73% (27 of 37, CI 95%
   56 to 86%) and a specificity of 100% whenever two or more promoters were
   found hypermethylated. KRAS mutations showed a sensitivity of 77% (33 of
   43, CI 95% 62 to 88%) and a specificity of 100%. Both molecular analyses
   added useful information to cytology by increasing the number of
   informative cases. When genetic and epigenetic analyses were combined
   sensitivity was 84% (36 of 43 CI 95% 69 to 93%) maintaining a 100%
   specificity.
   Conclusions Analysis of hypermethylation status of a panel of genes and
   KRAS mutation detection offer a similar diagnostic yield in the
   evaluation of pancreatic masses. The combined molecular analysis
   increases the number of informative cases without diminishing
   specificity.

TI Calcitonin measurement on fine needle washouts: Preanalytical Issues and
   Normal Reference Values
SO DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Calcitonin (CT) measurement on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
   washouts (FNAC-CT) is a promising tool in the diagnosis of medullary
   thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Guidelines for the method with codified cut-off
   are needed to use this technique in clinical routine. This study was
   undertaken to assess the best pre-analytical procedure and to define a
   reliable reference value for FNAC-CT. Fifty-four patients underwent
   thyroid surgery, so MTC was excluded by surgical pathology examination
   and CT immunostains. Before surgery, FNAC-CT was measured on 78 thyroid
   nodules from such 54 patients. Needles were rinsed by normal saline and
   specific CT-free dilution buffer, and CT was measured by a fully
   automated immunochemiluminometric assay. FNAC-CT levels were not
   significantly different in normal saline or specific buffer. The
   calculated 97.5th upper FNAC-CT value was 8.5 pg/mL (saline) and 7.43
   pg/mL (buffer), respectively. Seeing its relatively large sample size,
   rigorous selection criteria and inclusion of CT immunostaining of
   thyroid nodules, the present study provides a reliable guideline and a
   clinically relevant reference value for FNAC-CT measurement in thyroid
   nodules. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Increased levels of DNA methyltransferases are associated with the
   tumorigenic capacity of prostate cancer cells
SO ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB DNA methylation might be the earliest somatic genome changes in prostate
   cancer that also play an important role in the process of tumor
   invasion, growth and metastasis. In recent years, several inhibitors of
   DNA methyltransferases (DNMTis) have been developed and evaluated in
   pre-clinical models and in clinical trials. While these compounds are
   effective in the treatment of hematological conditions, clinical trials
   in solid tumors and in prostate cancer have shown limited or no
   efficacy. This may be attributed to inappropriate dose regimens leading
   to toxicity-related adverse events. As with other anti-target compounds,
   one of the obstacles encountered with DNMTis in prostate cancer could be
   the inability to select patients for the clinical studies as well as the
   inability to monitor the efficacy of the drug if not the conclusion of
   the study. Primary cultures derived from human prostatic tissues
   harvested from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and
   prostate cancer (PCa) as well as neoplastic and non-neoplastic prostate
   cell lines were tested for DNMT expression/activity and to monitor
   azacitidine molecular efficacy. We observed that in primary cultures the
   levels of DNMT activity as well as the protein levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a
   and DNMT3b were higher in cultures derived from PCa compared to BPH
   tissue samples and significantly higher in cultures derived from PCa
   with Gleason scores >= 7 compared to those observed in cultures derived
   from Gleason scores <7. In addition, DNMT activity as well as DNMT1,
   DNMT3a and DNMT3b levels were higher in PCa cell lines compared to their
   non-neoplastic counterparts. Although DNMT activity was higher in high
   tumorigenic/aggressive PCa cell lines compared to low
   tumorigenic/aggressive cell lines, only the levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b
   were significantly higher in the first group of cells, suggesting that
   DNMT1 activity is related to the transition to non-neoplastic versus
   neoplastic phenotype whereas the de novo methylation enzymes were mainly
   related to progression. Nevertheless, the comparison in the more
   aggressive PC3 cell derivatives (PC3-LN4 cells) also possessed higher
   levels of DNMT1 compared to PC3 and PC3M from which these cells were
   derived. Collectively, our results confirm previous data on the
   increased methylation in more aggressive tumors supporting the use of
   DNMTis in advanced prostate cancer. In addition, since glutathione
   S-transferase-pi (GSTP1) was re-expressed or its protein levels were
   increased after treatment with non-toxic azacitidine doses and since
   GSTP1 can easily be measured in patient sera, the monitoring of this
   protein may aide in the evaluation of therapy in future clinical trials.

TI Evolvosides C-E, flavonol-4-O-triglycosides from Evolvulus alsinoides
   and their anti-stress activity
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Phytochemical investigation of the n-butanol fraction of Evolvulus
   alsinoides (Linn.) led to the isolation of three new phenolic
   glycosides, evolvosides C, D and E (1-3) along with six known compounds
   (4-9). The structures of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of
   spectroscopic analysis, viz. 1D and 2D NMR experiments, chemical study,
   and comparison with literature data. Evolvoside C (1) was characterized
   as kaempferol 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 ->
   2)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, whereas
   evolvosides D and E (2-3) were found to be mono and di-O-methyl
   derivatives of 1. The new compounds (1-3) represent rare triglycoside
   derivatives of flavonol at C-4'. The isolated compounds (1-6) were
   screened for acute stress-induced biochemical changes in male
   Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. Compounds 1 and 2
   displayed anti-stress effects by normalizing hyperglycemia, plasma
   corticosterone, plasma creatine kinase, and adrenal hypertrophy.
   Compounds 3 and 6 were also found to be effective in normalizing most of
   these stress parameters, whereas compounds 4 and 5 were ineffective in
   normalizing most of these effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI RNAi pathways contribute to developmental history-dependent phenotypic
   plasticity in C. elegans
SO RNA-A PUBLICATION OF THE RNA SOCIETY
AB Early environmental experiences profoundly influence adult phenotypes
   through complex mechanisms that are poorly understood. We previously
   showed that adult Caenorhabditis elegans that transiently passed through
   the stress-induced dauer larval stage (post-dauer adults) exhibit
   significant changes in gene expression profiles, chromatin states, and
   life history traits when compared with adults that bypassed the dauer
   stage (control adults). These wild-type, isogenic animals of equivalent
   developmental stages exhibit different signatures of molecular marks
   that reflect their distinct developmental trajectories. To gain insight
   into the mechanisms that contribute to these developmental
   history-dependent phenotypes, we profiled small RNAs from post-dauer and
   control adults by deep sequencing. RNA interference (RNAi) pathways are
   known to regulate genome-wide gene expression both at the chromatin and
   post-transcriptional level. By quantifying changes in endogenous small
   interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) levels in post-dauer as compared with
   control animals, our analyses identified a subset of genes that are
   likely targets of developmental history-dependent reprogramming through
   a complex RNAi-mediated mechanism. Mutations in specific endo-siRNA
   pathways affect expected gene expression and chromatin state changes for
   a subset of genes in post-dauer animals, as well as disrupt their
   increased brood size phenotype. We also find that both chromatin state
   and endo-siRNA distribution in dauers are unique, and suggest that
   remodeling in dauers provides a template for the subsequent
   establishment of adult post-dauer profiles. Our results indicate a role
   for endo-siRNA pathways as a contributing mechanism to early
   experience-dependent phenotypic plasticity in adults, and describe how
   developmental history can program adult physiology and behavior via
   epigenetic mechanisms.

TI Genetic Linkages for Thyroxine Released in Response to Thyrotropin
   Stimulation in Three Sets of Recombinant Inbred Mice Provide Evidence
   for Shared and Novel Genes Controlling Thyroid Function
SO THYROID
AB Background: Graves' hyperthyroidism is induced by immunizing mice with
   adenovirus expressing the human thyrotropin (TSH)-receptor. Using
   families of recombinant-inbred mice, we previously discovered that
   genetic susceptibility to induced thyroid-stimulating antibodies and
   hyperthyroidism are linked to loci on different chromosomes, indicating
   a fundamental genetic difference in thyroid sensitivity to ligand
   stimulation. An approach to assess thyroid sensitivity involves
   challenging genetically diverse lines of mice with TSH and measuring the
   genotype/strain-specific increase in serum thyroxine (T4).
   Methods: We investigated genetic susceptibility and genetic control of
   T4 stimulation by 10 mU bovine TSH in female mice of the CXB, BXH, and
   AXB/BXA strain families, all previously studied for induced Graves'
   hyperthyroidism.
   Results: Before TSH injection, T4 levels must be suppressed by
   inhibiting endogenous TSH secretion. Three daily intraperitoneal
   L-triiodothyronine injections efficiently suppressed serum T4 in females
   of 50 of 51 recombinant inbred strains. T4 stimulation by TSH was more
   strongly linked in CXB and BXH sets, derived from parental strains with
   divergent T4 stimulation, than in AXB/BXA strains generated from parents
   with similar TSH-induced responses. Genetic loci linked to the acute
   TSH-induced T4 response (hours) were not the same as those linked to
   induced hyperthyroidism (which develops over months).
   Conclusions: Genetic susceptibility for thyroid sensitivity to TSH
   stimulation was distinct for three families of inbred mouse lines. These
   observations parallel the human situation with multiple genetic loci
   contributing to the same trait and different loci associated with the
   same trait in different ethnic groups. Of the genetic loci highlighted
   in mice, three overlap with, or are located up or downstream, of human
   TSH-controlling genes. Other studies show that human disease genes can
   be identified through cross-species gene mapping of evolutionary
   conserved processes. Consequently, our findings suggest that novel
   thyroid function genes may yet be revealed in humans.

TI Inflammation and Increased Myxovirus Resistance Protein A Expression in
   Thyroid Tissue in the Early Stages of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
SO THYROID
AB Background: The role of viruses as environmental triggers for
   Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is controversial. Thyroid epithelial cells
   express a variety of molecules involved in antiviral responses. This
   study combined histological, immunological, and virological tests to
   describe changes in tissue from patients with newly diagnosed and
   untreated HT. To study the early events, patients with positive thyroid
   peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab) and normal thyroid function were also
   included. This stage was defined as "prethyroiditis.''
   Methods: Thyroid tissue was collected from 47 patients with high titers
   of TPO-Ab and from 24 controls. Seventeen patients had prethyroiditis,
   17 had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 13 had overt hypothyroidism. The
   interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta-inducible myxovirus resistance protein 1
   (myxovirus resistance protein A; MxA) was used as a surrogate marker for
   type I IFN expression. Inflammation, expression of MxA, and the presence
   of the enteroviralcapsid protein (VP1) were characterized by
   immunohistochemistry. The presence of enterovirus (EV) RNA was examined
   by in situ hybridization.
   Results: The density of CD4 + T cells was increased in all three patient
   groups, while CD8 + T cells were increased only in patients with overt
   hypothyroidism. The density of plasma cells increased as the disease
   progressed. The density of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the
   expression of MxA were significantly increased in all patient groups
   compared with controls (p < 0.01). EV RNA was present in 11% of HT
   patients, but in none of the control subjects, whereas the enteroviral
   protein was detected in 19% and 16%, respectively.
   Conclusion: The inflammatory reaction in the thyroid gland is a very
   early event in the pathogenesis of HT. The increased expression of MxA
   in the inflamed tissue suggests that type I IFN plays a role in disease
   development. Whether this is virus-dependent needs to be explored in
   further studies.

TI Effect of a novel 17,20-lyase inhibitor, orteronel (TAK-700), on
   androgen synthesis in male rats
SO JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Endogenous androgens play a role in the development and progression of
   prostate cancer (PC), thus androgen suppression may offer an effective
   therapeutic strategy for this disease. Orteronel (TAK-700),
   6-[(7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-7-yl]-N-methyl-2
   -naphthamide, is a novel, non-steroidal, selective inhibitor of the
   17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A - a key enzyme in the production of
   steroidal hormones - and is being developed as a therapy for PC. The
   purpose of this study was to elucidate the inhibitory activity of
   orteronel, in particular its specificity for androgen synthesis enzymes,
   in male rats - an androgen-synthesis model that largely reflects this
   pathway in humans. Orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity in rats with
   an IC(50) of 1200 nM but did not inhibit 17 alpha-hydroxylase or 11
   beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) activity in rats at concentrations up to 10
   mu M. In cellular steroidogenesis assays using rat testicular cells,
   orteronel suppressed testosterone and androstenedione production with an
   IC50 of 640 nM and 210 nM, respectively, but did not suppress either
   corticosterone or aldosterone production in rat adrenal cells at
   concentrations up to 30 mu M. In addition, serum testosterone and
   androstenedione levels in human chorionic gonadotropin-injected
   hypophysectomized rats were significantly reduced by single oral
   administration of orteronel at a dose of 30 mg/kg (both p <= 0.01);
   serum corticosterone and aldosterone levels in ACTH-injected
   hypophysectomized rats did not result in significant differences
   compared with controls, following orteronel administration at doses up
   to 300 mg/kg. Serum testosterone levels in intact male rats were
   significantly reduced by orteronel 4h after dosing at 100 mg/kg (p <=
   0.01); testosterone levels showed a tendency to recover afterward. In
   intact male rats, the weight of the prostate glands and seminal vesicles
   was decreased in a dose-dependent manner following multiple doses of
   orteronel at 37.5, 150, and 600 mg/kg, TID for 4 days. The reversibility
   of orteronel was further confirmed using a human adrenocortical tumor
   cell line. In summary, orteronel is a selective and reversible
   17,20-lyase inhibitor, and decreases the weight of androgen-dependent
   organs in male rats. Our data suggests that orteronel would therefore be
   effective for androgen-dependent disorders such as PC. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Effects of repeated tickling on conditioned fear and hormonal responses
   in socially isolated rats
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB Positive emotional states have been reported to modify human resilience
   to fear and anxiety, but few animal models are available to elucidate
   underlying mechanisms. In the current study, we examined whether 2 weeks
   of tickling, which is considered to evoke positive emotions, alters
   conditioned fear and hormonal reactions in Fischer rats. We conditioned
   rats to fear an auditory tone which was initially paired with a mild
   foot-shock (0.2 mA), and retention test was conducted 48 h and 96 h
   after conditioning. During these tests, we found that prior tickling
   treatment significantly diminished fear-induced freezing. To examine the
   effects of tickling on sympatho-adrenal and
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses associated with conditioned
   fear, we measured plasma catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the
   retention test 96 h after conditioning. The plasma catecholamine
   concentration of non-tickled rats was higher than basal levels, whereas
   tickled rats showed significantly reduced concentrations of both plasma
   adrenaline and noradrenaline. No significant differences in plasma
   corticosterone levels were observed between tickled and non-tickled
   rats. These results suggest that repeated exposure to tickling can
   modulate fear-related behavior and sympatho-adrenal stress responses.

TI Does forest stand structure impact the dynamics of snow on winter
   grazing grounds of reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus)?
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB The landscape in boreal Sweden is dominated by even-aged, single-layered
   forest monocultures and clear cuts. Few forest stands with a more
   complex, multi-layered structure remain as landscape elements. We
   studied the impact that different forest management regimes have on snow
   conditions and the metamorphosis of snow, and discuss how these factors
   may affect suitability for reindeer grazing.
   Over two winters, we recorded the development of snow depth and hardness
   in clear cuts and two different forest types, and their changes with
   weather events. In the forests, the dynamics of snow characteristics
   were analyzed in relation to stand structure and at the level of
   individual trees.
   There were no clear differences in snow characteristics between
   single-layered and multi-layered stands, although snow hardness was more
   variable in the latter. In single-layered stands, snow depth and
   hardness were spatially uniformly distributed in relation to stand
   characteristics. Contrastingly, the complex structure of multi-layered
   stands did influence snow depth significantly. However, hardness was
   highly heterogeneous in these stands. Due to the absence of tree
   effects, clear cuts had deeper but softer snow than forested stands,
   although hardness increased towards spring.
   Weather affected the metamorphosis of the snow blanket. The magnitude of
   the effects depended on both timing and severity of discrete weather
   events and forest structure, but generally weather had a greater
   influence on snow cover characteristics than forest structure per se. In
   their interaction with weather, different forest structures affect the
   snow and thus suitability as winter grazing area for reindeer. Reindeer
   herders, therefore, require diversity in the landscape in order to
   respond to such weather variations and their impact on grazing
   conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancer activity sensitive to the orientation of the gene it regulates
   in the chordate genome
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Enhancers are flexible in terms of their location and orientation
   relative to the genes they regulate. However, little is known about
   whether the flexibility can be applied in every combination of enhancers
   and genes. Enhancer detection with transposable elements is a powerful
   method to identify enhancers in the genome and to create marker lines
   expressing fluorescent proteins in a tissue-specific manner. In the
   chordate Ciona intestinalis, this method has been established with a
   Tc1/mariner superfamily transposon Minos. Previously, we created the
   enhancer detection line E[MiTSAdTPOG]15 (E15) that specifically
   expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the central nervous system
   (CNS) after metamorphosis. In this study, we identified the causal
   insertion site of the transgenic line. There are two genes flanking the
   causal insertion of the E15 line, and the genomic region around the
   insertion site contains the enhancers responsible for the expression in
   the endostyle and gut in addition to the CNS. We found that the
   endostyle and gut enhancers show sensitivity to the orientation of the
   GFP gene for their enhancer activity. Namely, the enhancers cannot
   enhance the expression of GFP which is inserted at the same orientation
   as the EIS line, while the enhancers can enhance GFP expression inserted
   at the opposite orientation. The CNS enhancer can enhance GFP expression
   in both orientations. The DNA element adjacent to the endostyle enhancer
   is responsible for the orientation sensitivity of the enhancer. The
   different sensitivity of the enhancers to the orientation of the
   transgene is a cause of CNS-specific GFP expression in the EIS line. (C)

TI Identification of Novel Bacterial M.SssI DNA Methyltransferase
   Inhibitors
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING
AB DNA methylation is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression.
   Abnormalities in DNA methylation patterns have been associated with
   various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancer.
   Targeting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) represents a promising strategy
   for the treatment of such diseases. Current DNMT inhibitors suffer
   important drawbacks with respect to their efficacy, specificity, and
   toxicity. In this study, we have set up a robust in vitro bacterial
   M.SssI DNMT activity assay to systematically screen a collection of 26
   240 compounds that were predicted to compete with the
   S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) substrate of DNMT. This resulted in the
   identification of a novel set of structurally distinct inhibitors of
   M.SssI DNMT activity. Although molecular docking studies using an M.SssI
   homology model suggest that these compounds might compete with SAM
   binding, mode of activity (MoA) assays are still needed to confirm this
   hypothesis. Our set of novel M.SssI DNMT inhibitors, once confirmed in
   an orthogonal DNMT assay, may thus serve as a starting point to identify
   and characterize suitable lead candidates for further drug optimization.

TI Basic concepts of epigenetics
SO FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB Several types of epigenetic marks facilitate the complex patterning
   required for normal human development. These epigenetic marks include
   DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides, covalent modifications of histone
   proteins, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). They function in a highly
   orchestrated manner, regulating mitotically heritable differences in
   gene expression potential without altering the primary DNA sequence. In
   germ cells and the developing embryo, genome-wide epigenetic
   reprogramming drives the erasure and reestablishment of correct
   epigenetic patterns at critical developmental time periods and in
   specific cell types. Two specific types of epigenetic regulation
   established in early development include X-chromosome inactivation and
   genomic imprinting; they regulate gene expression in a dosage-dependent
   and parent-of-origin-specific manner, respectively. Both genetic and
   environmental factors impact epigenetic marks, generating phenotypic
   variation that ranges from normal variation to human disease. Aberrant
   epigenetic patterning can lead to a variety of human disorders,
   including subfertility and imprinting disorders. (Fertil Steril (R)

TI Formation process of staining-type hypermelanosis in Japanese flounder
   juveniles revealed by examination of chromatophores and scales
SO FISHERIES SCIENCE
AB Staining-type hypermelanosis, defined as blind-side melanosis occurring
   after completion of metamorphosis, reduces commercial value in
   hatchery-produced flatfishes. Detailed characterization was performed on
   the stained area of juvenile Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus to
   physiologically understand this phenomenon. From 80 to 120 days after
   hatching, juveniles were reared in sandy and sandless tanks. By
   classifying the staining degree into 7 levels, about 2 times higher
   occurrence of middle-level staining was reconfirmed in sandless tank
   (about 80 %) than in sandy tank (about 40 %). In the stained area, we
   found 3 types of chromatophores (melanophore, xanthophore, and
   iridophore) and ctenoid scales, which would be typically observed on the
   normal ocular side. Detailed examination on the melanophores revealed
   further similarity between the stained area and the normal ocular side,
   in terms of the distribution at 2 layers (shallower and deeper than
   scale), and the densities in both layers (about 1000 cells/mm(2) above
   scale and 200 cells/mm(2) beneath scale). These results strongly suggest
   that the staining is a status change in the body surface conditions from
   the blind side to that on the ocular side, and not a simple darkening
   caused by disordered proliferation of melanophores on the blind side.

TI Mitoplasticity: Adaptation Biology of the Mitochondrion to the Cellular
   Redox State in Physiology and Carcinogenesis
SO ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING
AB Adaptation and transformation biology of the mitochondrion to redox
   status is an emerging domain of physiology and pathophysiology.
   Mitochondrial adaptations occur in response to accidental changes in
   cellular energy demand or supply while mitochondrial transformations are
   a part of greater program of cell metamorphosis. The possible role of
   mitochondrial adaptations and transformations in pathogenesis remains
   unexplored, and it has become critical to decipher the stimuli and the
   underlying molecular pathways. Immediate activation of mitochondrial
   function was described during acute exercise, respiratory chain injury,
   Endoplasmic Reticulum stress, genotoxic stress, or environmental toxic
   insults. Delayed adaptations of mitochondrial form, composition, and
   functions were evidenced for persistent changes in redox status as
   observed in endurance training, in fibroblasts grown in presence of
   respiratory chain inhibitors or in absence of glucose, in the smooth
   muscle of patients with severe asthma, or in the skeletal muscle of
   patients with a mitochondrial disease. Besides, mitochondrial
   transformations were observed in the course of human cell
   differentiation, during immune response activation, or in cells
   undergoing carcinogenesis. Little is known on the signals and downstream
   pathways that govern mitochondrial adaptations and transformations. Few
   adaptative loops, including redox sensors, kinases, and transcription
   factors were deciphered, but their implication in physiology and
   pathology remains elusive. Mitoplasticity could play a protective role
   against aging, diabetes, cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases. Research
   on adaptation and transformation could allow the design of innovative
   therapies, notably in cancer. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 18, 808-849.

TI Role of the Endothelial-Derived Endogenous Anti-Inflammatory Factor
   Del-1 in Inflammation-Mediated Adrenal Gland Dysfunction
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Inflammation in the course of systemic inflammatory response syndrome
   (SIRS) or sepsis often results in dysregulation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the underlying mechanisms
   are not well understood. The adrenal gland is highly vascularized; thus,
   we hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction may actively participate in
   inflammation-related adrenal insufficiency. To address this hypothesis,
   we used the properties of developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1),
   which is an endothelial-derived anti-inflammatory factor that
   antagonizes integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion. Here we identified
   that Del-1 is expressed in the adrenal gland and that its expression was
   downregulated upon SIRS induction by systemic lipopolysaccharide
   administration. Furthermore, we observed increased leukocyte
   accumulation, inflammation, and higher apoptosis in the adrenal glands
   of Del-1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Strikingly,
   Del-1 deficiency was also associated with reduced corticosterone and
   ACTH levels 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide administration. Together,
   these data suggest that Del-1 may act as a gatekeeper of adrenal gland
   inflammation and may regulate the integrity of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response, thereby modulating
   adrenal (dys) function in the course of SIRS. (Endocrinology 154:

TI Drosophila SUUR protein associates with PCNA and binds chromatin in a
   cell cycle-dependent manner
SO CHROMOSOMA
AB Drosophila SUUR (Suppressor of UnderReplication) protein was shown to
   regulate the DNA replication elongation process in endocycling cells.
   This protein is also known to be the component of silent chromatin in
   polyploid and diploid cells. To mark the different cell cycle stages, we
   used immunostaining patterns of PCNA, the main structural component of
   replication fork. We demonstrate that SUUR chromatin binding is dynamic
   throughout the endocyle in Drosophila salivary glands. We observed that
   SUUR chromosomal localization changed along with PCNA pattern and these
   proteins largely co-localized during the late S-phase in salivary
   glands. The hypothesized interaction between SUUR and PCNA was confirmed
   by co-immunoprecipitation from embryonic nuclear extracts. Our findings
   support the idea that the effect of SUUR on replication elongation
   depends on the cell cycle stage and can be mediated through its physical
   interaction with replication fork.

TI Yolky eggs prepare for metabolic acceleration
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
AB Embryos convert some of their reserve into structure during development.
   At birth, enough must be left for further maturation, which implicitly
   defines the minimum amount of initial reserve. The maximum amount occurs
   if the mother is well-fed. Yolkiness is defined as the ratio of the
   maximum and the minimum amounts of initial reserve of an animal egg.
   Embryo development is frequently slower than can be expected on the
   basis of late juvenile and adult development. So development accelerates
   during the early juvenile stage, quantified as the ratio of the lengths
   at metamorphosis and at birth; during acceleration maximum specific
   assimilation and energy conductance increase with length. Parameters of
   the standard DEB model have now been estimated for some 165 species, and
   the goodness of fit with data is typically very good. These parameters
   have been used to quantify yolkiness and metabolic acceleration and a
   clear proportionality relationship resulted. I present some suggestions
   for explanations in the context of life histories.

TI Histone H5chromatin interactions in situ are strongly modulated by H5
   C-terminal phosphorylation
SO CYTOMETRY PART A
AB We used linker histone-depleted normal human fibroblast nuclei as
   templates to study how phosphorylation affects histone H5 binding to
   chromatin in situ. Permeabilized cells were treated with 0.7 M NaCl to
   extract the native linker histones. Histone H5 was purified from chicken
   erythrocytes and phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant cdk5/p35 kinase.
   High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) showed that the
   phosphorylated protein contained a mixture of multiply phosphorylated
   forms. Control experiments, using mass spectrometry, revealed that up to
   five SPXK motifs in the C terminus were phosphorylated, but also that
   about 10% of the protein contained one phosphoserine in the N-terminus.
   Reconstitution of H1-depleted fibroblast nuclei with nonphosphorylated
   or phosphorylated H5 was performed at physiological ionic strength. The
   bound H5 was then extracted using NaCl concentrations in the range of
   0.15 to 0.7 M. The release of the H5 molecules was monitored by DAPI
   staining and image cytofluorometry. Our results show that H5
   phosphorylation substantially reduced its affinity for chromatin in

TI Aberrant upregulation of ASCL2 by promoter demethylation promotes the
   growth and resistance to 5-fluorouracil of gastric cancer cells
SO CANCER SCIENCE
AB Achaete scute-like 2 (ASCL2), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
   factor, plays an essential role in the maintenance of adult intestinal
   stem cells. However, the function of ASCL2 in gastric cancer (GC) is
   poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the roles and regulatory
   transcription mechanisms of ASCL2 in GC. Gene expression and methylation
   data analysis showed that ASCL2 was upregulated and hypomethylated in GC
   tissues. Using real-time RT-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis, we
   confirmed that ASCL2 was overexpressed and hypomethylated in GC tissues
   compared to adjacent normal tissues. We then investigated the mechanisms
   underlying the aberrant expression of ASCL2 in GC and found that
   treatment with a methylation inhibitor induced ASCL2 expression in GC
   cell lines. MBD-sequencing assay also revealed hypermethylation of the
   promoter region of ASCL2 in GC cell lines, which barely expressed the
   ASCL2 gene. Furthermore, ASCL2 expression levels were inversely
   correlated with GC patient survival. Ectopic overexpression of ASCL2
   showed that ASCL2 increased cell growth and promoted resistance to
   5-fluorouracil in GC cells. These results suggest that ASCL2 might play
   an important role in gastric tumor growth and chemoresistance, and could
   be a useful prognostic marker for GC patients.

TI Rhabdoid Tumors: An Initial Clue to the Role of Chromatin Remodeling in
   Cancer
SO BRAIN PATHOLOGY
AB The discovery of biallelic, inactivating SMARCB1 mutations in rhabdoid
   tumors (RTs) over a decade ago represented the first recognized link
   between chromatin remodeling and tumor suppression. SMARCB1 is a core
   subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and the recent
   emergence of frequent mutations in genes that encode subunits of this
   complex across a wide variety of cancers suggests that perturbation of
   this chromatin remodeling complex constitutes a key driver of cancer
   formation. Despite the highly aggressive nature of RTs, they are
   genetically simple cancers that appear to lack chromosomal instability
   and contain very few mutations. Indeed, the mutation rate in RTs is
   among the lowest of all cancers sequenced, with loss of SMARCB1 as
   essentially the sole recurrent event. Given the genetic simplicity of
   this disease, understanding the chromatin dysregulation caused by
   SMARCB1 loss may provide more general insight into how epigenetic
   alterations can contribute to oncogenic transformation and may reveal
   opportunities for targeted therapy not only of RT but also the variety
   of other SWI/SNF mutant cancers.

TI Naive pluripotency is associated with global DNA hypomethylation
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Naive pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonic germ cells
   (EGCs) are derived from the preimplantation epiblast and primordial germ
   cells (PGCs), respectively. We investigated whether differences exist
   between ESCs and EGCs, in view of their distinct developmental origins.
   PGCs are programmed to undergo global DNA demethylation; however, we
   find that EGCs and ESCs exhibit equivalent global DNA methylation
   levels. Inhibition of MEK and Gsk3b by 2i conditions leads to pronounced
   reduction in DNA methylation in both cell types. This is driven by
   Prdm14 and is associated with downregulation of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.
   However, genomic imprints are maintained in 2i, and we report derivation
   of EGCs with intact genomic imprints. Collectively, our findings
   establish that culture in 2i instills a naive pluripotent state with a
   distinctive epigenetic configuration that parallels molecular features
   observed in both the preimplantation epiblast and nascent PGCs.

TI Proteomic and Functional Analyses Reveal the Role of Chromatin Reader
   SFMBT1 in Regulating Epigenetic Silencing and the Myogenic Gene Program
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB SFMBT1 belongs to the malignant brain tumor domain-containing chromatin
   reader family that recognizes repressive histone marks and represses
   transcription. The biological functions and molecular basis underlying
   SFMBT1-mediated transcriptional repression are poorly elucidated. Here,
   our proteomic analysis revealed that SFMBT1 is associated with multiple
   transcriptional corepressor complexes, including CtBP/LSD1/HDAC
   complexes, polycomb repressive complexes, and malignant brain tumor
   family proteins, that collectively contribute to SFMBT1 repressor
   activity. During myogenesis, Sfmbt1 represses myogenic differentiation
   of cultured and primary myoblasts. Mechanistically, Sfmbt1 interacts
   with MyoD and mediates epigenetic silencing of MyoD target genes via
   recruitment of its associated corepressors and subsequent induction of
   epigenetic modifications and chromatin compaction. Therefore, our study
   identified novel mechanisms accounting for SFMBT1-mediated transcription
   repression and revealed an essential role of Sfmbt1 in regulating
   MyoD-mediated transcriptional silencing that is required for the
   maintenance of undifferentiated states of myogenic progenitor cells.

   examined in 2010 and 1411 in 1995.
   Results: In 2010, 757 of 1148 subjects ( 65.9%) routinely used iodized
   salt, urinary iodine excretion being significantly higher than in 1955 (
   median 98.0 mu g/L, vs 55.0 mu g/L, P <.0001). The prevalence of goiter
   was lower in 2010 than in 1995 ( 25.8% vs 46.1%, P <.0001), mainly due
   to the reduction of diffuse goiter ( 10.3% vs 34.0%, P <.0001). In 2010
   vs 1995, thyroid autonomy in subjects younger than 45 years old ( 3 of
   579, 0.5% vs 25 of 1010, 2.5% P = .004) and nonautoimmune
   hyperthyroidism in subjects older than 45 years old ( 8 of 569, 1.4% vs
   18 of 401, 4.5%, P = .03) were less frequent. The prevalence of
   hypothyroidism was higher in 2010 vs 1995 ( 5.0% vs 2.8%, P = .005),
   mainly because of an increased frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism
   in subjects younger than 15 years old ( 7 of 83, 8.4% vs 0 of 419, 0.0%,
   P < .0001). Accordingly, serum thyroid autoantibodies ( 19.5% vs 12.6%;
   P < .0001) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis ( 14.5% vs 3.5%; P < .0001) were
   more frequent in 2010 than in 1995.
   Conclusions: In the present work, the role of voluntary iodine
   prophylaxis was assessed in a small rural community relatively
   segregated, in which genetic and other environmental factors have not
   substantially changed between the 2 surveys. Iodine intake strongly
   affected the pattern of thyroid diseases, but the benefits of correcting
   iodine deficiency ( decreased prevalence of goiter and thyroid autonomy
   in younger subjects and reduced frequency of nonautoimmune
   hyperthyroidism in older subjects) far outweighs the risk of development
   of thyroid autoimmunity and mild hypothyroidism in youngsters. (J Clin

TI Antidepressant-like effect of flaxseed secoisolariciresinol diglycoside
   in ovariectomized mice subjected to unpredictable chronic stress
SO METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE
AB Secoisolariciresinoldiglycoside (SDG), a predominant lignan in flaxseed,
   has antioxidant activity as a dietary supplement. The purpose of the
   present study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effect and the
   possible mechanism of flaxseed SDG when the ovariectomized mice were
   exposed to the unpredictable chronic mild stress procedure. Chronic
   stress induced the increases in immobility time in mouse model of
   despair tests, but administration with SDG (80 and 160 mg/kg, p.o.) for
   21 days inhibited these behavioral changes caused by stress in both
   forced swimming and tail suspension tests. These doses that affected the
   immobile response did not affect locomotor activity. Moreover, the
   changes in the serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone
   (ACTH) levels were also measured to explore the SDG-associated
   regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenals (HPA) axis. The results
   indicated that the chronic stress-induced increases in the serum
   corticosterone and ACTH were reversed by treatment with high doses of
   SDG. Chronic treatment with SDG also affected the body weight of mice
   and IL-6, IL1 beta levels in the frontal cortex. In addition, chronic
   stress procedure induced a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor
   (BDNF) expression in the frontal cortex of mice; while treatment with
   SDG reversed this reduction of BDNF. All these results provide
   compelling evidence that the behavioral effects of flaxseed SDG in the
   ovariectomized mice might be related to their modulating effects on the
   neuroendocrine-immune network and neurotrophin factor expression.

TI Emerging Insights into the Ependymoma Epigenome
SO BRAIN PATHOLOGY
AB Ependymoma is the third most common pediatric brain tumor, yet because
   of the paucity of effective therapeutic interventions, 45% of patients
   remain incurable. Recent transcriptional and copy number profiling of
   the disease has identified few driver genes and in fact points to a
   balanced genomic profile. Candidate gene approaches looking at
   hypermethylated promoters and genome-wide epigenetic arrays suggest that
   DNA methylation may be critical to ependymoma pathogenesis. This review
   attempts to highlight existing and emerging evidence implicating the
   ependymoma epigenome as a key player and that epigenetic modifiers may
   offer new targeted therapeutic avenues for patients.

TI Hormonal Causes of Male Sexual Dysfunctions and Their Management
   (Hyperprolactinemia, Thyroid Disorders, GH Disorders, and DHEA)
SO JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE
AB Introduction. Besides hypogonadism, other endocrine disorders have been
   associated with male sexual dysfunction (MSD). Aim. To review the role
   of the pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), thyroid
   hormones, and adrenal androgens in MSD. Methods. A systematic search of
   published evidence was performed using Medline (1969 to September 2011).
   Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based MedicineLevels of Evidence (March 2009)
   was applied when possible. Main Outcome Measures. The most important
   evidence regarding the role played by PRL, GH, thyroid, and adrenal
   hormone was reviewed and discussed. Results. Only severe
   hyperprolactinemia (>35ng/mL or 735mU/L), often related to a pituitary
   tumor, has a negative impact on sexual function, impairing sexual
   desire, testosterone production, and, through the latter, erectile
   function due to a dual effect: mass effect and PRL-induced suppression
   on gonadotropin secretion. The latter is PRL-level dependent. Emerging
   evidence indicates that hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased
   risk of premature ejaculation and might also be associated with erectile
   dysfunction (ED), whereas hypothyroidism mainly affects sexual desire
   and impairs the ejaculatory reflex. However, the real incidence of
   thyroid dysfunction in subjects with sexual problems needs to be
   evaluated. Prevalence of ED and decreased libido increase in acromegalic
   patients; however, it is still a matter of debate whether GH excess
   (acromegaly) may create effects due to a direct overproduction of
   GH/insulin-like growth factor 1 or because of the pituitary mass effects
   on gonadotropic cells, resulting in hypogonadism. Finally, although
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate have been implicated in a
   broad range of biological derangements, controlled trials have shown
   that DHEA administration is not useful for improving male sexual
   function. Conclusions. While the association between hyperprolactinemia
   and hypoactive sexual desire is well defined, more studies are needed to
   completely understand the role of other hormones in regulating male
   sexual functioning. Maggi M, Buvat J, Corona G, Guay A, and Torres LO.

TI Stress, seizures, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis targets for
   the treatment of epilepsy
SO EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR
AB Epilepsy is a heterogeneous condition with varying etiologies including
   genetics, infection, trauma, vascular, neoplasms, and toxic exposures.
   The overlap of psychiatric comorbidity adds to the challenge of optimal
   treatment for people with epilepsy. Seizure episodes themselves may have
   varying triggers; however, for decades, stress has been commonly and
   consistently suspected to be a trigger for seizure events. This paper
   explores the relationship between stress and seizures and reviews
   clinical data as well as animal studies that increasingly corroborate
   the impact of stress hormones on neuronal excitability and seizure
   susceptibility. The basis for enthusiasm for targeting glucocorticoid
   receptors for the treatment of epilepsy and the mixed results of such
   treatment efforts are reviewed. In addition, this paper will highlight
   recent findings identifying a regulatory pathway controlling the body's
   physiological response to stress which represents a novel therapeutic
   target for modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
   Thus, the HPA axis may have important clinical implications for seizure
   control and imply use of anticonvulsants that influence this neuronal
   pathway. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "The Future of

TI A Proline-Tyrosine Nuclear Localization Signal (PY-NLS) Is Required for
   the Nuclear Import of Fission Yeast PAB2, but Not of Human PABPN1
SO TRAFFIC
AB Nuclear poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are evolutionarily conserved
   proteins that play key roles in eukaryotic gene expression. In the
   fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the major nuclear PABP, Pab2,
   functions in the maturation of small nucleolar RNAs as well as in
   nuclear RNA decay. Despite knowledge about its nuclear functions,
   nothing is known about how Pab2 is imported into the nucleus. Here, we
   show that Pab2 contains a proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal
   (PY-NLS) that is necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization
   and function. Consistent with the role of karyopherin 2 (Kap2)-type
   receptors in the import of PY-NLS cargoes, we show that the fission
   yeast ortholog of human Kap2, Kap104, binds to recombinant Pab2 and is
   required for Pab2 nuclear localization. The absence of arginine
   methylation in a basic region N-terminal to the PY-core motif of Pab2
   did not affect its nuclear localization. However, in the context of a
   sub-optimal PY-NLS, we found that Pab2 was more efficiently targeted to
   the nucleus in the absence of arginine methylation, suggesting that this
   modification can affect the import kinetics of a PY-NLS cargo. Although
   a sequence resembling a PY-NLS motif can be found in the human Pab2
   ortholog, PABPN1, our results indicate that neither a functional PY-NLS
   nor Kap2 activity are required to promote entry of PABPN1 into the
   nucleus of human cells. Our findings describe the mechanism by which
   Pab2 is imported into the nucleus, providing the first example of a
   PY-NLS import system in fission yeast. In addition, this study suggests
   the existence of alternative or redundant nuclear import pathways for
   human PABPN1.

TI DHEA Prevents Mineralo- and Glucocorticoid Receptor-Induced Chronotropic
   and Hypertrophic Actions in Isolated Rat Cardiomyocytes
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Corticosteroids have been involved in the genesis of ventricular
   arrhythmias associated with pathological heart hypertrophy, although
   molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects have not been
   completely explained. Because mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
   antagonists have been demonstrated to be beneficial on the cardiac
   function, much attention has been given to the action of aldosterone on
   the heart. However, we have previously shown that both aldosterone and
   corticosterone in vitro induce a marked acceleration of the spontaneous
   contractions, as well as a significant cell hypertrophy in isolated
   neonate rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Moreover, a beneficial role of
   the steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been also
   proposed, but the mechanism of its putative cardioprotective function is
   not known. We found that DHEA reduces both the chronotropic and the
   hypertrophic responses of cardiomyocytes upon stimulation of MR and
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in vitro. DHEA inhibitory effects were
   accompanied by a decrease of T-type calcium channel expression and
   activity, as assessed by quantitative PCR and the patch-clamp technique.
   Prevention of cell hypertrophy by DHEA was also revealed by measuring
   the expression of A-type natriuretic peptide and BNP. The kinetics of
   the negative chronotropic effect of DHEA, and its sensitivity to
   actinomycin D, pointed out the presence of both genomic and nongenomic
   mechanisms of action. Although the genomic action of DHEA was effective
   mostly upon MR activation, its rapid, nongenomic response appeared
   related to DHEA antioxidant properties. On the whole, these results
   suggest new mechanisms for a putative cardioprotective role of DHEA in
   corticosteroid-associated heart diseases. (Endocrinology 154: 1271-1281,

TI The Role of Angiotensin II on Sodium Appetite After a Low-Sodium Diet
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The present study aimed to investigate the role of angiotensin II
   (AngII) on sodium appetite in rats subjected to a normal or a low-sodium
   diet (1% or >0.1% NaCl) for 4days. During sodium restriction, a
   reduction in water intake, urinary volume and sodium excretion was
   observed. After a low-sodium diet, we observed decreased plasma protein
   concentrations and haematocrit associated with a slight reduction in
   arterial pressure, without any significant changes in heart rate,
   natraemia, corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the
   paraventricular nucleus and corticosterone levels. After providing
   hypertonic saline, there was an increase in saline intake followed by a
   small increase in water intake, resulting in an enhanced saline intake
   ratio and the recovery of arterial pressure. Sodium deprivation
   increased plasma but not brain Ang I and II concentrations. A low-sodium
   diet increased kidney renin and liver angiotensinogen mRNA levels but
   not lung angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNA expression. Moreover, Ang II
   type 1a receptor mRNA expression was increased in the subfornical organ
   and the dorsal raphe nucleus and decreased in the medial preoptic
   nuclei, without changes in the paraventricular nucleus and the nucleus
   of solitary tract after a low-sodium diet. Blockade of AT1 receptors or
   brain Ang II synthesis led to a reduction in sodium intake after a
   low-sodium diet. Intracerebroventricular injection of Ang II led to a
   similar increase in sodium and water intake in the control and
   low-sodium diet groups. In conclusion, the results of the present study
   suggest that Ang II is involved in the increased sodium appetite after a
   low-sodium diet.

TI DARC (Duffy) and BCAM (Lutheran) reduced expression in thyroid cancer
SO BLOOD CELLS MOLECULES AND DISEASES
AB Duffy or DARC (Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines) is a glycosylated
   membrane protein that selectively binds angiogenic chemokines. Previous
   in vivo and in vitro studies of DARC function in cancer have associated
   DARC over expression with better prognosis, decreased metastatic
   potential, and inhibition of tumor-associated neovascularization.
   Another carcinogenesis-associated antigen is Lutheran or BCAM (basal
   cell adhesion molecule), a surface glycoprotein that acts as a receptor
   for the extracellular matrix protein, laminin. BCAM is a protein related
   to tumor progression; and, its over expression is associated with skin,
   ovarian and pancreatic cancers. We explored DARC and BCAM functions and
   investigated whether or not their expressions were altered in thyroid
   cancer. The expression of DARC and BCAM were evaluated by quantitative
   real-time PCR (qPCR) in a set of 18 normal thyroid tissues (NT), 15
   follicular adenomas (ETA), 17 follicular carcinomas (FTC), and 122
   papillary thyroid carcinomas (FTC), including 78 classical (CVPTC) and
   44 follicular variant (FVPTC). RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed to
   cDNA, and used in qPCR reactions containing SYBR Green. The relative
   expression value was calculated using ribosomal protein S8 as an
   internal control. When we compared benign (NT and FTA) versus malignant
   samples (FTC, CVPTC and FVPTC) we observed a significant decrease of
   DARC and BCAM relative expression in malignant cases. Additionally, we
   correlated clinic-pathological features (tumor size, presence of
   metastasis, presence of lymphocyte infiltrate) with DARC and BCAM
   expression. We found a diminished expression of DARC in PTC samples,
   which was correlated with tumor size and presence of a lymphocyte
   infiltrate. We, also, found a correlation between decreased BCAM
   expression and tumor size or presence of metastasis. DARC and BCAM
   expression was associated with pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma and
   correlated with clinical-pathological features. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Creating new beta cells: cellular transmutation by genomic alchemy
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB To address insulin insufficiency, diabetes research has long focused on
   techniques for replacing insulin-producing beta cells. Studies in mice
   have suggested that, under some conditions, alpha cells possess the
   capacity to transdifferentiate into beta cells, although the mechanisms
   that drive this conversion are unclear. In this issue, Bramswig et al.
   analyzed the methylation states of purified human alpha, beta, and
   acinar cells and found alpha cells exhibit intrinsic phenotypic
   plasticity associated with specific histone methylation profiles. In
   addition to expanding our understanding of this potential source of beta
   cells, this compendium of carefully generated human gene expression and

TI The Endocrine Disrupting Chemical Tolylfluanid Alters Adipocyte
   Metabolism via Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation
SO MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoid signaling plays a critical role in regulating energy
   metabolism. Emerging data implicate environmental endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals as contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics.
   Previous studies have shown that the phenylsulfamide fungicide
   tolylfluanid (TF) augments glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent
   luciferase expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while modulating insulin
   action in primary murine and human adipocytes. Studies were performed to
   interrogate glucocorticoid signaling in primary adipocytes exposed to
   TF. TF mimicked the gene transcription profile of the murine
   glucocorticoid corticosterone (Cort). Cellular fractionation assays
   demonstrated that TF treatment promoted the activating serine
   phosphorylation of GR, augmenting its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear
   translocation as well as its enrichment at glucocorticoid response
   elements on the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper gene promoter.
   After acute treatment, Cort or TF promoted insulin receptor substrate-1
   (IRS-1) gene and protein expression. Either treatment also enriched GR
   binding at an identified glucocorticoid response element in the IRS-1
   gene. TF or Cort each increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, an
   effect resulting from increased lipogenic gene expression and enhanced
   insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase.
   The augmentation of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was mediated through
   a specific enhancement of Akt phosphorylation at T308. These findings
   support modulation of IRS-1 levels as a mechanism for
   glucocorticoid-mediated changes in insulin action in primary adipocytes.
   Albeit with less affinity than Cort, in silico analysis suggests that TF
   can interact with the ligand binding pocket of GR. Collectively, these
   studies identify TF as a structurally unique environmental
   glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid signaling may thus represent a novel
   pathway by which environmental toxicants promote the development of
   metabolic diseases. (Molecular Endocrinology 27: 394-406, 2013)

TI Using Body Mass Index to Predict Optimal Thyroid Dosing after
   Thyroidectomy
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AB BACKGROUND: Current postoperative thyroid replacement dosing is weight
   based, with adjustments made after thyroid-stimulating hormone values.
   This method can lead to considerable delays in achieving euthyroidism
   and often fails to accurately dose over-and underweight patients. Our
   aim was to develop an accurate dosing method that uses patient body mass
   index (BMI) data.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected
   thyroid database was performed. We selected adult patients undergoing
   thyroidectomy, with benign pathology, who achieved euthyroidism on
   thyroid hormone supplementation. Body mass index and euthyroid dose were
   plotted and regression was used to fit curves to the data. Statistical
   analysis was performed using STATA 10.1 software (Stata Corp).
   RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients met inclusion criteria. At
   initial follow-up, only 39 patients were euthyroid (32%). Fifty-three
   percent of patients with BMI >30 kg/m(2) were overdosed, and 46% of
   patients with BMI <25 kg/m(2) were underdosed. The line of best fit
   demonstrated an overall quadratic relationship between BMI and euthyroid
   dose. A linear relationship best described the data up to a BMI of 50.
   Beyond that, the line approached 1.1 mu g/kg. A regression equation was
   derived for calculating initial levothyroxine dose (mg/kg/d = -0.018 x
   BMI + 2.13 [F statistic = 52.7, root mean square error of 0.24]).
   CONCLUSIONS: The current standard of weight-based thyroid replacement
   fails to appropriately dose underweight and overweight patients. Body
   mass index can be used to more accurately dose thyroid hormone using a
   simple formula. (J Am Coll Surg 2013;216:454-460. (C) 2013 by the

TI Benzyl isothiocyanate disturbs lipid metabolism in rats in a way
   independent of its thyroid impact following in vivo long-term treatment
   and in vitro adipocytes studies
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB During recent decades, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) was examined mainly
   in terms of its cancer chemopreventive action. Although some research
   has been conducted on goitrogenic activity of many glucosinolate
   derivatives, little attention has been paid to the BITC impact on the
   thyroid gland and lipid metabolism strictly associated with it.
   Therefore, this research project aimed at expanding our knowledge about
   how non-physiological doses of BITC (widely used in chemotherapy)
   influence some hormonal and metabolic (lipid) parameters in in vivo and
   in vitro experiments. The trial was focused on BITC action on thyroid
   tissue, liver, as well as white adipocyte tissue, at doses which were
   previously proved to exert a strong anticancer effect (10 mg/kg body
   weight in vivo and 1, 10 and 100 mu mol/L in in vitro trials,
   respectively). Two-week oral administration of BITC in in vivo trial
   affected thyroid gland by decreasing total thyroxine and
   triiodothyronine. However, the obtained lipid profile was not specific
   for thyroid hormone deficiency because no lipid changes in the blood
   serum and liver steatosis were observed. BITC per se evoked elevation of
   basal lipolysis at 1 and 100 mu mol/L and limitation of basal
   lipogenesis at 100 mu mol/L in adipocyte tissues in in vitro experiment.
   BITC did not remain indifferent to liver metabolism by its possible
   influence on hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 5-deiodinase as
   well as on adipocytes by its enhanced basal lipolysis and limited
   lipogenesis independently of epinephrine and insulin action steps,

TI Priming of Metabolic Dysfunctions by Prenatal Immune Activation in Mice:
   Relevance to Schizophrenia
SO SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk for multiple metabolic
   abnormalities, including altered glucose homeostasis, type-2 diabetes,
   obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Some of the metabolic alterations
   can already exist in psychosis-prone subjects prior to the onset of
   chronic schizophrenic disease and pharmacotherapy, indicating that they
   may have a developmental origin. In the present study, we tested the
   hypothesis that metabolic alterations pertinent to schizophrenic disease
   can be primed by an environmental risk factor associated with the
   disorder, namely prenatal exposure to immune challenge. We used a
   well-established mouse model of prenatal immune challenge induced by
   maternal gestational treatment with poly(I:C)
   (="polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid"), an analog of
   double-stranded RNA that stimulates a cytokine-associated viral-like
   acute phase response. Metabolic effects were studied using
   high-resolution computed tomography and fully automated indirect
   calorimetry system, along with an oral glucose tolerance test and plasma
   cytokine and corticosterone measurements. We found that prenatal immune
   activation caused altered glycemic regulation and abnormal ingestive
   behavior in periadolescence and led to an adult onset of excess visceral
   and subcutaneous fat deposition. These effects were accompanied by
   age-dependent changes in peripheral secretion of proinflammatory
   (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) and T cell
   related (IL-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma) cytokines and by increased
   release of the stress hormone corticosterone in periadolescence. Our
   findings show that schizophrenia-relevant metabolic and physiological
   abnormalities can be primed by prenatal viral-like immune activation,
   but at the same time, our study emphasizes that this environmental
   insult is unlikely to precipitate the full spectrum of metabolic and
   immunological changes pertinent to chronic schizophrenic disease.

TI Nucleosomal composition at the centromere: a numbers game
SO CHROMOSOME RESEARCH
AB The Centromere is a unique chromosomal locus where the kinetochore is
   formed to mediate faithful chromosome partitioning, thus maintaining
   ploidy during cell division. Centromere identity is inherited via an
   epigenetic mechanism involving a histone H3 variant, called centromere
   protein A (CENP-A) which replaces H3 in centromeric chromatin. In spite
   of extensive efforts in field of centromere biology during the past
   decade, controversy persists over the structural nature of the
   CENP-A-containing epigenetic mark, both at nucleosomal and chromatin
   levels. Here, we review recent findings and hypotheses regarding the
   structure of CENP-A-containing complexes.

TI An Experimental Test of the Capture-Restraint Protocol for Estimating
   the Acute Stress Response
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY
AB Stress-induced increases in glucocorticoids (GCs) modulate behavior and
   are key in directing energy reserves. The capture-restraint protocol was
   developed to experimentally stimulate and quantify the magnitude of the
   acute stress response by comparing baseline GC levels with those
   collected after restraining a subject for a period of time, typically 30
   min. This protocol has been used extensively in the field and lab, yet
   few studies have investigated whether it parallels
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation under natural acute
   stressors. We examined the hypothesis that acute stress from the
   capture-restraint protocol accurately mimics the adrenocortical response
   induced by a natural acute stressor. Using wild-caught rock pigeons
   Columba livia in a repeated-measures design, we compared plasma
   corticosterone (CORT) concentrations at baseline, after exposure to
   acute capture-restraint (30 min in a cloth bag), after tethering in a
   harness (30 min), and after a real but nonlethal attack by a predatory
   raptor. As found in previous studies, the capture-restraint treatment
   significantly increased CORT levels of pigeons compared with baseline.
   However, we also found that when pigeons were exposed to an attack by a
   raptor, their CORT levels were more than twice as high compared with the
   capture-restraint treatment. Our results provide evidence that an
   authentic acute stressor can activate the HPA axis to a greater extent
   than the capture-restraint protocol and also suggest that real predation
   attempts can have a significant effect on acute stress levels of wild
   birds.

TI Tracheal occlusion conditioning causes stress, anxiety and neural state
   changes in conscious rats
SO EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB New Findings center dot What is the central question of this study?
   Airway obstructions appear to evoke stress and to cause compensatory
   behaviours; individuals with respiratory obstructive diseases experience
   affective disorders. Respiratory patterns can be conditioned, but it is
   unknown whether healthy animals develop stress or anxiety following
   respiratory occlusion conditioning and whether persistent neural changes
   are involved in that development. center dot What is the main finding
   and its importance? Respiratory occlusion conditioning caused both
   stress and anxiety in healthy rats, which were accompanied by increased
   basal neural activity in important respiratory, stress and
   discriminative and affective sensory processing centres. Affective
   disorders may follow the development of a respiratory obstructive
   disease through the modulation of basal activity in specific neural
   regions. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that
   mechanical loads to breathing are stressful stimuli and evoke
   compensatory behaviours. Conditioning of stressful stimuli is known to
   cause changes in basal stress levels and behaviour. Individuals with
   respiratory obstructive diseases repeatedly experience bouts of airway
   obstruction, which may act as a form of conditioning, and often have
   affective disorders, such as anxiety and depression. It is unknown
   whether the development of affective disorders in these individuals
   results from the unexpected recurring respiratory perturbations. To
   investigate this possibility, we developed a model to elicit tracheal
   occlusion (TO) in conscious rats and exposed them to 10 days of TO
   conditioning. We hypothesized that healthy, conscious animals exposed to
   TO conditioning would develop stress and anxiety and would have
   modulated neural activity in respiratory, stress, discriminative and
   affective neural regions. Following TO conditioning, rats had increased
   basal corticosterone levels, greater adrenal weights and elevated
   anxiety levels compared with animals not receiving TO. Significant
   increases in cytochrome oxidase staining were found in brainstem
   respiratory nuclei, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe, thalamus and
   insular cortex. These results suggest that healthy animals develop
   stress and anxiety responses to respiratory load conditioning via
   inescapable tracheal occlusions, which may be mediated through state
   changes in specific brain nuclei.

TI Selenium intake and selenium blood levels: a novel food frequency
   questionnaire
SO WIENER KLINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB The present study was undertaken to estimate the selenium intake of
   thyroid patients and investigate the possible relation between thyroid
   abnormalities and the selenium intake.
   The selenium intake through foods and the nutritional habits of thyroid
   patients in general were analyzed. Total 212 subjects from thyroid
   outpatient clinic of two state hospitals were interviewed. Among 212
   subjects, 21 had no thyroid abnormality and served as controls. A food
   frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to define the individual
   selenium intakes. From five different food groups, a total of 15
   selenium-rich foods were selected, which are obtainable in Austria. The
   clinical and nutritional data were analyzed.
   Animal products such as milk and meat (pork, beef and poultry) played
   the most important role for the selenium supply in the Austrian diet.
   The intake of selenium in 86 % of the total study population was below
   the estimated average requirement (EAR). The selenium level was higher
   in euthyroid people compared with hypothyroid patients.
   The developed FFQ is a tool to estimate the selenium intake in
   individuals, as it could be shown in this study. A significant positive
   correlation between selenium intake and blood selenium level was noted.
   These results must be confirmed by further studies in larger patient
   population.

TI Effects of water restriction on reproductive physiology and affiliative
   behavior in an opportunistically-breeding and monogamous songbird, the
   zebra finch
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Wild zebra finches form long-term monogamous pair-bonds that are
   actively maintained year-round, even when not in breeding condition.
   These desert finches are opportunistic breeders, and breeding is highly
   influenced by unpredictable rainfall. Their high levels of affiliation
   and complex breeding patterns make zebra finches an excellent model in
   which to study the endocrine regulation of affiliation. Here, we
   compared zebra finch pairs that were provided with water ad libitum
   (control) or water restricted. We examined (1) reproductive physiology,
   (2) pair-maintenance behaviors in several contexts, and (3) circulating
   and brain steroid levels. In females, water restriction profoundly
   reduced largest ovarian follicle size, ovary size, oviduct size, and egg
   laying. In males, water restriction had no effect on testes size but
   decreased systemic testosterone levels. However, in the hypothalamus,
   local testosterone and estradiol levels were unaffected by water
   restriction in both sexes. Systemic and local levels of the androgen
   precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were also unaffected by water
   restriction. Lastly, in three different behavioral paradigms, we
   examined a variety of pair-maintenance behaviors, and none were reduced
   by water restriction. Taken together, these correlational data are
   consistent with the hypothesis that local production of sex steroids in
   the brain promotes the expression of pair-maintenance behaviors in
   non-breeding zebra finches. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Potential pitfalls of needle tract effects on repeat thyroid fine-needle
   aspiration
SO CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a screening and diagnostic
   tool used in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Its use has resulted in
   an increase in the ratio of malignant versus benign thyroid nodules
   undergoing surgical excision. However, the FNA procedure produces some
   histological and cytologic alterations, which may lead to
   misinterpretation on repeat FNA. The goal of the current study was to
   characterize FNA-induced morphological alterations and their potential
   influence on interpretations in repeat FNA specimens. METHOD:
   Thyroidectomy specimens that had benign histological diagnoses and for
   which previous FNA specimens were available were retrieved. The
   FNA-induced histological alterations were evaluated and grouped based on
   the interval between the FNA procedure and surgical excision. Repeat
   thyroid FNA specimens with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical
   cells/follicular lesion were reviewed. Worrisome cytologic features that
   might occur after the previous FNA procedure were discussed. RESULTS:
   Needle tracts were identified in 68 of the 96 thyroidectomy specimens
   studied. FNA-induced histological alterations included hemorrhage,
   granulation, exuberant fibroblastic reaction, reactive follicular cells,
   infarction, and scarring. The presence of plump endothelial cells,
   myofibroblasts, and, particularly, reactive follicular cells with
   nuclear grooving and nuclear clearing are potential pitfalls in repeat
   FNA and these changes are reported to peak within 20 to 40 days after
   the FNA procedure. Sixteen of 152 repeat FNA cases were diagnosed as
   atypical cells/follicular lesion, and FNA-induced changes might have
   contributed to the diagnosis in 2 of these 16 cases. CONCLUSIONS:
   Cytologists should be aware of atypical cellular changes caused by
   previous FNA procedures. Although uncommon, these changes may become
   potential pitfalls in the cytologic diagnosis of repeat thyroid FNA
   specimens. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2013. (c) 2012 American Cancer

TI Short-term and latent post-settlement effects associated with elevated
   temperature and oxidative stress on larvae from the coral Porites
   astreoides
SO CORAL REEFS
AB Coral reefs across the Caribbean are undergoing unprecedented rates of
   decline in coral cover during the last three decades, and coral
   recruitment is one potential process that could aid the recovery of
   coral populations. To better understand the effects of climate change on
   coral larval ecology, the larvae of Porites astreoides were studied to
   determine the immediate and post-settlement effects of elevated
   temperature and associated oxidative stress. Larvae of Porites
   astreoides were exposed to 27 A degrees C (ambient) and +3.0 A degrees C
   (elevated temperature) seawater for a short duration of 24 h; then, a
   suite of physiological parameters were measured to determine the extent
   of sublethal stress. Following the +3.0 A degrees C treatment, larvae
   did not show a significant difference in maximum quantum yield of PSII
   (F (v)/F (m)) or respiratory demand when compared to controls maintained
   at 27 A degrees C. The addition of micromolar concentrations of hydrogen
   peroxide did not impact respiration or photochemical efficiency.
   Catalase activity in the larvae increased (> 60 %) following exposure to
   elevated temperature when compared to the controls. Short-term larval
   survival and settlement and metamorphosis were not affected by increased
   temperature or the H2O2 treatment. However, the settled spat that were
   exposed to elevated temperature underwent a 99 % reduction in survival
   compared to 90 % reduction for the control spat when examined 24 days
   following the deployment of 4-day-old settled spat on settlement tiles
   in the field. These results show that short-term exposure to some
   stressors might have small impacts on coral physiology, and no effects
   on larval survival, settlement and metamorphosis. However, due to
   post-settlement mortality, these stressors can cause a significant
   reduction in coral recruitment.

TI Systematic Use of Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Neuromonitoring Changes the
   Operative Strategy in Planned Bilateral Thyroidectomy
SO THYROID
AB Background: One of the worst complications in thyroid surgery is
   bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, which can lead to
   transient or definitive tracheotomy.
   Methods: We implemented a strict standard operative procedure beginning
   in January 2010 and modified our operative procedure. In all patients
   undergoing bilateral operation, we begin with the largest side or with
   the cancerous/suspicious side without dissecting the contralateral side.
   If the intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) signal is lost after
   stimulation of the vagus nerve at the end of the first side, we stop the
   procedure after the unilateral lobectomy, even if the recurrent nerve is
   anatomically intact and regardless of malignancy. If the IONM signal is
   lost, serial laryngoscopies are performed until recovery or definitive
   recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy is demonstrated. We report here our
   results in patients with loss of the IONM signal after lobectomy and
   discuss the medical implications for benign and malignant thyroid
   conditions.
   Results: Since January 2010, the operation has been stopped at the first
   side in 9 out of 220 planned bilateral thyroidectomies. There were five
   benign thyroid conditions and four thyroid cancers, including three
   papillary thyroid cancers and one bilateral medullary thyroid cancer in
   a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a. In two patients, it was
   a false-positive IONM loss. One of these two patients had the other lobe
   removed at day 3. In seven patients the laryngoscopy demonstrated total
   or partial laryngeal nerve palsy at day 1, but the recurrent nerve
   function recovered fully in all patients between 1 and 4 months
   postoperatively. All cancer patients were operated on the other side
   within 3 days to 3 months; one patient with a benign condition is being
   followed conservatively. One of the eight re-operated patients had
   transient recurrent nerve palsy postoperatively.
   Conclusion: In our opinion, the systematic use of IONM and the change in
   operative strategy will lead to an almost 0% rate of bilateral laryngeal
   nerve palsy, at least in benign thyroid conditions. A loss of signal
   after the first side should prompt a halt in the procedure, even in
   cases of malignancies.

TI Iridophores and Not Carotenoids Account for Chromatic Variation of
   Carotenoid-Based Coloration in Common Lizards (Lacerta vivipara)
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
AB Carotenoids typically need reflective background components to shine.
   Such components, iridophores, leucophores, and keratin-and
   collagen-derived structures, are generally assumed to show no or little
   environmental variability. Here, we investigate the origin of
   environmentally induced variation in the carotenoid-based ventral
   coloration of male common lizards (Lacerta vivipara) by investigating
   the effects of dietary carotenoids and corticosterone on both
   carotenoid-and background-related reflectance. We observed a general
   negative chromatic change that was prevented by beta-carotene
   supplementation. However, chromatic changes did not result from changes
   in carotenoid-related reflectance or skin carotenoid content but from
   changes in background-related reflectance that may have been mediated by
   vitamin A(1). An in vitro experiment showed that the encountered
   chromatic changes most likely resulted from changes in iridophore
   reflectance. Our findings demonstrate that chromatic variation in
   carotenoid-based ornaments may not exclusively reflect differences in
   integumentary carotenoid content and, hence, in qualities linked to
   carotenoid deposition (e. g., foraging ability, immune response, or
   antioxidant capacity). Moreover, skin carotenoid content and
   carotenoid-related reflectance were related to male color polymorphism,
   suggesting that carotenoid-based coloration of male common lizards is a
   multicomponent signal, with iridophores reflecting environmental
   conditions and carotenoids reflecting genetically based color morphs.

TI Nuclear Myosin 1c Facilitates the Chromatin Modifications Required to
   Activate rRNA Gene Transcription and Cell Cycle Progression
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Actin and nuclear myosin 1c (NM1) cooperate in RNA polymerase I (pol I)
   transcription. NM1 is also part of a multiprotein assembly, B-WICH,
   which is involved in transcription. This assembly contains the chromatin
   remodeling complex WICH with its subunits WSTF and SNF2h. We report here
   that NM1 binds SNF2h with enhanced affinity upon impairment of the
   actin-binding function. ChIP analysis revealed that NM1, SNF2h, and
   actin gene occupancies are cell cycle-dependent and require intact motor
   function. At the onset of cell division, when transcription is
   temporarily blocked, B-WICH is disassembled due to WSTF phosphorylation,
   to be reassembled on the active gene at exit from mitosis. NM1 gene
   knockdown and motor function inhibition, or stable expression of NM1
   mutants that do not interact with actin or chromatin, overall repressed
   rRNA synthesis by stalling pol I at the gene promoter, led to chromatin
   alterations by changing the state of H3K9 acetylation at gene promoter,
   and delayed cell cycle progression. These results suggest a unique
   structural role for NM1 in which the interaction with SNF2h stabilizes
   B-WICH at the gene promoter and facilitates recruitment of the HAT PCAF.
   This leads to a permissive chromatin structure required for
   transcription activation.

TI Origins of an Urban Crisis: The Restructuring of the San Francisco Bay
   Area and the Geography of Foreclosure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
AB Communities on the fringes of the American metropolis have recently
   garnered attention as the centers of the foreclosure crisis and its
   aftermath. On the one hand, this attention to the urban nature of the
   crisis is welcome, as the metamorphosis of the mortgage fiasco into a
   financial crisis-cum-global economic meltdown turned popular attention
   away from the urban roots of this calamity. But this emphasis on the
   exurbs as the site of crisis lends itself to the misconception that
   they, rather than the restructuring of the metropolis as a whole, are
   the sole source of the crisis. This article works across multiple scales
   to examine how three interwoven factors demographics, policy and capital
   each reacted to the San Francisco Bay Area landscape inherited at the
   end of the 1970s, affecting the region in new ways, leaving some places
   thriving and others struggling with foreclosure, which leads to
   plummeting property values and the deep uncertainty of the current
   American metropolis. This restructuring can be seen as the convergence
   between the unresolved urban crisis of the postwar era and the various
   reactions in the neoliberal era. It demands a reimagining of both
   planning and geography, especially from the left.

TI Prenatal stress effects on emotion regulation differ by genotype and sex

SO DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY
AB Behavioral effects of different prenatal stress (PNS) schedules were
   examined in prepubertal depressive/anxious-like WKY and control Wistar
   rats. Pregnant dams received 1?hr daily restraint stress on gestational
   days 1420 or on 7 randomly scheduled days, or remained undisturbed.
   Offspring were tested during postnatal days 2935 in social play, forced
   swim-test, open field, and novelty tests. PNS induced an increase in
   anxiety-like behaviors in WKY, particularly in females, while seemingly
   reducing depressive-like behavior in the swim test. However, very high
   post-stress corticosterone levels were found, suggesting that the
   reductions in swim-test immobility reflect an extremely over-responsive
   HPA axis, rather than normalization in stress reactivity leading to a
   less depressive-like profile. In Wistar, PNS produced weight loss,
   hyperactivity and risk taking behavior, especially in males. The results
   support the importance of the environment during gestation and its
   interaction with sex and genetics on long-term anxiety and depressive
   like behaviors. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 55:

   renal neoplasms indicates a role of SIX2 in tumorigenesis. This study
   focuses therefore on the investigation of SIX2 in different renal
   neoplasms and the mode and consequences of SIX2 activation. Expression
   of SIX2 was determined in renal cell carcinomas, nephroblastomas, and
   dysplastic kidneys using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction. Its potential mode of activation was assessed
   by measuring upstream activators by quantitative real-time polymerase
   chain reaction and the level of methylation of the promoter region by
   quantitative DNA methylation analysis. Consequences of SIX2 activation
   were investigated by overexpressing SIX2 in a cell line. Forty-seven of
   49 renal clear cell carcinomas showed nuclear staining of SIX2, whereas
   all papillary carcinomas were negative. In nephroblastomas of various
   subtypes blastema showed a significant up-regulation (P < .01) and a
   strong nuclear protein expression of SIX2 in contrast to negative
   epithelial and mesenchymal areas. 11 cases of dysplastic kidneys were
   entirely negative. Upstream activators of SIX2 indicated an activation
   of the signal transduction pathway in most samples. No difference of
   promoter methylation status was observed between blastema and epithelial
   structures. A significantly higher percentage of cells in the S-phase
   and an increased migration were detected in the cell-line overexpressing
   SIX2. Our study suggests that activation of SIX2 might contribute to the
   pathogenesis of renal clear cell carcinomas and nephroblastomas. SIX2
   also appears to be a valuable marker for minimal residual blastema
   contributing to the prognosis of nephroblastomas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI Diet-induced obesity promotes depressive-like behaviour that is
   associated with neural adaptations in brain reward circuitry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY
AB BACKGROUND: The biological mechanisms that link the development of
   depression to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes remain
   obscure. Dopamine-and plasticity-related signalling in mesolimbic reward
   circuitry is implicated in the pathophysiology and aetiology of
   depression.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a palatable high-fat diet (HFD) on
   depressive-like behaviour and biochemical alterations in brain reward
   circuitry in order to understand the neural processes that may
   contribute to the development of depression in the context of
   diet-induced obesity (DIO).
   METHODS: Adult male C57Bl6 mice were placed on a HFD or
   ingredient-matched, low-fat diet for 12 weeks. At the end of the diet
   regimen, we assessed anxiety and depressive-like behaviour,
   corticosterone levels and biochemical changes in the midbrain and limbic
   brain regions. Nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and
   ventral tegmental area dissections were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
   immunoblotting using antibodies against D1A receptor, D2 receptor,
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phospho-DARPP-32(thr75),
   phospho-CREB and Delta FosB.
   RESULTS: HFD mice showed significant decreases in open arm time and
   centre time activity in elevated plus maze and open field tasks,
   respectively, and increased immobility (behavioural despair) in the
   forced swim test. Corticosterone levels following acute restraint stress
   were substantially elevated in HFD mice. HFD mice had significantly
   higher D2R, BDNF and Delta FosB, but reduced D1R, protein expression in
   the NAc. Notably, the expression of BDNF in both the NAc and DLS and
   phospho-CREB in the DLS was positively correlated with behavioural
   despair.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that chronic consumption of
   high-fat food and obesity induce plasticity-related changes in reward
   circuitry that are associated with a depressive-like phenotype. As
   increases in striatal BDNF and CREB activity are well implicated in
   depressive behaviour and reward, we suggest these signalling molecules
   may mediate the effects of high-fat feeding and DIO to promote negative
   emotional states and depressive-like symptomology. International Journal

TI Epigenome-wide association study in the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Turin) identifies novel
   genetic loci associated with smoking
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB A single cytosineguanine dinucleotide (CpG) site within coagulation
   factor II (thrombin) receptor-like 3 (F2RL3) was recently found to be
   hypomethylated in peripheral blood genomic DNA from smokers compared
   with former and non-smokers. We performed two epigenome-wide association
   studies (EWAS) nested in a prospective healthy cohort using the Illumina
   450K Methylation Beadchip. The two populations consisted of matched
   pairs of healthy individuals (n 374), of which half went on to develop
   breast or colon cancer. The association was analysed between methylation
   and smoking status, as well as cancer risk. In addition to the same
   locus in F2RL3, we report several loci that are hypomethylated in
   smokers compared with former and non-smokers, including an intragenic
   region of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor gene (AHRR;
   cg05575921, P 2.31 10(15); effect size 1417), an intergenic CpG island
   on 2q37.1 (cg21566642, P 3.73 10(13); effect size 12) and a further
   intergenic region at 6p21.33 (cg06126421, P 4.96 10(11), effect size
   78). Bisulphite pyrosequencing validated six loci in a further
   independent population of healthy individuals (n 180). Methylation
   levels in AHRR were also significantly decreased (P 0.001) and
   expression increased (P 0.0047) in the lung tissue of current smokers
   compared with non-smokers. This was further validated in a mouse model
   of smoke exposure. We observed an association with breast cancer risk
   for the 2q37.1 locus (P 0.003, adjusted for the smoking status), but not
   for the other loci associated with smoking. These data show that smoking
   has a direct effect on the epigenome in lung tissue, which is also
   detectable in peripheral blood DNA and may contribute to cancer risk.

TI Rsf-1, a chromatin remodelling protein, interacts with cyclin E1 and
   promotes tumour development
SO JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Chromosome 11q13.5 containing RSF1 (HBXAP), a gene involved in chromatin
   remodelling, is amplified in several human cancers including ovarian
   carcinoma. Our previous studies demonstrated requirement of Rsf-1 for
   cell survival in cancer cells, which contributed to tumour progression;
   however, its role in tumourigenesis has not yet been elucidated. In this
   study, we co-immunoprecipitated proteins with Rsf-1 followed by
   nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and identified cyclin E1, besides
   SNF2H, as one of the major Rsf-1 interacting proteins. Like RSF1, CCNE1
   is frequently amplified in ovarian cancer, and both Rsf-1 and cyclin E1
   were found co-up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues. Ectopic expression
   of Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 in non-tumourigenic TP53mut RK3E cells led to an
   increase in cellular proliferation and tumour formation by activating
   cyclin E1-associated kinase (CDK2). Tumourigenesis was not detected if
   either cyclin E1 or Rsf-1 was expressed, or they were expressed in a
   TP53wt background. Domain mapping showed that cyclin E1 interacted with
   the first 441 amino acids of Rsf-1. Ectopic expression of this truncated
   domain significantly suppressed G1/S-phase transition, cellular
   proliferation, and tumour formation of RK3E-p53R175H/Rsf-1/cyclin E1
   cells. The above findings suggest that Rsf-1 interacts and collaborates
   with cyclin E1 in neoplastic transformation and TP53 mutations are a
   prerequisite for tumour-promoting functions of the RSF/cyclin E1
   complex.

TI Effects of continuously enhanced corticotropin releasing factor
   expression within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis on conditioned
   and unconditioned anxiety
SO MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB The lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST),
   which forms part of the circuitry regulating fear and anxiety, contains
   a large number of neurons expressing corticotropin releasing factor
   (CRF), a neuropeptide that has a prominent role in the etiology of
   fear-and anxiety-related psychopathologies. Stress increases CRF
   expression within BNST neurons, implicating these cells in stress-and
   anxiety-related behaviors. These experiments examined the effect of
   chronically enhanced CRF expression within BNST neurons on conditioned
   and unconditioned anxiety-related behavior by using a lentiviral vector
   containing a promoter that targets CRF gene overexpression (OE) to
   CRFergic cells. We found that BNST CRF-OE did not affect unconditioned
   anxiety-like responses in the elevated plus maze or basal acoustic
   startle amplitude. CRF-OE induced before training weakened sustained
   fear (conditioned anxiety); when induced after conditioning, CRF-OE
   increased expression of the conditioned emotional memory. Increased BNST
   CRF expression did not affect plasma corticosterone concentration but
   did decrease CRFR1 receptor density within the BNST and CRFR2 receptor
   density within the dorsal portion of the caudal dorsal raphe nucleus.
   These data raise the possibility that the observed behavioral effects
   may be mediated by enhanced CRF receptor signaling or compensatory
   changes in CRF receptor density within these structures. Together, these
   studies demonstrate that CRF neurons within the lateral BNST modulate
   conditioned anxiety-like behaviors and also suggest that enhanced CRF
   expression within these neurons may contribute to inappropriate
   regulation of emotional memories. Molecular Psychiatry (2013) 18,

TI Adrenal hormone deprivation affects macrophage catecholamine metabolism
   and 2-adrenoceptor density, but not propranolol stimulation of tumour
   necrosis factor- production
SO EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB New Findings center dot What is the central question of this study?
   Glucocorticoids modulate extraglandular catecholamine metabolism and
   adrenoceptor expression in many cell types. Catecholamines modulate the
   production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages. It was hypothesized
   that adrenal hormones affect tumour necrosis factor- production in rat
   macrophages by altering the autocrine/paracrine action of
   catecholamines. center dot What is the main finding and its importance?
   In rat macrophages, adrenalectomy increased tyrosine hydroxylase
   expression, decreased monoamine oxidase-A mRNA expression (due to the
   absence of adrenal catecholamines and glucocorticoids, respectively) and
   augmented 2-adrenoceptor expression (due to lack of adrenal
   catecholamines). However, notwithstanding these changes, propranolol
   treatment increased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumour necrosis
   factor- production in macrophages from adrenalectomized and non-operated
   rats to a similar extent. Catecholamines modulate the production of
   inflammatory mediators by macrophages in an autocrine/paracrine manner.
   They also tune 2-adrenoceptor expression. Glucocorticoids influence
   catecholamine metabolism and adrenoceptor expression in many cell types.
   We hypothesized that adrenal hormones affect the production of tumour
   necrosis factor- (TNF-) and NO by macrophages by altering the modulatory
   influence of catecholamines. To prove the hypothesis, peritoneal exudate
   macrophages from propranolol-treated non-operated and adrenalectomized
   rats and from corticosterone-supplemented adrenalectomized rats were
   examined for lipopolysaccharide-stimulated NO and TNF- production in
   vitro and for expression of 2-adrenoceptors and major
   catecholamine-metabolizing enzymes. Glucocorticoid deprivation increased
   NO production by macrophages, whereas 4 days of propranolol treatment
   was ineffective in this respect. However, propranolol treatment, via
   2-adrenoceptor blockade, increased production of TNF- by macrophages in
   both non-operated and adrenalectomized rats (showing dramatically
   enhanced TNF- production due to a lack of circulating glucocorticoids)
   for the same value. The expression of 2-adrenoceptor was increased in
   peritoneal macrophages that were freshly isolated from non-operated,
   propranolol-treated and adrenalectomized rats (due to adrenal
   catecholamine deficiency). Propranolol did not affect macrophage
   2-adrenoceptor expression in adrenalectomized rats. Given that
   propranolol increased the density of macrophage tyrosine hydroxylase
   expression only in non-operated rats and affected the mRNA expression of
   monoamine oxidase-A in neither non-operated nor adrenalectomized
   animals, a significant influence of propranolol on peritoneal exudate
   cell noradrenaline content was found only in non-operated rats. A lack
   of circulating adrenal hormones also affected noradrenaline metabolism
   and content in peritoneal exudate cells including macrophages.
   Collectively, despite differences in the abundance of macrophage
   catecholamine2-adrenoceptor system components and in the TNF- response
   to lipopolysaccharide between adrenalectomized and non-operated rats,
   propranolol increased TNF- production by the same amount in macrophages
   from these two groups of animals.

TI Different chromatin interfaces of the Drosophila dosage compensation
   complex revealed by high-shear ChIP-seq
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Transcriptional enhancement of X-linked genes to compensate for the sex
   chromosome monosomy in Drosophila males is brought about by a
   ribonucleoprotein assembly called Male-Specific-Lethal or Dosage
   Compensation Complex (MSL-DCC). This machinery is formed in male flies
   and specifically associates with active genes on the X chromosome. After
   assembly at dedicated high-affinity "entry'' sites (HAS) on the X
   chromosome, the complex distributes to the nearby active chromatin.
   High-resolution, genome-wide mapping of the MSL-DCC subunits by
   chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on oligonucleotide tiling arrays
   suggests a rather homogenous spreading of the intact complex onto
   transcribed chromatin. Coupling ChIP to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq)
   promises to map the chromosomal interactions of the DCC with improved
   resolution. We present ChIP-seq binding profiles for all complex
   subunits, including the first description of the RNA helicase MLE
   binding pattern. Exploiting the preferential representation of direct
   chromatin contacts upon high-energy shearing, we report a surprising
   functional and topological separation of MSL protein contacts at three
   classes of chromosomal binding sites. Furthermore, precise determination
   of DNA fragment lengths by paired-end ChIP-seq allows decrypting of the
   local complex architecture. Primary contacts of MSL-2 and MLE define HAS
   for the DCC. In contrast, association of the DCC with actively
   transcribed gene bodies is mediated by MSL-3 binding to nucleosomes. We
   identify robust MSL-1/MOF binding at a fraction of active promoters
   genome-wide. Correlation analyses suggest that this association reflects
   a function outside dosage compensation. Our comprehensive analysis
   provides a new level of information on different interaction modes of a
   multiprotein complex at distinct regions within the genome.

TI Dysregulated miR-363 affects head and neck cancer invasion and
   metastasis by targeting podoplanin
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY
AB Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterised by an
   elevated capacity for tumour invasion and lymph node metastasis and the
   cause remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs
   can regulate the evolution of malignant behaviours by regulating
   multiple target genes. In this study, we have first confirmed that
   miR-363 is down-regulated in HNSCC tissues with lymph node metastasis
   and cell lines with highly invasive capacity. We used bioinformatics,
   cellular and molecular methods to predict and prove that miR-363
   directly targeted to podoplanin (PDPN) and caused up-regulation of PDPN
   in HNSCC. MSP assay showed that DNA promoter methylation was involved in
   silencing the miR-363 in HNSCC. Furthermore, we provided evidence to
   demonstrate that PDPN dysregulation caused by down-regulation of miR-363
   contributes to HNSCC invasion and metastasis. These data reveal a key
   role of miR-363-PDPN in HNSCC metastasis and support biological and
   clinical links between miR-363-PDPN and HNSCC. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Comparison of performance and welfare of single-caged and group-housed
   rabbit does
SO ANIMAL
AB Although rabbit does are generally single housed on rabbit farms
   worldwide, it has been suggested by some specialists and recommendation
   of organic rabbit production systems that group housing of does is more
   comfortable and similar to the living conditions of the European wild
   rabbits. The aim of this experiment was to compare production of
   single-caged (S) and group-housed does (G). The S does were housed in
   commercial rabbit cages (floor area 0.32 m(2) and 0.3 m high). In
   treatment G, four does and one buck were housed in four pens measuring
   7.7 m(2) (half of the floor was deep litter and the other half was
   plastic slat), with four nest boxes in each pen (n = 516). In treatment
   S, approximately half of the does (n = 18) were inseminated 2 days after
   kindling (S-33), whereas in the remaining does (n = 516) AI was done 11
   days after kindling (S-42). A single-batch system (all of the does in
   the group were inseminated on the same day) was used in both S
   treatments. Kindling rates were 77.6%, 85.2% and 45.6% in treatments
   S-33, S-42 and G, respectively (P < 0.05). During the experiment, the
   percentage of does that kindled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 times were 17%, 25%,
   17%, 25%, 17% and 0% (G); 0%, 0%, 0%, 8%, 69% and 23% (S-33); and 0%,
   0%, 17%, 58% and 25% (S-42, in this treatment does had a maximum of four
   kindlings). There were no significant differences among treatments for
   litter size. In treatments S-33, S-42 and G, suckling mortality was
   14.0%, 15.2% and 38.5%, respectively (P < 0.001); survival of does was
   71%, 81% and 50% (P = 0.084); and faecal corticosterone concentrations
   were 61, 54 and 175 nmol/g (P < 0.001). The high mortality of kits was
   associated with stress and aggressive behaviour of does, including
   scratching, biting or killing the kits, which resulted in the high rates
   of mortality and culling, as well as shorter lifespan of does. Because
   of high stress, increased mortality and morbidity, and low productivity,
   group housing of rabbit does resulted in poorer animal welfare and
   increased production costs, and therefore is not recommended.

TI Sex differences in stress-induced social withdrawal: Independence from
   adult gonadal hormones and inhibition of female phenotype by corncob
   bedding
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB There is compelling evidence for important sex differences in behavioral
   and hormonal responses to psychosocial stress. Here we examined the
   effects of gonadal hormones on behavioral responses to social defeat
   stress in monogamous California mice (Peromyscus californicus). Three
   episodes of social defeat induced social withdrawal in intact females
   but not males. Gonadectomy blocked corticosterone responses to defeat in
   females and sensitized male corticosterone responses. However,
   gonadectomy had no effects on social interaction behavior, suggesting
   that social withdrawal is not dependent on gonadal hormones in the adult
   California mouse. In contrast, defeat reduced exploratory behavior in
   the open field test for intact but not castrated males. We also examined
   the effects of social defeat on social interaction behavior when
   California mice were raised on corncob bedding, which has estrogenic
   properties. In this dataset of over 300 mice, we observed that social
   defeat did not induce social withdrawal when females were raised on
   corncob bedding. This finding suggests that the use of corncob in rodent
   studies could mask important sex differences in the effects of stress on
   brain and behavior. Although gonadal hormones do not affect social
   withdrawal behavior in adults, our data suggest that hormones may act
   earlier in development to induce a more resilient social phenotype. (C)

TI Insights Into the Molecular Mechanism for 2 Diabetes Susceptibility at
   the KCNQ1 Locus From Temporal Changes in Imprinting Status in Human
   Islets
SO DIABETES
AB The molecular basis of type 2 diabetes predisposition at most
   established susceptibility loci remains poorly understood. KCNQ1 maps
   within the 11p15.5 imprinted domain, a region with an established role
   in congenital growth phenotypes. Variants intronic to KCNQ1 influence
   diabetes susceptibility when maternally inherited. By use of
   quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of human adult islet and fetal
   pancreas samples, we investigated the imprinting status of regional
   transcripts and aimed to determine whether type 2 diabetes risk alleles
   influence regional DNA methylation and gene expression. The results
   demonstrate that gene expression patterns differ by developmental stage.
   CDKN1C showed monoallelic expression in both adult and fetal tissue,
   whereas PHLDA2, SLC22A18, and SLC22A18AS were biallelically expressed in
   both tissues. Temporal changes in imprinting were observed for KCNQ1 and
   KCNQ10T1, with monoallelic expression in fetal tissues and biallelic
   expression in adult samples. Genotype at the type 2 diabetes risk
   variant rs2237895 influenced methylation levels of regulatory sequence
   in fetal pancreas but without demonstrable effects on gene expression.
   We demonstrate that CDKN1C, KCNQ1, and KCNQ10T1 are most likely to
   mediate diabetes susceptibility at the KCNQ1 locus and identify temporal
   differences in imprinting status and methylation effects, suggesting
   that diabetes risk effects may be mediated in early development.

TI Companions reverse stressor-induced decreases in neurogenesis and
   cocaine conditioning possibly by restoring BDNF and NGF levels in
   dentate gyrus
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The presence of companions can reverse the stressor-induced decrease in
   neurogenesis in mouse dentate gyrus (DG). In this study, we decided to
   study the underlying mechanisms of the companions' protective effect and
   to assess whether two DG neurogenesis-related memories, cocaine-induced
   conditioned place preference (CPP) and spatial memory, can be affected
   by our stressor and companions. Neurotrophin levels in DG were measured,
   in this regard, to reveal their roles in mediating the stressors' and
   companions' effect. We found that the stressor did not affect NT-3 but
   acutely decreased NGF and BONE levels in DG. The presence of companions
   abolished these stressor-decreased NGF and BONE levels. Neither the
   stressor nor the presence of companions affected TrkA, TrkB or TrkC
   expression in DG. Pre-exposure to the stressor rendered deficits in
   cocaine-induced CPP and spatial memory, while companions reversed the
   stressor-decreased cocaine-induced CPP. Intra-ventricular infusion with
   K252a, a mixed TrkA and TrkB antagonist, did not affect the protective
   effects of companions on local NGF, BONE levels in DG, but abolished the
   companions' protective effects against the stressor-decreased DG
   neurogenesis and cocaine-induced CPP. Systemic pretreatment with
   7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a selective TrkB agonist, did not affect
   baseline, the stressor-stimulated corticosterone (CORT) secretion or
   local NGF, BDNF levels in DG, but in part mimicked companions'
   protective effects. These results, taken together, indicate that
   stressor-decreased NGF and BDNF levels in DG could be involved in the
   stressor-decreased DG neurogenesis and cocaine conditioning. The
   presence of companions reverses the stressor-decreased DG neurogenesis
   and cocaine conditioning possibly by restoring BONE and NGF levels in
   DG. (C)12 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Association of Socioeconomic Status with Iodine Supply and Thyroid
   Disorders in Northeast Germany
SO THYROID
AB Objectives: Studies on the potential association of socioeconomic status
   with iodine supply and the risk for thyroid disorders from developed
   countries are sparse. Socioeconomic status, however, may particularly
   impact the efficiency of iodine prophylaxis programs, which are based on
   the voluntary principle. This study aims to investigate whether the
   socioeconomic status is cross-sectionally and longitudinally related to
   low urinary excretion or thyroid disorders in the population of
   northeast Germany.
   Methods: Data of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania were
   used. The study population comprised 4056 adults for cross-sectional and
   2860 adults for longitudinal analyses. Assessment of socioeconomic
   status comprised different scales of education, income, employment, and
   occupation. Thyroid-related outcomes included urinary iodine excretion,
   serum thyrotropin, and sonographically defined goiter and nodules.
   Statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders.
   Results: Some of the socioeconomic variables were associated with
   thyroid-related characteristics in cross-sectional analyses. For
   example, there was an overall tendency for groups with higher education
   and higher income to have larger thyroid volumes and an increased risk
   of goiter. However, most of these associations did not attain
   statistical significance after correcting the target p-value for
   multiple testing. Longitudinal analyses did not demonstrate consistent
   results.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status neither substantially influences
   iodine supply nor does it have a major impact on the prevalence and
   incidence of thyroid deficiency-related disorders in the adult
   population of northeast Germany, indicating a good efficacy of the
   German iodine fortification program in all socioeconomic groups.

TI Promoter hypermethylation of the gene encoding heat shock protein B1 in
   oral squamous carcinoma cells
SO ORAL SURGERY ORAL MEDICINE ORAL PATHOLOGY ORAL RADIOLOGY
AB Objective. The mechanism responsible for the regulation of HSPB1
   expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma was explored in this study.
   Study Design. The expression and the methylation status of HSPB1 in oral
   squamous carcinoma cells were examined using real-time reverse
   transcription-PCR, methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing.
   Results. HSPB1 expression was weakly expressed in oral squamous
   carcinoma cell lines (N = 4) as compared to that of normal human oral
   keratinocytes. The lower expressed HSPB1 was associated with promoter
   hypermethylation of the HSPB1 gene, and the expression of HSPB1 could be
   induced by treating the cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,
   RG108. Promoter hypermethylation of the HSPB1 gene was also noted in
   primary oral squamous carcinomas, concomitant with reduced levels of
   HSPB1 gene expression, as compared to those of the paired neighboring
   normal tissues.
   Conclusion. Aberrant promoter hypermethylation of the HSPB1 gene may
   explain the reduced expression of HSPB1 noted in oral cancer cells.

TI Epigenetic inactivation of endothelin-2 and endothelin-3 in colon cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its receptors are overexpressed in human
   cancers, but much less is known about the roles of ET-2 and ET-3 in
   cancer etiology. We sought to examine human and rat colon tumors for
   dysregulation of ET-2 and ET-3 expression and determine the underlying
   mechanisms. Human primary colon cancers and carcinogen-induced rat colon
   tumors were subjected to real-time RT-PCR, immunoblotting and
   immunohistochemistry; EDN2 and EDN3 genes were examined by
   methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing; and
   forced expression of ET-2 and ET-3 was conducted in human colon cancer
   cells followed by real-time cell migration and invasion assays. Rat and
   human colon tumors had markedly reduced expression of ET-2 and ET-3 mRNA
   and protein compared with matched controls. Mechanistic studies revealed
   hypermethylation of EDN2 and EDN3 genes in human primary colon cancers
   and in a panel of human colon cancer cell lines. Forced expression of
   ET-2 and ET-3 attenuated significantly the migration and invasion of
   human colon cancer cells. We conclude that epigenetic inactivation of
   ET-2 and ET-3 occurs frequently in both rat and human colon cancers.
   Current therapeutic strategies target overexpressed members of the ET
   axis via small molecule inhibitors and receptor antagonists, but this
   work supports a complementary approach based on the re-expression of
   ET-2 and ET-3 as natural antagonists of ET-1 in colon cancer.

TI Interactions between Pectic Compounds and Procyanidins are Influenced by

SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB The interactions between procyanidins and pectic compounds are of
   importance in food chemistry. Procyanidins with low (9) and high (30)
   average degrees of polymerization (DP9 and DP30) were extracted from two
   cider apple varieties. Commercial apple and citrus pectins, as well as
   three pectin subfractions (homogalacturonans, partially methylated
   homogalacturonans with degree of methylation 30 and 70) at 30 mM
   galacturonic acid equivalent, were titrated with the two procyanidin
   fractions (at 30 mM (-)-epicatechin equivalent) by isothermal titration
   calorimetry and UVvis spectrophotometry. Slightly stronger affinities
   were recorded between commercial apple or citrus pectins and
   procyanidins of DP30 (K-a = 1460 and 1225 M-1 respectively, expressed
   per monomer units) compared to procyanidins of DP9 (K-a = 1240 and 1085
   M-1, respectively), but stoichiometry and absorbance maxima differed
   between apple and citrus pectins. It was proposed that methylated
   homogalacturonans interacted with procyanidins DP30 mainly through
   hydrophobic interactions. The stronger association was obtained with the
   longer procyanidin molecules interacting with highly methylated pectins.

TI PPAR alpha modulates the TSH beta-subunit mRNA expression in thyrotrope
   T alpha T1 cells and in a mouse model
SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Scope Fasting leads to a significant downregulation of the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, and peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a key transcription factor in
   mediating a magnitude of adaptive responses to fasting. In this study,
   we examined the role of PPAR in regulation of the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. Methods and results
   Thyroid-stimulating hormone -subunit (TSH) mRNA abundance was being
   reduced in response to treatment of TT1 cells with PPAR agonists (p <
   0.05), indicating an inhibitory transcriptional regulation of TSH by
   PPAR. As expected, fasting significantly downregulated TSH mRNA
   expression in a two-factorial study with fed or fasted wild-type (WT)
   and PPAR knockout mice (p < 0.05). In contrast to the in vitro data,
   fasted PPAR knockout mice revealed lower mRNA concentrations of
   pituitary TSH (64%) and TSH-regulated thyroid genes, and lower plasma
   concentrations of thyroxine (T4, 25%), triiodothyronine (T3, 25%), free
   T4 (60%), and free T3 (35%) than fasted WT mice (p < 0.05). Those
   differences were not observed in fed mice. Conclusions Data from
   thyrotrope cells revealed that PPAR could contribute to the
   fasting-associated downregulation of the TSH mRNA expression. In a mouse
   model, fasting led to a significant reduction in TSH mRNA level, but
   unexpectedly this effect was stronger in mice lacking PPAR than in WT
   mice.

TI Developmental Origins of Functional Dyspepsia-Like Gastric
   Hypersensitivity in Rats
SO GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastric hypersensitivity (GHS) contributes to
   epigastric pain in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD); the etiology
   and cellular mechanisms of this dysfunction remain unknown. We
   investigated whether inflammatory insult to the colons of neonatal rats
   induced GHS in adult life. METHODS: We used cellular, molecular, and in
   vivo approaches to investigate the mechanisms of GHS in adult rats
   subjected to neonatal colonic insult by intraluminal administration of
   trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid; controls received saline. Six to 8 weeks
   later, rats were evaluated for GHS and tissue was collected for
   molecular experiments. RESULTS: Inflammatory insult to the colon on
   post-natal day 10 caused an aberrant increase of corticosterone on
   post-natal day 15 and induced GHS in adult life. We called these FD-like
   rats. Inhibition of glucocorticoid receptors after neonatal insult
   blocked the induction of GHS in adult rats. The aberrant increase of
   plasma corticosterone in neonates increased the plasma concentration of
   norepinephrine, nerve growth factor in the gastric fundus muscularis
   externae, brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the thoracic dorsal root
   ganglia and spinal cord, and down-regulated K(v)1.1 messenger RNA in
   thoracic dorsal root ganglia without affecting the expression of
   K(v)1.4, Na(v)1.8, TrpA1, TrpV1, or P2X3 in FD-like rats. Inhibition of
   glucocorticoid receptors during neonatal insult or the inhibition of
   adrenergic receptors, nerve growth factor, or brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor in FD-like rats suppressed GHS. The intrathecal administration of
   small interfering RNAs against K(v)1.1 increased GHS in naive rats.
   CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory insult to the colons of rat pups leads to GHS
   in adult life. GHS is caused by altered expression of genes encoding
   neurotrophins and ion channels, and altered activity of the sympathetic
   nervous system.

TI Cloning and Characterization of the Caspase Family Member BmDronc From
   Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) Embryo Cells
SO ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB Caspases are a family of cysteinyl aspartate proteinases known for their
   essential roles in the regulation of apoptosis. To date, approximate to
   20 caspases have been identified, although few have been cloned and
   characterized in Bombyx mori (L.). Two caspase-9 variants from the B.
   mori embryo cell line (BmE), designated BmDroncL and BmDroncS, were
   cloned. BmDroncL has three classic domains: a caspase recruitment domain
   and large and small subunits, and is a homologue of Drosophila Dronc,
   human caspase-9, Aedes Dronc, and fish caspase-9, whereas BmDroncS lacks
   the large subunit. Instantaneous expression of BmDroncL caused typical
   apoptosis in Sf-9 cells. Moreover, BmDronc gene expression increased
   markedly during the silkworm metamorphosis at the larva pupa and pupa
   moth stages, which suggested that BmDronc plays a crucial role during B.

TI MARCH7 E3 ubiquitin ligase is highly expressed in developing spermatids
   of rats and its possible involvement in head and tail formation
SO HISTOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB Spermatogenesis is a highly complicated metamorphosis process of male
   germ cells. Recent studies have provided evidence that the
   ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in sperm head
   shaping, but the underlying mechanism is less understood. In this study,
   we localized membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH)7, an E3 ubiquitin
   ligase, in rat testis. Northern blot analysis showed that March7 mRNA is
   expressed ubiquitously but highly in the testis and ovary. In situ
   hybridization of rat testis demonstrated that March7 mRNA is expressed
   weakly in spermatogonia and its level is gradually increased as they
   develop. Immunohistochemical analysis detected MARCH7 protein expression
   in spermiogenic cells from late round spermatids to elongated spermatids
   and in epididymal spermatozoa. Moreover, MARCH7 was found to be
   localized to the caudal end of the developing acrosome of late round and
   elongating spermatids, colocalizing with beta-actin, a component of the
   acroplaxome. In addition, MARCH7 was also detected in the developing
   flagella and its expression levels were prominent in elongated
   spermatids. We also showed that MARCH7 catalyzes lysine 48 (K48)-linked
   ubiquitination. Immunolocalization studies revealed that K48-linked
   ubiquitin chains were detected in the heads of elongating spermatids and
   in the acrosome/acroplaxome, neck, midpiece and cytoplasmic lobes of
   elongated spermatids. These results suggest that MARCH7 is involved in
   spermiogenesis by regulating the structural and functional integrity of
   the head and tail of developing spermatids.

TI Geographic variation in basal thermogenesis in little buntings:
   Relationship to cellular thermogenesis and thyroid hormone
   concentrations
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Acclimatization to different ambient conditions is an essential
   prerequisite for survival of small passerine birds. Long-distance
   migration and winter acclimatization induce similar physiological and
   biochemical adjustments in passerines. To understand metabolic
   adaptations, the resting metabolic rate (RMR), the thermogenic
   properties of mitochondria in liver and muscle, and the activity of
   thyroid hormones were examined in field-captured little buntings
   (Emberiza pusilla) between Southeastern (Wenzhou) and Northeastern
   (Qiqihar) China from March to May in 2008 during their migration. Twelve
   birds were trapped from March to April in Wenzhou region, Zhejiang
   Province (27 degrees 29'N, 120 degrees 51'E) and eleven birds originated
   from April to May in Qiqihar region, Heilongjiang Province (47 degrees
   29'N, 124 degrees 02'E). We found that RMRs of little buntings were
   significantly higher in Qiqihar than in Wenzhou. Consistently,
   mitochondrial state-4 respiration capacities and cytochrome c oxidase
   activities (COX) in liver and muscle, and circulating levels of plasma
   triiodothyronine (T(3)) of little buntings were also significantly
   higher in Qiqihar than in Wenzhou. Variation in metabolic biochemical
   markers of liver and muscle, such as state-4 respiration and COX, and
   variation in thyroid hormone levels were correlated with variation in
   RMR. There was also a positive relationship between T(3) and metabolic
   biochemical markers. Little buntings mainly coped with a cold
   environment by enhancing thermogenic capacities through enhanced
   respiratory enzyme activities and plasma T(3). These results support the
   view that the primary means by which small birds meet energetic
   challenges of cold conditions is through metabolic adjustments. (c) 2012

TI Activating RNAs associate with Mediator to enhance chromatin
   architecture and transcription
SO NATURE
AB Recent advances in genomic research have revealed the existence of a
   large number of transcripts devoid of protein-coding potential in
   multiple organisms(1-8). Although the functional role for long
   non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been best defined in epigenetic phenomena
   such as X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting, different classes of
   lncRNAs may have varied biological functions(8-13). We and others have
   identified a class of lncRNAs, termed ncRNA-activating (ncRNA-a), that
   function to activate their neighbouring genes using a cis-mediated
   mechanism(5,14-16). To define the precise mode by which such
   enhancer-like RNAs function, we depleted factors with known roles in
   transcriptional activation and assessed their role in RNA-dependent
   activation. Here we report that depletion of the components of the
   co-activator complex, Mediator, specifically and potently diminished the
   ncRNA-induced activation of transcription in a heterologous reporter
   assay using human HEK293 cells. In vivo, Mediator is recruited to
   ncRNA-a target genes and regulates their expression. We show that
   ncRNA-a interact with Mediator to regulate its chromatin localization
   and kinase activity towards histone H3 serine 10. The Mediator complex
   harbouring disease-causing MED12 mutations(17,18) displays diminished
   ability to associate with activating ncRNAs. Chromosome conformation
   capture confirmed the presence of DNA looping between the ncRNA-a loci
   and its targets. Importantly, depletion of Mediator subunits or ncRNA-a
   reduced the chromatin looping between the two loci. Our results identify
   the human Mediator complex as the transducer of activating ncRNAs and
   highlight the importance of Mediator and activating ncRNA association in
   human disease.

TI A Role for the Nucleoporin Nup170p in Chromatin Structure and Gene
   Silencing
SO CELL
AB Embedded in the nuclear envelope, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) not only
   regulate nuclear transport but also interface with transcriptionally
   active euchromatin, largely silenced heterochromatin, as well as the
   boundaries between these regions. It is unclear what functional role
   NPCs play in establishing or maintaining these distinct chromatin
   domains. We report that the yeast NPC protein Nup170p interacts with
   regions of the genome that contain ribosomal protein and subtelomeric
   genes, where it functions in nucleosome positioning and as a repressor
   of transcription. We show that the role of Nup170p in subtelomeric gene
   silencing is linked to its association with the RSC chromatin-remodeling
   complex and the silencing factor Sir4p, and that the binding of Nup170p
   and Sir4p to subtelomeric chromatin is cooperative and necessary for the
   association of telomeres with the nuclear envelope. Our results
   establish the NPC as an active participant in silencing and the
   formation of peripheral heterochromatin.

   cytokeratins and thyroglobulin. Total body CT scan didnt show any other
   tumor. The patient died two months after surgery. Primary thyroid
   leiomyosarcoma may be mistaken for other tumors, such as anaplastic or
   medullary carcinomas. Therefore, the diagnosis is difficult and requires

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Arginine methylation has emerged as a widespread post-translational
   modification with influence over myriad cellular processes. However, the
   molecular mechanisms underlying such methylarginine-dependent phenomena
   remain unclear. To aid in this research, a facile method was developed
   to install methylarginine analogues on recombinant protein for use in
   biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies. Through chemical
   conjugation of novel alpha,beta-unsaturated amidine precursors with
   proteins, methylarginine mimics can be displayed with control of
   methylation site, extent, and regiospecificity. Analogue installation
   into histones using this strategy produced modified proteins that were
   recognized by antibodies specific to endogenous methylarginine, and
   these histones retained the capacity to form mononucleosomes. Moreover,
   a native methylarginine-specific binding domain was shown to interact
   with methylarginine analogue-modified substrates. This chemical
   conjugation method for installing methylarginine analogues provides an
   efficient route to produce homogeneous modified proteins for subsequent
   investigations of methylarginine-dependent processes.

TI 8-CPT-cAMP/all-trans retinoic acid targets t(11;17) acute promyelocytic
   leukemia through enhanced cell differentiation and PLZF/RAR alpha
   degradation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The refractoriness of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with
   t(11;17)(q23;q21) to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based therapy
   concerns clinicians and intrigues basic researchers. By using a murine
   leukemic model carrying both promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/retinoic
   acid receptor-alpha (PLZF/RAR alpha) and RAR alpha/PLZF fusion genes, we
   discovered that 8-chlorophenylthio adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate
   (8-CPT-cAMP) enhances cellular differentiation and improves gene
   trans-activation by ATRA in leukemic blasts. Mechanistically, in
   combination with ATRA, 8-CPT-cAMP activates PKA, causing phosphorylation
   of PLZF/RAR alpha at Ser765 and resulting in increased dissociation of
   the silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone
   receptors/nuclear receptor corepressor from PLZF/RAR alpha. This process
   results in changes of local chromatin and transcriptional reactivation
   of the retinoic acid pathway in leukemic cells. Meanwhile, 8-CPT-cAMP
   also potentiated ATRA-induced degradation of PLZF/RAR alpha through its
   Ser765 phosphorylation. In vivo treatment of the t(11;17) APL mouse
   model demonstrated that 8-CPT-cAMP could significantly improve the
   therapeutic effect of ATRA by targeting a leukemia-initiating cell
   activity. This combined therapy, which induces enhanced differentiation
   and oncoprotein degradation, may benefit t(11;17) APL patients.

TI Efficient induction of spawning of Northern leopard frogs (Lithobates
   pipiens) during and outside the natural breeding season
SO REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Background: Amphibian declines are now recognized globally. It is also
   well known that many anurans do not reproduce easily in captivity,
   especially when held over long periods, or if they require hibernation
   before breeding. A simple method to induce spawning and subsequent
   development of large numbers of healthy tadpoles is therefore required
   to meet research and conservation goals.
   Methods: The method is based on simultaneous injection of both female
   and male leopard frogs, Lithobates pipiens (formerly called Rana
   pipiens) with a cocktail of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist
   (GnRH-A) and a dopamine antagonist. We call this the AMPHIPLEX method,
   which is derived from the combination of the words amphibian and
   amplexus. Following injection, the animals are thereby induced, and
   perform amplexus and natural fertilization under captive conditions.
   Results: We tested combinations of a GnRH agonist with 2 different
   dopamine antagonists in L. pipiens in the breeding season. The
   combination of des-Gly(10), D-Ala(6), Pro-NHEt(9)-GnRH (0.4 micrograms/g
   body weight; GnRH-A) with metoclopramide hydrochloride (10 micrograms/g
   body weight; MET) or domperidone (DOM) were equally effective, producing
   89% and 88% successful spawning, respectively. This yielded more than
   44,000 eggs for the 16/18 females that ovulated in the GnRH-A+MET group,
   and more than 39,000 eggs for the 15/17 females that ovulated in the
   GnRH-A+DOM group. We further tested the GnRH-A+MET in frogs collected in
   the wild in late autumn and hibernated for a short period under
   laboratory conditions, and report a low spawning success (43%). However,
   GnRH-A priming 24 hours prior to injections of the GnRH-A+MET cocktail
   in animals hibernated for 5-6 weeks produced out-of-season spawning
   (89%) and fertilization (85%) comparable to those we observed for
   in-season spawning. Assessment of age and weight at metamorphosis
   indicated that L. pipiens tadpoles resulting from out-of-season spawning
   grew normally and metamorphosed successfully.
   Conclusion: We provide evidence for successful captive breeding of the
   leopard frog, L. pipiens. This simple protocol can be used to obtain
   large numbers of eggs in a predictable, timed manner.

TI A 5-methylcytosine hotspot responsible for the prevalent HSD17B10
   mutation
SO GENE
AB Approximately half of the cases of hydroxysteroid (17 beta)
   dehydrogenase X (HSD10) deficiency are due to a missense C>T mutation in
   exon 4 of the HSD17B10 gene. The resulting HSD10 (p.R130C) loses most or
   all catalytic functions, and the males with this mutation have a much
   more severe clinical phenotype than those carrying p.V65A, p.L122V, or
   p.E249Q mutations. We found that the mutated cytosine which is +2259
   nucleotide from the ATG of the gene, is >90% methylated in both the
   active and inactive X chromosomes in two normal females as well as in
   the X chromosome of a normal male. Since 5-methylcytosine is prone to
   conversion to thymine by deamination, the methylation of this cytosine
   in normal X chromosomes provides an explanation for the prevalence of
   the p.R130C mutation among patients with HSD10 deficiency. The
   substitution of arginine for cysteine eliminates several hydrogen bonds
   and reduces the van der Waals interaction between HSD10 subunits. The
   resulting disruption of protein structure impairs some if not all of the
   catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of HSD10. A meta-analysis of
   residual HSD10 activity in eight patients with the p.R130C mutation
   showed an average 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD)
   activity of only 6 (+/-5) % of the normal control level. This is
   significantly lower than in cells of patients with other, clinically
   milder mutations and suggests that the loss of HSD10/MHBD activity is a
   marker for the disorder. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Gly-Ala repeat modulates the interaction of Epstein-Barr virus
   nuclear antigen-1 with cellular chromatin
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) plays a pivotal
   role in EBV infection by anchoring the viral episome to cellular DNA,
   which regulates replication and partitioning in dividing cells. Here, we
   have used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and
   fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) techniques to study the
   interaction of EBNA1 with cellular chromatin in interphase and mitosis.
   This. analysis revealed that while EBNA1 is highly mobile in both
   conditions, mobility is significantly reduced in mitosis when an
   immobile fraction is also detected. The N-terminal chromatin-targeting
   module of EBNA1 includes two Gly-Arg rich domains (GR1 and GR2)
   separated by a Gly-Ala repeat (GAr) of variable length. Using a set of
   deletion mutants and GFP-fusion reporters, we found that the GR domains
   cooperatively determine the mobility of EBNA1, whereas mobility is
   increased by the interposed GAr in a length-dependent manner. These
   findings highlight a previously unrecognized property of the interaction
   of EBNA1 with cellular chromatin that may fine-tune its function in the
   maintenance of viral latency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Specific and Efficient N-Propionylation of Histones with Propionic Acid
   N-Hydroxysuccinimide Ester for Histone Marks Characterization by LC-MS
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Histones participate in epigenetic regulation via a variety of dynamic
   posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on them. Mass spectrometry (MS)
   has become a powerful tool to investigate histone PTMs. With the
   bottom-up mass spectrometry approach, chemical derivatization of
   histones with propionic anhydride or deuterated acetic anhydride
   followed by trypsin digestion was widely used to block the hydrophilic
   lysine residues and generate compatible peptides for I,C-MS analysis.
   However, certain severe side reactions (such as acylation on tyrosine or
   serine) caused by acid anhydrides will lead to a number of analytical
   issues such as reducing results accuracy and impairing the
   reproducibility and sensitivity of MS analysis. As an alternative
   approach, we report a novel derivatization method that utilizes
   N-hydroxysuccinimide ester to specifically and efficiently derivatize
   both free and monomethylated amine groups in histones. A competitive
   inhibiting strategy was implemented in our method to effectively prevent
   the side reactions. We demonstrated that our method can achieve
   excellent specificity and efficiency for histones derivatization in a
   reproducible manner. Using this derivatization method, we succeeded to
   quantitatively profile the histone PTMs in KMS11 cell line with
   selective knock out of translocated NSD2 allele (TKO) and the original
   parental KMS11 cell lines (PAR) (NSD2, a histone methyltransferase that
   catalyzes the histone H3 K36 methylation), which revealed a significant
   crosstalk between H3 protein K27 methylation and adjacent K36
   methylation.

TI A precocious adult visual center in the larva defines the unique optic
   lobe of the split-eyed whirligig beetle Dineutus sublineatus
SO FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY
AB Introduction: Whirligig beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae) are aquatic
   insects living on the water surface. They are equipped with four
   compound eyes, an upper pair viewing above the water surface and a lower
   submerged pair viewing beneath the water surface, but little is known
   about how their visual brain centers (optic lobes) are organized to
   serve such unusual eyes. We show here, for the first time, the peculiar
   optic lobe organization of the larval and adult whirligig beetle
   Dineutus sublineatus.
   Results: The divided compound eyes of adult whirligig beetles supply
   optic lobes that are split into two halves, an upper half and lower
   half, comprising an upper and lower lamina, an upper and lower medulla
   and a bilobed partially split lobula. However, the lobula plate, a
   neuropil that in flies is known to be involved in mediating stabilized
   flight, exists only in conjunction with the lower lobe of the lobula. We
   show that, as in another group of predatory beetle larvae, in the
   whirligig beetle the aquatic larva precociously develops a lobula plate
   equipped with wide-field neurons. It is supplied by three larval laminas
   serving the three dorsal larval stemmata, which are adjacent to the
   developing upper compound eye.
   Conclusions: In adult whirligig beetles, dual optic neuropils serve the
   upper aerial eyes and the lower subaquatic eyes. The exception is the
   lobula plate. A lobula plate develops precociously in the larva where it
   is supplied by inputs from three larval stemmata that have a
   frontal-upper field of view, in which contrasting objects such as prey
   items trigger a body lunge and mandibular grasp. This precocious lobula
   plate is lost during pupal metamorphosis, whereas another lobula plate
   develops normally during metamorphosis and in the adult is associated
   with the lower eye. The different roles of the upper and lower lobula
   plates in supporting, respectively, larval predation and adult
   optokinetic balance are discussed. Precocious development of the upper
   lobula plate represents convergent evolution of an ambush hunting
   lifestyle, as exemplified by the terrestrial larvae of tiger beetles
   (Cicindelinae), in which activation of neurons in their precocious
   lobula plates, each serving two large larval stemmata, releases reflex
   body extension and mandibular grasp.

TI A fluorescence-based assay for the measurement of S-adenosylhomocysteine
   hydrolase activity in biological samples
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins plays crucial roles in
   numerous biological processes, including epigenetic control, virus
   replication, and cell differentiation. In mammals, the rate-limiting
   step of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation process is
   exclusively controlled by S-adenosylhomocysteine (S-AdoHcy) hydrolase
   (SAHH). SAHH hydrolyzes S-AdoHcy to adenosine and homocysteine (Hcy) and
   is therefore a potential therapeutic target for various diseases,
   including cancer, malaria, and viral diseases. However, a simple and
   highly sensitive assay for the evaluation of SAHH activity, particularly
   for drug discovery, had not yet been developed. Here we present the
   development of a fluorescence-based assay for the measurement of SAHH
   activity in biological samples. We combined the advantages of the
   detection of fluorescent thiol groups in Hcy by ThioGlo1 with the
   S-AdoHcy-driven enzyme-coupled reaction. Our results confirmed the
   reliability of the proposed assay for the measurement of the SAHH
   activity of purified SAHH and showed the potential of this assay for the
   measurement of the SAHH activity of biological samples. Therefore, the
   proposed SAHH activity assay may be utilized in clinical laboratories
   and in high-throughput screenings for the identification of new SAHH
   inhibitors with potentially beneficial effects on numerous pathologies.

TI The effect of stocking density on growth, metabolism and ammonia-N
   excretion during larval ontogeny of the spiny lobster Sagmariasus
   verreauxi
SO AQUACULTURE
AB Stocking density is a critical factor affecting performance of aquatic
   organisms in culture, however, its influence on energy utilisation has
   rarely been considered. Energy partitioning is particularly important
   for spiny lobster phyllosoma, which must accumulate sufficient energy
   reserves for metamorphosis and the non-feeding puerulus stage. The
   current study is the first to examine the energetics of spiny lobsters
   throughout the entire phyllosoma phase and determined the physiological
   influence of density. Growth and development, oxygen consumption and
   ammonia-N excretion rates were measured in Sagmariasus verreauxi
   phyllosoma that were cultured at High Density (HD) and Low Density (LD)
   from hatch to puerulus. Phyllosoma growth and development was more
   advanced in LD phyllosoma after 108 day in culture and mass of LD instar
   17 phyllosoma was greater. There were no differences in routine
   metabolic rate (R(r)) and ammonia-N excretion of phyllosoma between
   densities. However, the O:N ratio decreased in final instar phyllosoma
   demonstrating a shift towards higher protein catabolism. Routine
   metabolic rate also increased in late stage phyllosoma, possibly due to
   higher energy requirements in preparation for metamorphosis and
   increased swimming activity. The R(r) of spiny lobster larvae was
   significantly lower than that of other crustacean larvae, which may be a
   characteristic of their extended larval phase, slower growth rate, and
   larger body size. The study demonstrated late stage phyllosoma have
   higher weight specific energy requirements than the preceding larval
   stages and exhibit a metabolic shift towards protein catabolism,
   suggesting an increased importance of storing lipid as an energy reserve
   for the puerulus stage. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

TI Relationship between urinary triclosan and paraben concentrations and
   serum thyroid measures in NHANES 2007-2008
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Triclosan and parabens are broad spectrum antimicrobials used in a range
   of consumer products. In vitro and animal studies have suggested the
   potential for these compounds to disrupt thyroid function, though
   studies in humans have been limited. The objective of the study was to
   assess the relationship of urinary concentrations of triclosan and
   parabens with serum thyroid measures in a large, representative sample
   of the US population. We conducted an exploratory, cross-sectional
   analysis of data on urinary biomarkers of triclosan and paraben exposure
   and serum thyroid measures obtained from 1831 subjects (ages >= 12
   years) as part of the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES). We found evidence of some inverse
   associations between parabens and circulating thyroid hormone levels in
   adults, with the strongest and most consistent associations among
   females. We also observed a positive association between triclosan and
   total triiodothyonine (T3) concentrations in adolescents. These results,
   in accordance with the in vitro and animal literature, suggest that
   paraben, and potentially triclosan, exposures may be associated with
   altered thyroid hormone levels in humans. Further research is needed for
   confirmation and to determine the potential clinical and public health
   significance of these findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   1 When both lines of defense fail, expression of the repeats yields

TI Optimal histone H3 to linker histone H1 chromatin ratio is vital for
   mesodermal competence in Xenopus
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Cellular differentiation during embryogenesis involves complex gene
   regulation to enable the activation and repression of genes. Here, we
   show that mesodermal competence is inhibited in Xenopus embryos depleted
   of histones H3 and H3.3, which fail to respond to Nodal/Activin
   signaling and exhibit concomitant loss of mesodermal gene expression. We
   find that transcriptional activation in gastrula embryos does not
   correlate with promoter deposition of H3.3. Instead, gastrulation
   defects in H3.3/H3-deficient embryos are partially rescued with
   concurrent depletion of the linker histone H1A. In addition, we show
   that linker histone H1-induced premature loss of mesodermal competence
   in animal cap explants can be abrogated with the overexpression of
   nucleosomal H3.3/H3. Our findings establish a chromatin-mediated
   regulatory mechanism in which a threshold level of H3 is required to
   prevent H1-induced gene repression, and thus facilitate mesodermal
   differentiation in response to inductive signaling.

TI InCroMAP: integrated analysis of cross-platform microarray and pathway
   data
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Microarrays are commonly used to detect changes in gene expression
   between different biological samples. For this purpose, many analysis
   tools have been developed that offer visualization, statistical analysis
   and more sophisticated analysis methods. Most of these tools are
   designed specifically for messenger RNA microarrays. However, today,
   more and more different microarray platforms are available. Changes in
   DNA methylation, microRNA expression or even protein phosphorylation
   states can be detected with specialized arrays. For these microarray
   technologies, the number of available tools is small compared with mRNA
   analysis tools. Especially, a joint analysis of different microarray
   platforms that have been used on the same set of biological samples is
   hardly supported by most microarray analysis tools. Here, we present
   InCroMAP, a tool for the analysis and visualization of high-level
   microarray data from individual or multiple different platforms.
   Currently, InCroMAP supports mRNA, microRNA, DNA methylation and protein
   modification datasets. Several methods are offered that allow for an
   integrated analysis of data from those platforms. The available features
   of InCroMAP range from visualization of DNA methylation data over
   annotation of microRNA targets and integrated gene set enrichment

TI Chrysin activates Notch1 signaling and suppresses tumor growth of
   anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in vitro and in vivo
SO CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a very aggressive thyroid
   gland malignancy with very poor prognosis. It is suspected that the
   Notch signaling pathway, which is not active in ATC, may have a tumor
   suppressor function in this neoplasm. However, it remains unknown
   whether activation of Notch can yield therapeutic efficacies in ATC.
   METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   chrysin, a potential Notch inducer identified via high-throughput
   screening, on ATC both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Chrysin treatment
   of ATC cells led to a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular growth.
   Protein and messenger RNA levels of Notch1 and Hes1 (hairy/enhancer of
   split 1), a downstream Notch1 effector, were both up-regulated with
   treatment. Luciferase reporter assays incorporating the C
   promoter-binding factor 1 (CBF1) binding site also confirmed the
   functional activity of chrysin-induced Notch1. Oral administration of
   chrysin suppressed the growth of ATC xenografts by an average of 59%
   compared with the vehicle control group (P = .002). In addition,
   calculated median time to tumor progression was 11 days for control mice
   and 21 days for the chrysin treatment group (P = .008). Analysis of
   chrysin-treated ATC tumors revealed an increase in the active
   intracellular domain of Notch1 protein. Activation of Notch1 in vivo was
   associated with the induction of cleaved Poly ADP ribose polymerase
   (PARP) protein, indicating that the growth inhibition was due to
   apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The novel Notch1 activator chrysin inhibits
   tumor growth in ATC both in vitro and in vivo. Chrysin could be a
   promising therapeutic candidate for ATC, and this justifies further
   clinical studies. Cancer 2013. (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.

TI SMARCA3, a Chromatin-Remodeling Factor, Is Required for p11-Dependent
   Antidepressant Action
SO CELL
AB p11, through unknown mechanisms, is required for behavioral and cellular
   responses to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We show
   that SMARCA3, a chromatin-remodeling factor, is a target for the
   p11/annexin A2 heterotetrameric complex. Determination of the crystal
   structure indicates that SMARCA3 peptide binds to a hydrophobic pocket
   in the heterotetramer. Formation of this complex increases the
   DNA-binding affinity of SMARCA3 and its localization to the nuclear
   matrix fraction. In the dentate gyrus, both p11 and SMARCA3 are highly
   enriched in hilar mossy cells and basket cells. The SSRI fluoxetine
   induces expression of p11 in both cell types and increases the amount of
   the ternary complex of p11/annexin A2/SMARCA3. SSRI-induced neurogenesis
   and behavioral responses are abolished by constitutive knockout of
   SMARCA3. Our studies indicate a central role for a chromatin-remodeling
   factor in the SSRI/p11 signaling pathway and suggest an approach to the
   development of improved antidepressant therapies.

TI Regulation of Transcription through Acetylation of H3K122 on the Lateral
   Surface of the Histone Octamer
SO CELL
AB Histone modifications are key regulators of chromatin function. However,
   little is known to what extent histone modifications can directly impact
   on chromatin. Here, we address how a modification within the globular
   domain of histones regulates chromatin function. We demonstrate that
   H3K122ac can be sufficient to stimulate transcription and that mutation
   of H3K122 impairs transcriptional activation, which we attribute to a
   direct effect of H3K122ac on histone-DNA binding. In line with this, we
   find that H3K122ac defines genome-wide genetic elements and chromatin
   features associated with active transcription. Furthermore, H3K122ac is
   catalyzed by the coactivators p300/CBP and can be induced by nuclear
   hormone receptor signaling. Collectively, this suggests that
   transcriptional regulators elicit their effects not only via signaling
   to histone tails but also via direct structural perturbation of
   nucleosomes by directing acetylation to their lateral surface.

TI Corticosteroid-Induced Neural Remodeling Predicts Behavioral
   Vulnerability and Resilience
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Neurons in distinct brain regions remodel in response to postnatal
   stressor exposure, and structural plasticity may underlie stress-related
   modifications in behavioral outcomes. Given the persistence of
   stress-related diseases such as depression, a critical next step in
   identifying the contributions of neural structure to psychopathology
   will be to identify brain circuits and cell types that fail to recover
   from stressor exposure. We enumerated dendritic spines during and after
   chronic stress hormone exposure in hippocampal CA1, deep-layer
   prefrontal cortex, and the basal amygdala and also reconstructed
   dendritic arbors of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Corticosterone modified
   dendritic spine density in these regions, but with the exception of the
   orbitofrontal cortex, densities normalized with a recovery period.
   Dendritic retraction of hippocampal CA1 neurons and anhedonic-like
   insensitivity to a sucrose solution also persisted despite a recovery
   period. Using mice with reduced gene dosage of p190rhogap, a
   cytoskeletal regulatory protein localized to dendritic spines, we next
   isolated structural correlates of both behavioral vulnerability (spine
   elimination) and resilience (spine proliferation) to corticosterone
   within the orbital cortex. Our findings provide novel empirical support
   for the perspective that stress-related structural reorganization of
   certain neuron populations can persist despite a "recovery" period from
   stressor exposure and that these modifications may lay a structural
   foundation for stressor vulnerability-or resiliency-across the lifespan.

TI Thyroid hormone increases fibroblast growth factor receptor expression
   and disrupts cell mechanics in the developing organ of corti
SO BMC DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Background: Thyroid hormones regulate growth and development. However,
   the molecular mechanisms by which thyroid hormone regulates cell
   structural development are not fully understood. The mammalian cochlea
   is an intriguing system to examine these mechanisms, as cellular
   structure plays a key role in tissue development, and thyroid hormone is
   required for the maturation of the cochlea in the first postnatal week.
   Results: In hypothyroid conditions, we found disruptions in sensory
   outer hair cell morphology and fewer microtubules in non-sensory
   supporting pillar cells. To test the functional consequences of these
   cytoskeletal defects on cell mechanics, we combined atomic force
   microscopy with live cell imaging. Hypothyroidism stiffened outer hair
   cells and supporting pillar cells, but pillar cells ultimately showed
   reduced cell stiffness, in part from a lack of microtubules. Analyses of
   changes in transcription and protein phosphorylation suggest that
   hypothyroidism prolonged expression of fibroblast growth factor
   receptors, and decreased phosphorylated Cofilin.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that thyroid hormones may be
   involved in coordinating the processes that regulate cytoskeletal
   dynamics and suggest that manipulating thyroid hormone sensitivity might
   provide insight into the relationship between cytoskeletal formation and
   developing cell mechanical properties.

TI Serrated pathway: Alternative route to colorectal cancer
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Serrated polyps have been an area of intense focus for
   gastroenterologists over the past several years. Contrary to what was
   thought before, a growing body of literature indicates that these polyps
   can be precursors of colorectal cancer (CRC). Most of these lesions,
   particularly those in the proximal colon, have so far been
   under-recognized and missed during colonoscopy, qualifying these lesions
   to be the main cause of interval cancers. It is estimated that 10%-20%
   of CRCs evolve through this alternative, serrated pathway, with a
   distinct genetic and epigenetic profile. Aberrant DNA methylation plays
   a central role in the development of this CRC subtype. This
   characteristic molecular background is reflected in a unique
   pathological and clinical manifestation different from cancers arising
   via the traditional pathway. In this review we would like to highlight
   morphological, molecular and clinical features of this emerging pathway
   that are essential for gastroenterologists and may influence their
   everyday practice. (C) 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI NF-kappa B Forms a Complex with the Chromatin Remodeler BRG1 to Regulate
   Schwann Cell Differentiation
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB In the developing peripheral nervous system, axon-derived signals
   stimulate Schwann cells to undergo a global genetic reprogramming
   involving the cessation of cellular division and the upregulation of
   myelin genes. Howsuch a comprehensive change in gene transcription is
   regulated is poorly understood. Here we report that BRG1/SMARCA4, the
   central helicase of the mammalian SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling
   complex, is required for Schwann cells to differentiate and form myelin,
   both in vitro and in vivo, in the mouse. BRG1 was highly activated in
   Schwann cells at early stages of myelination, and loss of the enzyme
   inhibited their differentiation and completely prevented myelin
   formation. Furthermore, we identify NF-kappa B as a key transcription
   factor that associates with the BRG1 complex in response to neuregulin 1
   type III. During myelination, BRG1 was activated through the formation
   of a complex with NF-kappa B, and both proteins bound to the promoter
   region of Sox10, an inducer of myelination. These findings delineate a
   novel mechanism whereby axonal signals promote myelination through the
   remodeling of chromatin structure.

   Parameters in Rats
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY

   diet on animal physiology and health. Here, we report the effect of
   contrasting crop protection (with or without chemosynthetic pesticides)
   and fertilization (manure or mineral fertilizers) regimes on feed
   composition and growth and the physiological parameters of rats. The use
   of manure instead of mineral fertilizers in feed production resulted in
   lower concentrations of protein (18.8 vs 20.6%) and cadmium (3.33 vs
   4.92 mu g/100g) but higher concentrations of polyphenols (1.46 vs 0.89
   g/100g) in feeds and higher body protein (22.0 vs 21.5%), body ash (3.59
   vs 3.51%), white blood cell count (10.86 vs 8.19 x 10(3)/mm(3)), plasma
   glucose (7.23 vs 6.22 mmol/L), leptin (3.56 vs 2.78 ng/mL), insulin-like

   cpm) but lower plasma testosterone (1.07 vs 1.97 ng/mL) and mitogen
   stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes (182 vs 278 x 10(3) cpm) in

   significant interactions between fertilization and crop protection
   occurred.

TI Characterization of Streptonigrin Biosynthesis Reveals a Cryptic
   Carboxyl Methylation and an Unusual Oxidative Cleavage of a N-C Bond
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Streptonigrin (STN, 1) is a highly functionalized aminoquinone alkaloid
   with broad and potent antitumor activity. Here, we reported the
   biosynthetic gene cluster of STN identified by genome scanning of a STN
   producer Streptomyces flocculus CGMCC4.1223. This cluster consists of 48
   genes determined by a series of gene inactivations. On the basis of the
   structures of intermediates and shunt products accumulated from five
   specific gene inactivation mutants and feeding experiments, the
   biosynthetic pathway was proposed, and the sequence of tailoring steps
   was preliminarily determined. In this pathway, a cryptic methylation of
   lavendamycin was genetically and biochemically characterized to be
   catalyzed by a leucine carboxyl methyltransferase StnF2. A [2Fe-2S](2+)
   cluster-containing aromatic ring dioxygenase StnB1/B2 system was
   biochemically characterized to catalyze a regiospecific cleavage of the
   N-C8' bond of the indole ring of the methyl ester of lavendamycin. This
   work provides opportunities to illuminate the enzymology of novel
   reactions involved in this pathway and to create, using genetic and
   chemo-enzymatic methods, new streptonigrinoid analogues as potential
   therapeutic agents.

TI Prognostic significance of aberrantly silenced ANPEP expression in
   prostate cancer
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Background: Novel biomarkers for prostate cancer (PC) are urgently
   needed. This study investigates the expression, epigenetic regulation,
   and prognostic potential of ANPEP in PC.
   Methods: Aminopeptidase N (APN; encoded by ANPEP) expression was
   analysed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays representing
   267 radical prostatectomy (RP) and 111 conservatively treated (CT) PC
   patients. Clinical end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and
   cancer-specific survival (CSS), respectively. The ANPEP promoter
   methylation levels were determined by bisulphite sequencing or
   MethyLight analysis in 278 nonmalignant and PC tissue samples, and in
   cell lines.
   Results: The APN expression was significantly downregulated in PC
   compared with nonmalignant prostate tissue samples. Aberrant promoter
   hypermethylation was frequently observed in PC tissue samples, and
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced ANPEP expression in three hypermethylated
   prostate cell lines, suggesting epigenetic silencing. Negative APN
   immunoreactivity was significantly associated with short RFS and short
   CSS in the RP and CT cohort, respectively, independently of routine
   clinicopathological predictors. Combining APN with a known angiogenesis
   marker (vascular endothelial growth factor or microvessel density)
   improved risk prediction significantly in both cohorts.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest negative APN immunoreactivity as a new
   independent adverse prognostic factor for patients with clinically
   localised PC and, furthermore, that epigenetic mechanisms are involved
   in silencing of ANPEP in PC.

TI Dynamics and biological relevance of DNA demethylation in Arabidopsis
   antibacterial defense
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that silences transposable
   elements (TEs) and repeats. Whereas the establishment and maintenance of
   DNA methylation are relatively well understood, little is known about
   their dynamics and biological relevance in plant and animal innate
   immunity. Here, we show that some TEs are demethylated and
   transcriptionally reactivated during antibacterial defense in
   Arabidopsis. This effect is correlated with the down-regulation of key
   transcriptional gene silencing factors and is partly dependent on an
   active demethylation process. DNA demethylation restricts multiplication
   and vascular propagation of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae
   in leaves and, accordingly, some immune-response genes, containing
   repeats in their promoter regions, are negatively regulated by DNA
   methylation. This study provides evidence that DNA demethylation is part
   of a plant-induced immune response, potentially acting to prime
   transcriptional activation of some defense genes linked to TEs/repeats.

TI Thyroid Frozen Section Supplementary or Unnecessary?
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
AB A total of 704 cases of thyroid cancer were retrospectively reviewed
   (2005 to 2011) to assess the contribution of frozen section (FS) to
   preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA). There were 613 papillary
   carcinomas (87.1%), of which 237 were < 1.0 cm. FNA was diagnostic or
   suspicious in 39.9% of micropapillary thyroid carcinomas and 75.8% of
   papillary carcinomas. FS was diagnostic in 52.3% and 76.6%,
   respectively. In no instance did the FS diagnosis change the procedure
   (total or near-total thyroidectomy). Neither FNA nor FS was
   diagnostically definitive in follicular neoplasms. A diagnosis of
   follicular carcinoma was made only after thorough histologic analysis.
   FS should have a less prominent role in the management of thyroid
   masses, especially in the context of total thyroidectomy for benign
   disease. FS may be more productively applied to the identification of
   metastatic lymph nodes or parathyroids in the surgical field.

TI Determination of ACC-induced cell-programmed death in roots of Vicia
   faba ssp minor seedlings by acridine orange and ethidium bromide
   staining
SO PROTOPLASMA
AB Fluorescence staining with acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide
   (EB) showed that nuclei of cortex root cells of
   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-treated Vicia faba ssp.
   minor seedlings differed in color. Measurement of resultant fluorescence
   intensity (RFI) showed that it increased when the color of nuclear
   chromatin was changed from green to red, indicating that EB moved to the
   nuclei via the cell membrane which lost its integrity and stained nuclei
   red. AO/EB staining showed that changes in color of the nuclear
   chromatin were accompanied by DNA condensation, nuclei fragmentation,
   and chromatin degradation which were also shown after
   4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol staining. These results indicate that ACC
   induced programmed cell death. The increasing values of RFI together
   with the corresponding morphological changes of nuclear chromatin were
   the basis to prepare the standard curve; cells with green unchanged
   nuclear chromatin were alive while those with dark orange and bright red
   nuclei were dead. The cells with nuclei with green-yellow,
   yellow-orange, and bright orange chromatin with or without their
   condensation and fragmentation chromatin were dying. The prepared curve
   has became the basis to draw up the digital method for detection and
   determination of the number of living, dying, and dead cells in an in
   planta system and revealed that ACC induced death in about 20% of root
   cortex cells. This process was accompanied by increase in ion leakage,
   shortening of cells and whole roots, as well as by increase in weight
   and width of the apical part of roots and appearance of few
   aerenchymatic spaces while not by internucleosomal DNA degradation.

TI Thyroid hormone regulation of Sirtuin 1 expression and implications to
   integrated responses in fasted mice
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, has been connected to
   beneficial effects elicited by calorie restriction. Physiological
   adaptation to starvation requires higher activity of SIRT1 and also the
   suppression of thyroid hormone (TH) action to achieve energy
   conservation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that those two events are
   correlated and that TH may be a regulator of SIRT1 expression.
   Forty-eight-hour fasting mice exhibited reduced serum TH and increased
   SIRT1 protein content in liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT), and
   physiological thyroxine replacement prevented or attenuated the
   increment of SIRT1 in liver and BAT of fasted mice. Hypothyroid mice
   exhibited increased liver SIRT1 protein, while hyperthyroid ones showed
   decreased SIRT1 in liver and BAT. In the liver, decreased protein is
   accompanied by reduced SIRT1 activity and no alteration in its mRNA.
   Hyperthyroid and hypothyroid mice exhibited increases and decreases in
   food intake and body weight gain respectively. Food-restricted
   hyperthyroid animals (pair-fed to euthyroid group) exhibited liver and
   BAT SIRT1 protein levels intermediary between euthyroid and hyperthyroid
   mice fed ad libitum. Mice with TH resistance at the liver presented
   increased hepatic SIRT1 protein and activity, with no alteration in
   Sirt1 mRNA. These results suggest that TH decreases SIRT1 protein,
   directly and indirectly, via food ingestion control and, in the liver,
   this reduction involves TR beta. The SIRT1 reduction induced by TH has
   important implication to integrated metabolic responses to fasting, as
   the increase in SIRT1 protein requires the fasting-associated
   suppression of TH serum levels.

   amygdala. In the absence of P2rx7s decreased behavioural despair in the
   FST, reduced immobility in the TST and attenuated amphetamine-induced
   hyperactivity were detected. Basal norepinephrine levels were elevated
   in the amygdala, whereas stress-induced ACTH and corticosterone
   responses were alleviated in P2rx7(-/-) mice. Sub-acute treatment with
   the selective P2rx7 antagonist, Brilliant Blue G, reproduced the effect
   of genetic deletion in the TST and AH test in P2rx7+/+ but not
   P2rx7(-/-) mice. No change in behavioural phenotype was observed in
   chimeras lacking the P2rx7 in their haematopoietic compartment. Whole
   genome microarray analysis indicated a widespread up-and down-regulation
   of genes crucial for synaptic function and neuroplasticity by genetic
   deletion. Here, we present evidence that the absence of P2rx7s on
   non-haematopoietic cells leads to a mood-stabilizing phenotype in
   several behavioural models and suggest a therapeutic potential of P2rx7
   antagonists for the treatment of mood disorders.

TI Overexpression of pro-inflammatory genes and down-regulation of SOCS-1
   in human PTC and in hypoxic BCPAP cells
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is frequently
   overexpressed and activated in many cancer types. However, its
   regulation and function in thyroid carcinomas are only partially known.
   Aim of our study was to demonstrate that adaptation to the hypoxic
   micro-environment by human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cells, in
   the absence of leukocyte infiltrate, induces a "molecular inflammation''
   process characterized by the expression of a large set of genes normally
   involved in inflammation. To address this, tumor, peritumor or normal
   host tissue from eleven human PTC surgical samples, were separated by
   laser capture microdissection (LCMD) and studied by real-time
   quantitative PCR and Western blot. In such condition, we observed an
   increased expression and activation of HIF-1 alpha, NF-kB and
   proinflammatory genes only in tumor tissues. Importantly, an
   anti-inflammatory gene such as SOCS-1 was markedly down-regulated in
   tumor tissue compared to surrounding normal host tissue. Similar results
   were found in fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)-derived specimens
   from PTC and in hypoxic human papillary thyroid tumor cell line, BCPAP.
   Moreover, we also detected an elevated expression of metalloproteinase-9
   (MMP9) both in solid tumor and in hypoxic-treated BCPAP cells. Our
   findings reveal that, in human PTC tumor, hypoxic conditions are
   accompanied by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, down-regulation
   of anti-inflammatory genes and increased expression of MMP9. We propose
   that a better understanding of the pro-and anti-inflammatory pathways
   involved in the "molecular inflammation'' process even in the absence of
   leukocyte, may help to clarify progression toward malignancy and may
   prove useful for new anti-tumor strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Waiting for thyroid surgery: A study of psychological morbidity and
   determinants of health associated with long wait times for thyroid
   surgery
SO LARYNGOSCOPE
AB Objectives: Patients with thyroid pathology tend have longer surgical
   wait times. Uncertainty during this wait can have negative
   psychologically impact. This study aims to determine the degree of
   psychological morbidity in patients waiting for thyroid surgery. Study
   Design: Prospectively assessing patients pre- and postoperative
   psychological morbidity (level 2c). Methods: Patients waiting for
   thyroidectomy were mailed a sociodemographic and four psychological
   morbidity questionnaires: Impact of Events ScaleRevised (IES-R), Illness
   Intrusiveness Ratings Scale (IIRS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and
   Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We assessed whether
   anxiety was related to length of wait and a number of
   clinical/sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: We achieved a 53% response
   rate over a 3-year period, with 176 patients providing complete
   preoperative data; and 74 (42%) completed postoperative data. The
   average age was 53 (+/- 12) years; 82% were female. Respondents with a
   suspicious or known malignancy waited an average of 107 days while those
   with benign neoplastic biopsies waited an average of 218 days for
   thyroidectomy. Respondents reported substantial psychological morbidity
   with high IES-R, IIRS, PSS, and HADS scores. There was no significant
   association between psychological morbidity and wait times, clinical or
   sociodemographic factors. Postoperative anxiety decreased significantly
   in all psychological morbidity measures except for the IIRS.
   Conclusions: Patients waiting for thyroid surgery have mild to moderate
   psychological morbidity and long wait times for surgery. These appear
   not to be related. Psychological morbidity decreases after surgery.
   Reducing wait time can potentially reduce the time that patients have to
   live with unnecessary stress and anxiety. Laryngoscope, 2012

TI Phenotypic and tumor molecular characterization of colorectal cancer in
   relation to a susceptibility SMAD7 variant associated with survival
SO CARCINOGENESIS
AB The minor allele (G) of rs4939827, a SMAD7 (18q21) intronic variant, is
   associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) and
   poorer survival after diagnosis. Our objective was to evaluate the
   associations of this variant with different tumor phenotype and
   intratumoral molecular characteristics. We evaluated 1509 CRC cases and
   2307 age-matched controls nested within the Nurses' Health Study and the
   Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We used the TaqMan assay to
   genotype rs4939827 and logistic regression to assess the association of
   rs4939827 with risk of CRC according to different phenotypic and
   molecular characteristics. We found that the minor allele (G) in
   rs4939827 (SMAD7, 18q21) was associated with a lower risk of developing
   tumor stage pT1 or pT2 CRC [multivariate odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.87] but not tumor stage pT3 or pT4
   (multivariate OR, 1.07; 95% CI 0.93-1.23, P for heterogeneity = 1.2 x
   10(-4)). The association between rs4939827 and CRC also significantly
   differed by methylation of RUNX3 (P for heterogeneity = 0.005). Among
   those with CRC, the minor allele (G) in rs4939827 was significantly
   associated with poorer overall survival (hazards ratio, 1.20; 95% CI,
   1.02-1.42). We can conclude that the minor allele (G) of the germline
   intronic SMAD7 variant rs4939827 is associated with a lower risk of CRC
   with earlier tumor stage and CRC without methylation of the tumor
   suppressor RUNX3. These findings suggest that individuals with this
   SMAD7 variant that develop CRC are more probably to have tumors with
   greater invasiveness and methylation of RUNX3, which potentially
   contributes to their poorer observed survival.

TI Temperature and Heart Rate Responses to Exercise following Mild
   Traumatic Brain Injury
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB We have previously reported that mild fluid percussion injury (FPI) is
   associated with a heightening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
   response during the first post-injury weeks. This is the same time
   period when rehabilitative exercise has been strongly suggested to be
   ineffective. Here, we explored whether cardiac and temperature autonomic
   function may also be compromised during this early post-injury period.
   Following an FPI or sham injury, rats were exercised with forced (fRW)
   or voluntary (vRW) running wheels on post-injury days 0-4 and 7-11.
   Results indicated that overall activity levels were decreased and
   circadian rhythm was affected after FPI. Autonomic disruptions became
   evident when exercise was introduced, and these disruptions were
   dependent upon the characteristics of exercise. Elevations in heart rate
   (HR) and core body temperature (CBT) were observed as a response to vRW
   and fRW. FPI animals had more pronounced increases in HR as a result of
   vRW. Likewise, increases in HR were observed with fRW in all animals. A
   strong stress response has recently been associated with fRW exercise.
   FPI rats exposed to fRW were more responsive to experimental
   manipulations and had higher a CBT after the FRW session. The results
   suggest that subacute exercise, particularly if linked to a strong
   stress response, may be counterproductive. Here we show that cardiac and
   temperature autonomic function are compromised during the subacute
   period following a mild TBI.

TI DNA-Methylome Analysis of Mouse Intestinal Adenoma Identifies a
   Tumour-Specific Signature That Is Partly Conserved in Human Colon Cancer
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Aberrant CpG methylation is a universal epigenetic trait of cancer cell
   genomes. However, human cancer samples or cell lines preclude the
   investigation of epigenetic changes occurring early during tumour
   development. Here, we have used MeDIP-seq to analyse the DNA methylome
   of APC(Min) adenoma as a model for intestinal cancer initiation, and we
   present a list of more than 13,000 recurring differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs) characterizing intestinal adenoma of the mouse. We show
   that Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) targets are strongly enriched
   among hypermethylated DMRs, and several PRC2 components and DNA
   methyltransferases were up-regulated in adenoma. We further demonstrate
   by bisulfite pyrosequencing of purified cell populations that the DMR
   signature arises de novo in adenoma cells rather than by expansion of a
   pre-existing pattern in intestinal stem cells or undifferentiated crypt
   cells. We found that epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressors, which
   occurs frequently in colon cancer, was rare in adenoma. Quite
   strikingly, we identified a core set of DMRs, which is conserved between
   mouse adenoma and human colon cancer, thus possibly revealing a global
   panel of epigenetically modified genes for intestinal tumours. Our data
   allow a distinction between early conserved epigenetic alterations
   occurring in intestinal adenoma and late stochastic events promoting
   colon cancer progression, and may facilitate the selection of more
   specific clinical epigenetic biomarkers.

TI Ecdysone-dependent and ecdysone-independent programmed cell death in the
   developing optic lobe of Drosophila
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The adult optic lobe of Drosophila develops from the primordium during
   metamorphosis from mid-3rd larval stage to adult. Many cells die during
   development of the optic lobe with a peak of the number of dying cells
   at 24 h after puparium formation (h APF). Dying cells were observed in
   spatio-temporal specific clusters. Here, we analyzed the function of a
   component of the insect steroid hormone receptor, EcR, in this cell
   death. We examined expression patterns of two EcR isoforms, EcR-A and
   EcR-B1, in the optic lobe. Expression of each isoform altered during
   development in isoform-specific manner. EcR-B1 was not expressed in
   optic lobe neurons from 0 to 6 h APF, but was expressed between 9 and 48
   h APF and then disappeared by 60 h APF. In each cortex, its expression
   was stronger in older glia-ensheathed neurons than in younger ones.
   EcR-B1 was also expressed in some types of glia. EcR-A was expressed in
   optic lobe neurons and many types of glia from 0 to 60 h APF in a
   different pattern from EcR-B1. Then, we genetically analyzed EcR
   function in the optic lobe cell death. At 0 h APF, the optic lobe cell
   death was independent of any EcR isoforms. In contrast, EcR-B1 was
   required for most optic lobe cell death after 24 h APF. It was suggested
   that cell death cell-autonomously required EcR-B1 expressed after
   puparium formation. beta FTZ-F1 was also involved in cell death in many
   dying-cell clusters, but not in some of them at 24 h APF. Altogether,
   the optic lobe cell death occurred in ecdysone-independent manner at
   prepupal stage and ecdysone-dependent manner after 24 h APF. The
   acquisition of ecdysone-dependence was not directly correlated with the
   initiation or increase of EcR-B1 expression. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Adrenal-Specific Scavenger Receptor BI Deficiency Induces Glucocorticoid
   Insufficiency and Lowers Plasma Very-Low-Density and Low-Density
   Lipoprotein Levels in Mice
SO ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY
AB Objective-We determined the physiological consequences of
   adrenocortical-specific deletion of scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI)
   function in C57BL/6 wild-type mice.
   Methods and Results-One adrenal from 10-day-old SR-BI knockout (KO) mice
   or wild-type controls was transplanted under the renal capsule of
   adrenalectomized C57BL/6 recipient mice. The fasting plasma
   corticosterone level increased over time in transplanted mice.
   Corticosterone values in SR-BI KO transplanted mice remained approximate
   to 50% lower (P<0.001) as compared with wild-type transplanted mice,
   which coincided with adrenocortical lipid depletion. A 6.5-fold higher
   (P<0.01) plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone level was present in SR-BI
   KO transplanted mice reminiscent of primary glucocorticoid
   insufficiency. On feeding with cholic acid-containing high
   cholesterol/high fat diet, SR-BI KO transplanted mice exhibited a 26%
   (P<0.05) reduction in their liver triglyceride level. Hepatic myosin
   regulatory light chain interacting protein/inducible degrader of the
   low-density lipoprotein receptor mRNA expression was 48% (P<0.01)
   decreased in adrenal-specific SR-BI KO mice, which was paralleled by a
   marked decrease (-46%; P<0.01) in proatherogenic very-low-density and
   low-density lipoprotein levels.
   Conclusion-Adrenal-specific disruption of SR-BI function induces
   glucocorticoid insufficiency and lowers plasma very-low-density and
   low-density lipoprotein levels in atherogenic diet-fed C57BL/6 mice.
   These findings further highlight the interaction between adrenal
   high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol uptake by SR-BI, adrenal
   steroidogenesis, and the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism.

TI LCAT deficiency in mice is associated with a diminished adrenal
   glucocorticoid function
SO JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH
AB containing lipoproteins can provide cholesterol for synthesis of
   glucocorticoids. Here we assessed adrenal glucocorticoid function in
   LCAT knockout (KO) mice to determine the specific contribution of
   HDL-cholesteryl esters to adrenal glucocorticoid output in vivo. LCAT KO
   mice exhibit an 8-fold higher plasma free cholesterol-to-cholesteryl
   ester ratio (P < 0.001) and complete HDL-cholesteryl ester deficiency.
   ApoB-containing lipoprotein and associated triglyceride levels are
   increased in LCAT KO mice as compared with C57BL/6 control mice (44%; P
   < 0.05). Glucocorticoid-producing adrenocortical cells within the zona
   fasciculata in LCAT KO mice are devoid of neutral lipids. However,
   adrenal weights and basal corticosterone levels are not significantly
   changed in LCAT KO mice. In contrast, adrenals of LCAT KO mice show
   compensatory up-regulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis
   (HMG-CoA reductase; 516%; P < 0.001) and acquisition (LDL receptor;
   385%; P < 0.001) and a marked 40-50% lower glucocorticoid response to
   adrenocorticotropic hormone exposure, endotoxemia, or fasting (P < 0.001
   for all).(jlr) In conclusion, our studies show that HDL-cholesteryl
   ester deficiency in LCAT KO mice is associated with a 40-50% lower
   adrenal glucocorticoid output. These findings further highlight the

TI Development of a disease-specific health-related quality of life
   questionnaire (THYCA-QoL) for thyroid cancer survivors
SO ACTA ONCOLOGICA
AB Background. To date, no valid instrument is available that focuses on
   specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues that affect
   thyroid cancer survivors. The objective of this study was to develop and
   pretest a thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire that can be used
   in addition to the more general European Organization for Research and
   Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).
   Material and methods. Potentially relevant issues were identified by a
   systematic literature review, a focus group meeting, and an issue list
   completed by six health care professionals (HCP) and 18 thyroid cancer
   survivors. Resultant issues were analyzed on importance and relevance
   (phase I). The issues were formulated into a long provisional list of
   questions (phase II). These questions were administered in combination
   with the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 306 Dutch thyroid cancer survivors to pretest
   the hypothesized scale structure (phase III). Although the development
   of this questionnaire was not set up as an international study, phases
   I-III are in agreement with the methodology of the EORTC guidelines.
   Results. The literature search, focus group and issue list completed by
   HCP and survivors resulted in 75 issues. These were reduced to create a
   30 item provisional list. Pretesting led to a selection of 24 items with
   a good range of response. This resulted in the THYCA-QoL containing 24
   items and seven conceptual scales. Conclusion. The THYCA-QoL in
   combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30 is ready for a large (international)
   scale validation study, and will assess HRQoL issues of most relevance
   and concern for thyroid cancer survivors.

AB Clinical neurologists and scientists who study multiple sderosis face
   open questions regarding the integration of epidemiological data with
   genome-wide association studies and clinical management. of patients. It
   is becoming evident that the interplay of environmental influences and
   individual genetic susceptibility modulates disease presentation and
   therapeutic responsiveness. The molecular mechanisms through which
   environmental signals are translated into changes in gene expression
   include DNA methylation, post-translational modification of nudeosomal
   histones, and non-coding RNAs. These mechanisms are regulated by
   families of specialised enzymes that are tissue selective and cell-type
   specific. A model of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis should integrate
   underlying risk related to genetic susceptibility with cell-type
   specific epigenetic changes occurring in the immune system and in the
   brain in response to ageing and environmental stimuli.

TI miR-106a overexpression and pRB downregulation in sporadic colorectal
   cancer
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
AB Rb1 plays an important role in cell cycle progression and therefore may
   be involved in malignant transformation of colonic cells. The aim of our
   research was to define the potential role of Rb1 as a prognostic
   biomarker in tumorigenesis of sporadic colorectal cancer, and to examine
   the role of miR-106a in Rb1 regulation as it functionally binds to 3'UTR
   of transcribed mRNA. We examined LOH and promoter methylation status.
   Real-time PCR was used for Rb1 mRNA and miR-106a, and
   immunohistochemistry for protein expression analysis. All the results
   obtained from patients' samples were correlated with the
   clinicopathological parameters in order to determine its influence on
   the sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis. LOH showed no correlation with
   mRNA and pRb expression. 51.5% of tumor samples were scored negative for
   pRb staining. Despite this finding, we detected overexpression of Rb1
   mRNA in tumor samples in comparison to the adjacent normal tissue (p =
   0.023). mRNA overexpression was consistent with Rb1 promoter methylation
   analysis results, which showed no methylation in the investigated
   samples. Expression analysis of miR-106a in the patients samples showed
   its overexpression in colorectal cancer (p<10(-4)). Negative pRb score
   was expected according to the definition of tumor suppressor genes and
   their proposed role in the malignant transformation of the cells. The
   observed discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression can be
   explained by a regulatory mechanism that inhibits translation, such as
   microRNA silencing. Our results suggest that miR-106a might have a
   regulatory role for Rb1 in sporadic colorectal cancer. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Macrostress: do large-scale ecological patterns exist in the
   glucocorticoid stress response of vertebrates?
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Disturbances, or stressors, are pervasive in nature and profoundly
   influence fitness of individuals and, ultimately, species extinction
   risk. Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones affect multiple physiological and
   behavioural traits regulating the responses of vertebrates to stressors.
   Current understanding of what influences GC stress response variation
   among species is poor. However, identifying environmental causes of
   species-level variation in the GC stress response is important to
   understanding macroevolutionary patterns in this key physiological
   system and potentially offers a metric for evaluating species risk to
   global change. We tested whether GC stress response of 22 reptile and 66
   bird species exposed to a uniform capture stress protocol could be
   predicted from a GC stressor space model. This model predicts that
   species-level variation in GCs results from multivariate selection from
   environmental gradients and species-specific metabolic sensitivities.
   Thus, these multivariate selection interactions delimit the cumulative
   selection intensity causing GC stress response variation among
   vertebrates. Using phylogenetic generalized least square regression
   analysis, we ranked models incorporating putative variables pertaining
   to the corticosterone stress response (CSR) for reptiles and birds
   separately. The top-ranked models explained between 14% and 33% of
   species variation in the CSR. Models indicated that combinations of
   variables including increasing body mass, net primary productivity and
   latitude influenced GC stress responsiveness in reptiles and birds. We
   conclude that GC stress response variation among species represents, in
   part, evolution to species-specific traits and large-scale environmental
   variation. Further improvement to predicting species variation in GC
   stress response could be achieved by expanding our stressor space model
   to integrate microevolutionary and ecological processes. There is a
   pressing need to identify physiological traits that predict species
   responses to environmental change. Conceptually, the use of plasma GC
   levels as a species-specific marker for environmental tolerance could be
   plausible. However, we identify three major knowledge gaps and ensuing
   research areas to aid understanding of the utility of variation in GC
   stress response as a metric for inferring how species might respond to
   global change.

TI SAMe treatment prevents the ethanol-induced epigenetic alterations of
   genes in the Toll-like receptor pathway
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
AB Prior studies showed that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway
   genes were upregulated in the liver of rats fed ethanol, but not in rats
   fed ethanol plus S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). These results were
   obtained using a PCR microplate array analysis for TLRs and associated
   proteins such as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine mRNA levels. A
   large number of genes were upregulated by the ethanol diet, but not the
   ethanol plus SAMe diet. In the present study, using the same
   experimental rat livers, DNA methylation analysis was done by using an
   Epitect Methyl DNA Restriction Kit (Qiagen, 335451) (24 genes). The
   results of all the genes combined show a highly significant increase in
   methylation in the ethanol-fed group of rats, but not in the
   dextrose-fed, SAMe-fed or ethanol plus SAMe-fed groups of rats. There
   was also an increase in DNA methylation in rats with high blood alcohol
   levels compared to a rat with a low blood alcohol level. The individual
   genes that were upregulated as indicated by the increased mRNA measured
   by qPCR correlated positively with the increased methylation of the DNA
   of the corresponding genes as follows: Cd14, Hspa1a, Irf1, Irak1, Irak2,

TI Pluripotent stem cells escape from senescence-associated DNA methylation
   changes
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Pluripotent stem cells evade replicative senescence, whereas other
   primary cells lose their proliferation and differentiation potential
   after a limited number of cell divisions, and this is accompanied by
   specific senescence-associated DNA methylation (SA-DNAm) changes. Here,
   we investigate SA-DNAm changes in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) upon
   long-term culture, irradiation-induced senescence, immortalization, and
   reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using
   high-density HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. SA-DNAm changes are highly
   reproducible and they are enriched in intergenic and nonpromoter regions
   of developmental genes. Furthermore, SA-hypomethylation in particular
   appears to be associated with H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and Polycomb-group 2
   target genes. We demonstrate that ionizing irradiation, although
   associated with a senescence phenotype, does not affect SA-DNAm.
   Furthermore, overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the human
   telomerase (TERT) or conditional immortalization with a
   doxycycline-inducible system (TERT and SV40-TAg) result in telomere
   extension, but do not prevent SA-DNAm. In contrast, we demonstrate that
   reprogramming into iPSC prevents almost the entire set of SA-DNAm
   changes. Our results indicate that long-term culture is associated with
   an epigenetically controlled process that stalls cells in a particular
   functional state, whereas irradiation-induced senescence and
   immortalization are not causally related to this process. Absence of
   SA-DNAm in pluripotent cells may play a central role for their escape
   from cellular senescence.

TI The changes in chromosome 6 spatial organization during chromatin
   polytenization in the Calliphora erythrocephala Mg. (Diptera:
   Calliphoridae) nurse cells
SO PROTOPLASMA
AB Localization of Calliphora erythrocephala chromosome 6 in a 3D nuclear
   space at different stages of nurse cell chromatin polytenization was
   analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and 3D microscopy. The
   obtained results suggest a large-scale chromatin relocation in the C.
   erythrocephala nurse cell nuclei, which is accompanied by a change in
   the chromosome territory of chromosome 6 associated with the change in
   expression activity of the nucleus and formation of reticular chromatin
   structure. It was revealed that the relocation of chromosome 6
   (nucleolus organizer chromosome) is accompanied by fragmentation of the
   single large nucleolus into micronucleoli, which are spread over the
   entire nuclear space being associated with their nucleolar organizer
   regions. Presumably, the chromosome 6 material during transition to a
   highly polytenized structure is redistributed in the nucleus so that the
   inactive pericentromeric regions are displaced to the nuclear periphery,
   while the chromosome regions carrying rDNA sequences loop out beyond the
   chromosome territory. Being dispersed over the entire nuclear space,
   rDNA sequences are likely to be amplified, thereby providing numerous
   small signals from the chromosome 6-specific DNA probe. Micronucleoli
   are formed around the actively transcribed nucleolar organizer regions.

TI Thyroid Hormones Decrease Plasma 1 alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Levels
   Through Transcriptional Repression of the Renal 25-Hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1
   alpha-Hydroxylase Gene (CYP27B1)
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The primary determinant of circulating 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
   (1,25[OH](2)D) levels is the activity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1
   alpha-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 27B1 [CYP27B1]) in the kidney.
   Hyperthyroid patients have been reported to have low levels of plasma
   1,25(OH)(2)D. However, the detailed mechanism of thyroid hormone
   actionon vitamin D metabolism is still poorly understood. The present
   study determined whether renal CYP27B1 gene expression was negatively
   regulated by thyroid hormones. T(3)-induced hyperthyroid mice showed
   marked decreases in plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D levels and in renal expression
   of CYP27B1 mRNA but no changes in plasma concentrations of calcium, PTH,
   or fibroblast growth factor-23. In addition, we observed that T(3)
   administration significantly decreased plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D and renal
   CYP27B1 mRNA levels that were increased by low-calcium or low-phosphorus
   diets and induced hypocalcemia in mice fed a low-calcium diet. Promoter
   analysis revealed that T(3) decreases the basal transcriptional activity
   of the CYP27B1 gene through thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha and TR
   beta 1) and the retinoid X receptor alpha(RXR alpha) in renal proximal
   tubular cells. Interestingly, we identified an everted repeat negative
   thyroid hormone response element (1 alpha-nTRE) overlapping the sterol
   regulatory element (1 alpha-SRE) and the TATA-box -50 to -20 base pairs
   from thehumanCYP27B1 gene transcription start site. Finally, we
   established that CYP27B1 gene transcription is positively regulated by
   SRE-binding proteins and that a T(3)-bound TR beta 1/RXR alpha
   heterodimer inhibits SRE-binding protein-1c-induced transcriptional
   activity through the 1 alpha-nTRE. These results suggest that
   transcriptional repression of the CYP27B1 gene by T(3)-bound TRs/RXR
   alpha, acting through the 1 alpha-nTRE, results in decreased renal
   CYP27B1 expression and plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D levels. (Endocrinology 154:

TI Oxidative stress in coronary artery disease: epigenetic perspective
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The association between oxidative stress and coronary artery disease
   (CAD) is well documented. However, the role of epigenetic factors
   contributing to oxidative stress is relatively unexplored. In this
   study, we aimed to explore the impact of DNA methylation profile in
   BCL2/E1B adenovirus interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), extracellular
   superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1)
   on the oxidative stress in CAD. Further, the contribution of folate
   pathway genetic polymorphisms in regulating epigenome was elucidated.
   The expression of BNIP3, EC-SOD, and GSTP1 were studied by using
   Maxima@SYBR-green based real-time qPCR approach in peripheral blood
   samples. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and
   methylation-specific PCR were used to study promoter CpG island
   methylation. Further, the effect of homocysteine on BNIP3 gene
   expression was studied in human aortic endothelial cells in vitro. CAD
   cases exhibited upregulation of BNIP3, downregulation of EC-SOD and
   GSTP1. Hypomethylation of BNIP3 and hypermethylation of EC-SOD were
   observed in CAD cases. The expression of BNIP3 was positively correlated
   with homocysteine, MDA, protein carbonyls, and methylene
   tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, while showing inverse association with
   cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase C1420T. The expressions of
   EC-SOD and GSTP1 showed positive association with thymidylate synthase
   (TYMS) 2R3R, while inverse association with MDA, protein carbonyls, and
   methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G. In vitro analysis showed
   homocysteine-dependent upregulation of BNIP3. The results of this study
   suggest that the aberrations in one-carbon metabolism appear to induce
   altered gene expression of EC-SOD, GSTP1, and BNIP3, and thus contribute
   to the increased oxidative stress and increased susceptibility to CAD.

TI Effects of varying dietary iodine supplementation levels as iodide or
   iodate on thyroid status as well as mRNA expression and enzyme activity
   of antioxidative enzymes in tissues of grower/finisher pigs
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of high
   dietary iodine supply and different iodine sources on thyroid status and
   oxidative stress in target tissues of the thyroid hormones in fattening
   pigs.
   Eighty castrates (body weight: 33.3 +/- A 0.4 kg) were randomly allotted
   into five different treatments: The control diet contained 150 mu g I/kg
   as KI, the other feeding groups were supplemented with 4,000 mu g I/kg
   (as KI and KIO(3)) and 10,000 mu g I/kg (as KI and KIO(3)),
   respectively. The mRNA expression levels of sodium/iodide symporter
   (NIS) and key antioxidant enzymes (Cu/Zn SOD, CAT, GPx) were analyzed in
   thyroid gland, liver, kidney, muscle, and adipose tissue sampled during
   slaughter. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme activities and the effect on
   lipid peroxidation (MDA) were determined in liver and muscle.
   In thyroid gland, a significant downregulation of NIS and Cu/Zn SOD mRNA
   expression was observed in high-iodine groups. In liver, a source effect
   on the mRNA expression of Cu/Zn SOD between KI and KIO(3) at 4,000 mu g
   I/kg was shown. In contrast, not SOD but GPx activity was affected by
   iodine source with strongest downregulation in high KIO(3) group. In
   muscle, GPx activity was affected by both iodine source and dose,
   showing stronger downregulation in KI groups. In kidney and adipose
   tissue, oxidative stress parameters showed no or only unsystematic
   changes. However, variation in iodine supply had no effect on MDA
   concentrations.
   NIS expression was significantly decreased with increased iodine
   supplementation, which is to ensure the thyroid gland function. However,
   the alleviating effect of iodine supplementation observed in antioxidant
   enzyme mRNA expression and activity did not reflect on the lipid
   peroxide level.

TI PcG-Mediated Higher-Order Chromatin Structures Modulate Replication
   Programs at the Drosophila BX-C
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Polycomb group proteins (PcG) exert conserved epigenetic functions that
   convey maintenance of repressed transcriptional states, via
   post-translational histone modifications and high order structure
   formation. During S-phase, in order to preserve cell identity, in
   addition to DNA information, PcG-chromatin-mediated epigenetic
   signatures need to be duplicated requiring a tight coordination between
   PcG proteins and replication programs. However, the interconnection
   between replication timing control and PcG functions remains unknown.
   Using Drosophila embryonic cell lines, we find that, while presence of
   specific PcG complexes and underlying transcription state are not the
   sole determinants of cellular replication timing, PcG-mediated
   higher-order structures appear to dictate the timing of replication and
   maintenance of the silenced state. Using published datasets we show that
   PRC1, PRC2, and PhoRC complexes differently correlate with replication
   timing of their targets. In the fully repressed BX-C, loss of function
   experiments revealed a synergistic role for PcG proteins in the
   maintenance of replication programs through the mediation of
   higher-order structures. Accordingly, replication timing analysis
   performed on two Drosophila cell lines differing for BX-C gene
   expression states, PcG distribution, and chromatin domain conformation
   revealed a cell-type-specific replication program that mirrors
   lineage-specific BX-C higher-order structures. Our work suggests that
   PcG complexes, by regulating higher-order chromatin structure at their
   target sites, contribute to the definition and the maintenance of
   genomic structural domains where genes showing the same epigenetic state
   replicate at the same time.

TI Maternal adversity and ecological stressors in natural populations: the
   role of stress axis programming in individuals, with implications for
   populations and communities
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Biomedical researchers have long appreciated that maternal stressors can
   induce preparative and adaptive programming in offspring via exposure to
   maternal Glucocorticoids (GCs). However, few ecologists are aware of the
   capacity for maternal GC exposure to translate ecological and
   environmental stressors into preparative and adaptive programmed
   offspring responses in free-living systems. We review a growing body of
   experimental work indicating that circulating maternal GCs link
   ecological stressors with adaptive programming of the stress axis.
   Throughout, we emphasise that natural and human-induced ecological
   stressors play a fundamental role in programming the capacity of
   individuals, populations and communities to respond to both predictable
   and unpredictable ecological change via translating maternal adversity
   into responsive programming of the vertebrate stress axis. To encourage
   rigorous testing of this paradigm in a broad range of ecological
   systems, we introduce the principal extrinsic stressors with a
   recognised potential to alter maternal circulating GC levels. We then
   review from the biomedical literature regarding the underlying
   physiological and epigenetic mechanisms of stress-induced programming of
   individual phenotypes to predict how variation in ecological stressors
   can produce individual variation in stress axis management. To
   appreciate the potential evolutionary inertia (i.e. adaptive value) of
   maternally programmed individual variation, we review key recent studies
   in free-living systems that test its adaptive function, and then discuss
   how variation in stress-axis programming may scale up to influence
   populations and ecological communities. Given the huge potential of this
   field, it is encouraging that ecologists are beginning to examine how
   and why maternal GCs translate ecological and environmental stressors
   into preparative stress axis programming in free-living systems.

TI Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induced Thyroid Disorders: A Review and
   Hypothesis
SO THYROID
AB Background: Thyroid dysfunction is a well-known adverse effect of
   sunitinib, a drug that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases,
   including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). As
   several kinds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now available,
   this has been postulated to be a side effect of the TKIs that target the
   VEGFR (VEGF-TKIs). However, sunitinib, one of the first-generation TKIs,
   likely causes thyroid dysfunction more frequently than other TKI
   classes, leading not only to hypothyroidism, but also to thyrotoxicosis.
   Summary: Based on the reports published to date, including our own
   studies, we have hypothesized that sunitinib may exert these effects,
   because it targets a broad spectrum of tyrosine kinases. This not only
   includes VEGFR2, but also VEGFR1 and the platelet-derived growth factor
   receptor (PDGFR). This, in turn, may suggest that not only VEGFR2 but
   also the PDGFR and/or the VEGFR1 play an important role during
   angiogenesis in the thyroid.
   Conclusions: Our current hypothesis may explain the mechanisms that
   underlie TKI-induced thyroid disorders. By learning how various kinds of
   TKIs affect thyroid function, we may elucidate how the angiogenesis in
   thyroid is regulated both physiologically and pathologically.

TI The WD40-Repeat Proteins NFC101 and NFC102 Regulate Different Aspects of
   Maize Development through Chromatin Modification
SO PLANT CELL
AB The maize (Zea mays) nucleosome remodeling factor complex component101
   (nfc101) and nfc102 are putative paralogs encoding WD-repeat proteins
   with homology to plant and mammalian components of various chromatin
   modifying complexes. In this study, we generated transgenic lines with
   simultaneous nfc101 and nfc102 downregulation and analyzed phenotypic
   alterations, along with effects on RNA levels, the binding of
   NFC101/NFC102, and Rpd3-type histone deacetylases (HDACs), and histone
   modifications at selected targets. Direct NFC101/NFC102 binding and
   negative correlation with mRNA levels were observed for indeterminate1
   (id1) and the florigen Zea mays CENTRORADIALIS8 (ZCN8), key activators
   of the floral transition. In addition, the abolition of NFC101/NFC102
   association with repetitive sequences of different transposable elements
   (TEs) resulted in tissue-specific upregulation of nonpolyadenylated RNAs
   produced by these regions. All direct nfc101/nfc102 targets showed
   histone modification patterns linked to active chromatin in
   nfc101/nfc102 downregulation lines. However, different mechanisms may be
   involved because NFC101-NFC102 proteins mediate HDAC recruitment at id1
   and TE repeats but not at ZCN8. These results, along with the
   pleiotropic effects observed in nfc101/nfc102 downregulation lines,
   suggest that NFC101 and NFC102 are components of distinct chromatin
   modifying complexes, which operate in different pathways and influence
   diverse aspects of maize development.

AB Objective: 3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (T(3))-predominant Graves' disease is
   characterized by the increasing volume of thyroid goiter resulting in
   poor prognosis. Although type 1 and type 2 iodothyronine deiodinases
   (DIO1 and DIO2 respectively) are known to be overexpressed in the
   thyroid tissues of T(3)-predominant Graves' disease, the pathogenesis of
   this disease is still unclear. The aim of our study is to identify genes
   that characterize T(3)-predominant Graves' disease tissue in order to
   clarify the molecular mechanism of this disease.
   Design and methods: mRNAs from two thyroid tissues of both typical
   T(3)-predominant and common-type Graves' disease were analyzed with DNA
   microarrays with probes for 28 869 genes. Genes identified to be
   differentially expressed between the two groups were further analyzed in
   the second and third screenings using 70 Graves' thyroid tissues by
   real-time quantitative RT-PCR.
   Results: Twenty-three candidate genes were selected as being
   differentially expressed in the first screening with microarrays. Among
   these, seven genes, leucine-rich repeat neuronal 1 (LRRN1), bone
   morphogenetic protein 8a (BMP8A), N-cadherin (CDH2), phosphodiesterase
   1A (PDE1A), creatine kinase mitochondrial 2 (CKMT2), integrin beta-3
   (ITGB3), and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 4 (PTPN4),
   were confirmed to be differentially expressed in DIO1 or DIO2 over-and
   underexpressing Graves' tissues.
   Conclusions: These genes are related to the characteristics of
   T(3)-predominant Graves' disease, such as high titer level of serum
   anti-TSH receptor antibody, high free T(3) to free thyroxine ratio, and
   a large goiter size. They might play a role in the pathogenesis of
   T(3)-predominant Graves' disease. European Journal of Endocrinology 168

TI The DNA Methylome As A Biomarker for Epigenetic Instability and Human
   Aging
SO REJUVENATION RESEARCH
AB Methylation of DNA is intimately involved in control of
   mammalian/vertebrate gene expression as part of a complex epigenetic
   regulatory system. We hypothesize that DNA methylation at
   cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs), the "DNA methylome," evolved to
   increase stability of the differentiated state in somatic vertebrate
   cells, especially post-mitotic cells, which may have helped to increase
   longevity. Therefore, the DNA methylome may play a key role in human
   aging and be an ideal source of biomarkers aging. A new model that links
   the methylome to chronological age has been reported by Hannum et al.(1)
   that accurately predicts age and rate of aging from the DNA methylation
   state of 71 markers in human blood samples. This model may make possible
   the development of new anti-aging therapeutics as well as more
   accurately assess the impact of anti-aging regimens, such as caloric
   restriction and drugs such as rapamycin. Furthermore, the model reveals
   information loss with increased age consistent with noise/unstable
   diffentiation-based models of aging. The model may eventually lead to
   experiments to differentiate the contributions of biomolecular damage
   and noise/incomplete structural replication during aging.

TI Aldosterone-Specific Activation of Cardiomyocyte Mineralocorticoid
   Receptor In Vivo
SO HYPERTENSION
AB Inappropriate mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation is involved in
   cardiac diseases. Whether and how aldosterone is involved in the
   deleterious effects of cardiac mineralocorticoid activation is still
   unclear. Mice overexpressing MR in cardiomyocytes and their controls
   were treated for 7 days with aldosterone, and cardiac transcriptome was
   analyzed. Aldosterone regulated 265 genes in cardiomyocyte-targeted MR
   overexpression mice. Forty three of these genes were also differentially
   expressed between untreated cardiomyocyte-targeted MR overexpression and
   controls mice, thus representing putative aldosterone-regulated genes in
   cardiomyocytes. Among these genes, we focused on connective tissue
   growth factor (CTGF). In vivo, in cardiomyocyte-targeted MR
   overexpression mice, aldosterone (but not corticosterone) induced CTGF
   expression (mRNA and protein) in cardiomyocytes. Ex vivo, aldosterone
   induced the binding of mineralocorticoid receptor to CTGF promoter and
   increased the expression of its transcript. Aldosterone induction of
   CTGF synthesis in cardiomyocytes seems pathologically relevant as the
   increase in CTGF observed in a model of heart failure (transverse aortic
   constriction) in rats was prevented by eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid
   receptor blocker. This study demonstrates that aldosterone specifically
   regulates gene expression in cardiomyocytes despite large prevalence of
   glucocorticoids in plasma. (Hypertension. 2013;61:361-367.) circle

TI Age dependent differences in the regulation of hippocampal steroid
   hormones and receptor genes: Relations to motivation and cognition in
   male rats
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Estrogen and estrogenic functions are age-dependently involved in the
   modulation of learning, memory and mood in female humans and animals.
   However, the investigation of estrogenic effects in males has been
   largely neglected. Therefore, we investigated the hippocampal gene
   expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER alpha, beta) in
   8-week-old, 12-week-old and 24-week-old male rats. To control for
   possible interactions between the expression of the estrogen receptor
   genes and other learning-related steroid receptors, androgen receptors
   (AR), corticosterone-binding glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and
   mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) were also measured. Furthermore, the
   concentrations of the ligands 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone and
   corticosterone were measured. The spatial training was conducted in a
   hole-board. The 8-week-old rats exhibited higher levels of general
   activity and exploration during the training and performed best with
   respect to spatial learning and memory, whereas no difference was found
   between the 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The trained 8-week-old
   rats exhibited increased gene expression of ER alpha compared with the
   untrained rats in this age group as well as the trained 12-week-old and
   24-week-old rats. The concentrations of estradiol and testosterone,
   however, were generally higher in the 24-week-old rats than in the
   8-week-old and 12-week-old rats. The ERa mRNA concentrations correlated
   positively with behavior that indicate general learning motivation.
   These results suggest a specific role of ERa in the age-related
   differences in motivation and subsequent success in the task. Thus,
   estrogen and estrogenic functions may play a more prominent role in
   young male behavior and development than has been previously assumed.

TI Organizing the genome with H2A histone variants
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Chromatin acts as an organizer and indexer of genomic DNA and is a
   highly dynamic and regulated structure with properties directly related
   to its constituent parts. Histone variants are abundant components of
   chromatin that replace canonical histones in a subset of nucleosomes,
   thereby altering nucleosomal characteristics. The present review focuses
   on the H2A variant histones, summarizing current knowledge of how H2A
   variants can introduce chemical and functional heterogeneity into
   chromatin, the positions that nucleosomes containing H2A variants occupy
   in eukaryotic genomes, and the regulation of these localization

TI Skewed X-inactivation patterns in ageing healthy and myelodysplastic
   haematopoiesis determined by a pyrosequencing based transcriptional
   clonality assay
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS
AB Background Investigation of X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIP) by
   determination of differential CpG-methylation has been widely applied
   for investigation of female cell clonality. Using this approach the
   clonal origin of various tumours has been corroborated. Controversially,
   strong age-related increase of peripheral blood (PB) cell clonality in
   haematologically healthy female subjects was reported. Recently,
   transcriptional XCIP ratio analysis challenged these results and
   questioned the suitability of methylation based clonality assays.
   Methods To reinvestigate XCIP-skewing in CD34, low-density mononuclear
   bone marrow (BM) as well as PB cells from healthy female subjects and
   patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we established a
   transcriptional assay using pyrosequencing technique for quantification
   of single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequencies, representative for
   XCIP ratios.
   Results Our assay provides high sensitivity for XCIP ratio assessment as
   determined by standard curves, reproducibility, inter-marker correlation
   as well as correlation with the DNA-methylation based human androgen
   receptor (HUMARA) assay. Notably, in agreement with most studies
   investigating this issue, significant age-related increase of XCIP
   skewing in PB cells from healthy elderly female subjects was confirmed.
   Moreover, XCIP ratio analysis suggests even stronger clonal
   manifestation in BM and CD34 cells. In MDS, XCIP skewing levels were
   distinctively elevated as compared with controls of similar age and
   higher degrees were associated with poor clinical outcome.
   Conclusions Transcriptional clonal profiling via pyrosequencing allows
   accurate assessment of XCIP ratios, confirms the validity of the
   DNA-methylation based HUMARA assay and reveals important insights into
   ageing healthy and myelodysplastic haematopoiesis.

TI Health, condition, and survival of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus)
   across a gradient of stream habitat quality following an experimental
   cortisol challenge
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Urbanization and agricultural practices can lead to alterations in
   stream habitat quality. However, there have been few attempts to
   understand if these alterations influence the health and condition of
   fish, or their ability to respond to multiple stressors. This study
   examines a sentinel fish in streams adjacent to different types of
   land-use practices and how they respond to an experimental stressor.
   Creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) from replicate agricultural, urban,
   and reference streams were subjected to an experimental manipulation of
   cortisol, the primary stress hormone in fish. A single intraperitoneal
   injection raised circulating plasma cortisol for similar to 3 days,
   mimicking the physiological effects of a prolonged stressor. We compared
   the survival, health, and condition of cortisol-treated, sham-treated,
   and control fish across the different land-use types. While marginally
   non-significant (P = 0.06), cortisol-treated fish displayed an similar
   to 50% increase in mortality in streams adjacent to agricultural areas.
   We did not observe differences in blood glucose, condition factor,
   splenic index, and gonadosomatic index, or parasite burden among the
   treatment groups or relative to land-use type. However, within the
   agricultural watersheds, the hepatosomatic index value of fish receiving
   a sham treatment was similar to 20% greater than fish in the control
   treatment, a significant result that appears to be spurious given that a
   similar effects was not observed in other land-use types. Overall, these
   results suggest that in the wild, there are apparently compensatory
   mechanisms that enable creek chub to persist despite being exposed to a
   significant challenge with little evidence that the outcome is modulated
   by variation in habitat quality, at least among the three types of sites
   (i.e., urban, agricultural, and reference) studied here. Nonetheless, we
   encourage additional field-based studies with larger sample sizes or
   better recapture rates to improve statistical power and provide more
   clarity on how variation in habitat quality influences how fish respond
   to other challenges.

TI Methylome Profiling Reveals Distinct Alterations in Phenotypic and
   Mutational Subgroups of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Even though mutations in epigenetic regulators frequently occur in
   myeloproliferative neoplasms, their effects on the epigenome have not
   been well studied. Furthermore, even though primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
   has a markedly worse prognosis than essential thrombocytosis or
   polycythemia vera, the molecular distinctions between these subgroups
   are not well elucidated. We conducted the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment
   enriched by LM-PCR) assay to study genome-wide methylation in
   polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and PMF samples compared
   with healthy controls. We determined that polycythemia vera and
   essential thrombocytosis are characterized by aberrant promoter
   hypermethylation, whereas PMF is an epigenetically distinct subgroup
   characterized by both aberrant hyper- and hypomethylation. Aberrant
   hypomethylation in PMF was seen to occur in non-CpG island loci, showing
   further qualitative differences between the disease subgroups. The
   differentially methylated genes in polycythemia vera and essential
   thrombocytosis were involved predominantly in cell signaling pathways
   and were enriched for binding sites of GATA1 and other transcription
   factors. In contrast, aberrantly methylated genes in PMF were involved
   in inflammatory pathways and were enriched for NF1, LEF1, and other
   transcription factors. Within the PMF subgroup, cases with ASXL1
   disruptions formed an epigenetically distinct subgroup with relatively
   increased methylation. Cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with
   TET2 mutations showed decreased levels of hydroxymethylation and
   distinct set of hypermethylated genes. In contrast, the JAK2V617F
   mutation did not drive epigenetic clustering within MPNs. Finally, the
   significance of aberrant methylation was shown by sensitivity of
   MPN-derived cell lines to decitabine. These results show epigenetic
   differences between PMF and polycythemia vera/essential thrombocytosis
   and reveal methylomic signatures of ASXL1 and TET2 mutations. Cancer

TI Drosophila Yemanuclein and HIRA Cooperate for De Novo Assembly of
   H3.3-Containing Nucleosomes in the Male Pronucleus
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB The differentiation of post-meiotic spermatids in animals is
   characterized by a unique reorganization of their nuclear architecture
   and chromatin composition. In many species, the formation of sperm
   nuclei involves the massive replacement of nucleosomes with protamines,
   followed by a phase of extreme nuclear compaction. At fertilization, the
   reconstitution of a nucleosome-based paternal chromatin after the
   removal of protamines requires the deposition of maternally provided
   histones before the first round of DNA replication. This process
   exclusively uses the histone H3 variant H3.3 and constitutes a unique
   case of genome-wide replication-independent (RI) de novo chromatin
   assembly. We had previously shown that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA
   plays a central role for paternal chromatin assembly in Drosophila.
   Although several conserved HIRA-interacting proteins have been
   identified from yeast to human, their conservation in Drosophila, as
   well as their actual implication in this highly peculiar RI nucleosome
   assembly process, is an open question. Here, we show that Yemanuclein
   (YEM), the Drosophila member of the Hpc2/Ubinuclein family, is essential
   for histone deposition in the male pronucleus. yem loss of function
   alleles affect male pronucleus formation in a way remarkably similar to
   Hira mutants and abolish RI paternal chromatin assembly. In addition, we
   demonstrate that HIRA and YEM proteins interact and are mutually
   dependent for their targeting to the decondensing male pronucleus.
   Finally, we show that the alternative ATRX/XNP-dependent H3.3 deposition
   pathway is not involved in paternal chromatin assembly, thus underlining
   the specific implication of the HIRA/YEM complex for this essential step
   of zygote formation.

TI Decoupling nucleosome recognition from DNA binding dramatically alters
   the properties of the Chd1 chromatin remodeler
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Chromatin remodelers can either organize or disrupt nucleosomal arrays,
   yet the mechanisms specifying these opposing actions are not clear.
   Here, we show that the outcome of nucleosome sliding by Chd1 changes
   dramatically depending on how the chromatin remodeler is targeted to
   nucleosomes. Using a Chd1-streptavidin fusion remodeler, we found that
   targeting via biotinylated DNA resulted in directional sliding towards
   the recruitment site, whereas targeting via biotinylated histones
   produced a distribution of nucleosome positions. Remarkably, the fusion
   remodeler shifted nucleosomes with biotinylated histones up to 50bp off
   the ends of DNA and was capable of reducing negative supercoiling of
   plasmids containing biotinylated chromatin, similar to remodelling
   characteristics observed for SWI/SNF-type remodelers. These data suggest
   that forming a stable attachment to nucleosomes via histones, and thus
   lacking sensitivity to extranucleosomal DNA, seems to be sufficient for
   allowing a chromatin remodeler to possess SWI/SNF-like disruptive
   properties.

TI Association and CpG SNP analysis of HTR4 polymorphisms with suicidal
   behavior in subjects with schizophrenia
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB Suicide is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality rates in
   schizophrenia. Genetic and epigenetic factors have been reported to
   modulate the risk for suicide although the precise mechanism and
   magnitude of these contributions is unknown. Previous research indicates
   that suicide attempters present abnormalities in the serotonergic
   system. The present study aimed to identify genetic and epigenetic risk
   variants of the serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor gene (HTR4) for suicidal
   behavior. We included 234 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia. For
   this purpose, we analyzed 11 markers across HTR4 and performed genotype,
   haplotype and potential methylation analyses, correcting for clinical
   covariates and ethnic stratification. Three blocks were revealed from
   the LD analysis. Haplotypes in Block 3 were significantly associated
   with suicide attempt. The potential methylation analysis was not
   significant. Our results suggest that HTR4 polymorphisms may not play a
   major role in the susceptibility for suicidal behavior in subjects with
   schizophrenia. Moreover, although not significant, the CpG SNP potential
   methylation analysis would be informative for future methylation
   analysis on this gene.

TI Chromatin condensation dynamics and implications of induced premature
   chromosome condensation
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Somatic cell cycle is a dynamic process with sequential events that
   culminate in cell division. Several physiological activities occur in
   the cytoplasm and nucleus during each of the cell cycle phases which
   help in doubling of genetic content, organized arrangement of the
   duplicated genetic material and perfect mechanism for its equal
   distribution to the two daughter cells formed. Also, the cell cycle
   checkpoints ensure that the genetic material is devoid of damages thus
   ensuring unaltered transmission of genetic information. Two important
   phenomena occurring during the cell cycle are the DNA condensation and
   decondensation cycles in the nucleus along with the cyclic expression
   and functioning of certain specific proteins that help in the same.
   Several protein families including Cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases,
   condensins, cohesins and surivins ensure error free, stage specific DNA
   condensation and decondensation by their highly specific, controlled
   orchestrated presence and action. Understanding the molecular mechanisms
   of chromatin compaction towards formation of the structural units, the
   chromosomes, give us valuable insights into the cellular physiology and
   also direct us to techniques such as premature chromosome condensation.
   The techniques of inducing 'prophasing' of interphase cells are
   undergoing rapid advances which have multidimensional applications for
   basic research and direct applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Protection of cisplatin-induced spermatotoxicity, DNA damage and
   chromatin abnormality by selenium nano-particles
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Cisplatin (CIS), an anticancer alkylating agent, induces DNA adducts and
   effectively cross links the DNA strands and so affects spermatozoa as a
   male reproductive toxicant. The present study investigated the
   cellular/biochemical mechanisms underlying possible protective effect of
   selenium nano-particles (Nano-Se) as an established strong antioxidant
   with more bioavailability and less toxicity, on reproductive toxicity of
   CIS by assessment of sperm characteristics, sperm DNA integrity,
   chromatin quality and spermatogenic disorders. To determine the role of
   oxidative stress (OS) in the pathogenesis of CIS gonadotoxicity, the
   level of lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant enzymes including
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase
   (GSH-Px) and peroxynitrite (ONOO) as a marker of nitrosative stress (NS)
   and testosterone (T) concentration as a biomarker of testicular function
   were measured in the blood and testes. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were
   equally divided into four groups. A single IP dose of CIS (7 mg/kg) and
   protective dose of Nano-Se (2 mg/kg/day) were administered alone or in
   combination. The CIS-exposed rats showed a significant increase in
   testicular and serum LPO and ONOO level, along with a significant
   decrease in enzymatic antioxidants levels, diminished serum T
   concentration and abnormal histologic findings with impaired sperm
   quality associated with increased DNA damage and decreased chromatin
   quality. Coadministration of Nano-Se significantly improved the serum T,
   sperm quality, and spermatogenesis and reduced CIS-induced free radical
   toxic stress and spermatic DNA damage.
   In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that Nano-Se may be useful
   to prevent CIS-induced gonadotoxicity through its antioxidant potential.

TI Foscarnet reduces FGF2-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells and has antineoplastic activity against human
   anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB In contrast to many reports dealing with inhibitors of growth factor
   receptors like VEGF or FGFR, only few reports of low molecular weight
   inhibitors, which are directed against growth factors itself, are known.
   Here, foscarnet, an antiviral drug which inhibits several viral DNA
   polymerases by mimic pyrophosphate of nucleotides, was identified to
   interact with fibroblast growth factor 2 and stabilize the growth factor
   against tryptic digestion similar like the non-nitrogen containing
   bisphosphonates clodronate and etidronate that we have reported just
   recently as inhibitors of FGF-induced cell proliferation. Foscarnet
   competes with ATP against the binding on fibroblast growth factor 2 at
   the heparin/ATP-binding domain. This indicates binding of foscarnet at
   the heparin-binding domain of FGF2. This interaction of foscarnet with
   fibroblast growth factor 2 reduces FGF2-induced proliferation of human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells and intracellular signaling via ERK1/2
   kinases in this cell line. Additionally, foscarnet reduces in a
   dose-dependent manner proliferation of CAL-62 cells that belong to
   anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a rare but lethal type of thyroid cancer
   that expresses FGF2. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Rosmarinus officinalis polyphenols produce anti-depressant like effect
   through monoaminergic and cholinergic functions modulation
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Rosmarinus officinalis (R. officinalis), a culinary aromatic and
   medicinal plant, is very rich in polyphenols and flavonoids with high
   antioxidant properties. This plant was reported to exert multiple
   benefits for neuronal system and alleviate mood disorder. In our
   previous study, we demonstrated that R. officinalis and its active
   compounds, luteolin (Lut), carnosic acid (CA), and rosmarinic acid (RA),
   exhibited neurotrophic effects and improved cholinergic functions in
   PC12 cells in correlation with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
   ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The current study was conducted to evaluate
   and understand the anti-depressant effect of R. officinalis using tail
   suspension test (TST) in ICR mice and PC12 cells as in vitro neuronal
   model. Proteomics analysis of PC12 cells treated with R. officinalis
   polyphenols (ROP) Lut, CA, and RA revealed a significant upregulation of
   tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) two major genes
   involved in dopaminergic, serotonergic and GABAergic pathway
   regulations. Moreover, ROP were demonstrated to protect neuronal cells
   against corticosterone-induced toxicity. These results were concordant
   with decreasing immobility time in TST and regulation of several
   neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and
   acetylcholine) and gene expression in mice brain like TH, PC and MAPK
   phosphatase (MKP-1). To the best of our knowledge this is the first
   evidence to contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanism
   behind the anti-depressant effect of R. officinalis and its major active
   compounds. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Fat or lean: adjustment of endogenous energy stores to predictable and
   unpredictable changes in allostatic load
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB The ability to store energy endogenously is an important ecological
   mechanism that allows animals to buffer predictable and unpredictable
   variation in allostatic load. The secretion of glucocorticoids, which
   reflects changes in allostatic load, is suggested to play a major role
   in the adjustment of endogenous stores to these varying conditions.
   Although crucially important, the relationship between allostatic load
   and energy stores remains largely unexplored. Two contrasting hypotheses
   describe how stores may be adjusted: animals may use low allostatic
   loads to increase stores to a maximum possible (fat and fit), or they
   can attain a lean physique due to fitness advantages of a low body mass
   (lean and fit). We compiled observational and experimental data
   available for a long-lived seabird to examine the relationship between
   glucocorticoids and stored energy at two life history stages (incubation
   and chick-rearing). Data were collected across multiple years and
   colonies in the North Pacific, thereby reflecting the wide range of
   environmental conditions birds' encounter in the marine environment.
   During experimental manipulations, allostatic load was minimized by
   supplementing food to free-living birds. We found that the relationship
   between allostatic load and energy stores was clearly curvilinear at
   both life history stages. Observational data suggested that energy
   stores remained relatively stable under low allostatic load and
   decreased under high loads. Experimental data showed that birds did not
   maximize energy stores under favourable conditions but maintained energy
   stores below a physiologically attainable level. Energy stores remained
   consistently lower during chick-rearing compared to incubation across
   the wide range of variations in allostatic load suggesting that
   stage-specific trade-offs limit the accumulation of energy during
   favourable environmental conditions. Secretion of glucocorticoids did
   not appear to mediate this shift in energy stores between the life
   history stages. Overall, results of this study support the lean and fit
   hypothesis. We conclude that increased energy stores may not necessarily
   reflect better environmental conditions experienced by individuals or
   predict their higher fitness. A major advantage of adopting a lean
   physique when environmental conditions allow may be the avoidance of
   additional energetic costs for moving a heavy body. In breeding
   seabirds, this advantage may be more important during chick-rearing. In
   the focal species, the secretion of glucocorticoids might be involved in
   regulation of energy stores within a life history stage but does not
   appear to mediate an adaptive shift in energy stores between the
   incubating and chick-rearing stages of reproduction.

TI Dissecting molecular stress networks: identifying nodes of divergence
   between life-history phenotypes
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB The complex molecular network that underlies physiological stress
   response is comprised of nodes (proteins, metabolites, mRNAs, etc.)
   whose connections span cells, tissues and organs. Variable nodes are
   points in the network upon which natural selection may act. Thus,
   identifying variable nodes will reveal how this molecular stress network
   may evolve among populations in different habitats and how it might
   impact life-history evolution. Here, we use physiological and genetic
   assays to test whether laboratory-born juveniles from natural
   populations of garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans), which have diverged
   in their life-history phenotypes, vary concomitantly at candidate nodes
   of the stress response network, (i) under unstressed conditions and (ii)
   in response to an induced stress. We found that two common measures of
   stress (plasma corticosterone and liver gene expression of heat shock
   proteins) increased under stress in both life-history phenotypes. In
   contrast, the phenotypes diverged at four nodes both under unstressed
   conditions and in response to stress: circulating levels of reactive
   oxygen species (superoxide, H2O2); liver gene expression of GPX1 and
   erythrocyte DNA damage. Additionally, allele frequencies for SOD2
   diverge from neutral markers, suggesting diversifying selection on SOD2
   alleles. This study supports the hypothesis that these life-history
   phenotypes have diverged at the molecular level in how they respond to
   stress, particularly in nodes regulating oxidative stress. Furthermore,
   the differences between the life-history phenotypes were more pronounced
   in females. We discuss the responses to stress in the context of the
   associated life-history phenotype and the evolutionary pressures thought
   to be responsible for divergence between the phenotypes.

TI Behavioural, neurochemical and neuroendocrine effects of the endogenous
   beta-carboline harmane in fear-conditioned rats
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB The putative endogenous imidazoline binding site ligand harmane enhances
   neuronal activation in response to psychological stress and alters
   behaviour in animal models of anxiety and antidepressant efficacy.
   However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying harmane's
   psychotropic effects are poorly understood. We investigated the effects
   of intraperitoneal injection of harmane (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) on
   fear-conditioned behaviour, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity,
   and monoaminergic activity within specific fear-associated areas of the
   rat brain. Harmane had no significant effect on the duration of
   contextually induced freezing or 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations and did
   not alter the contextually induced suppression of motor activity,
   including rearing. Harmane reduced the duration of rearing and tended to
   increase freezing in non-fear-conditioned controls, suggesting potential
   sedative effects. Harmane increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone
   concentrations, and serotonin (in hypothalamus, amygdaloid cortex,
   prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) and noradrenaline (prefrontal cortex)
   content, irrespective of fear-conditioning. Furthermore, harmane reduced
   dopamine and serotonin turnover in the PFC and hypothalamus, and
   serotonin turnover in the amygdaloid cortex in both fear-conditioned and
   non-fear-conditioned rats. In contrast, harmane increased dopamine and
   noradrenaline content and reduced dopamine turnover in the amygdala of
   fear-conditioned rats only, suggesting differential effects on
   catecholaminergic transmission in the presence and absence of fear. The
   precise mechanism(s) mediating these effects of harmane remain to be
   determined but may involve its inhibitory action on monoamine oxidases.
   These findings support a role for harmane as a neuromodulator, altering
   behaviour, brain neurochemistry and neuroendocrine function.

TI Differential contribution of HP1 proteins to DNA end resection and
   homology-directed repair
SO CELL CYCLE
AB Heterochromatin protein 1 paralogs (HP1 alpha, beta and gamma in
   mammals) are not only central in heterochromatin organization, but have
   also been linked to transcriptional activation at euchromatic regions,
   maintenance of telomere stability and, most recently, to the DNA damage
   response (DDR). However, how HP1 proteins contribute to the DDR at a
   molecular level, and whether HP1 paralogs within the same organism, as
   well as their respective orthologs, have overlapping or unique roles in
   the DDR, remain to be elucidated. Herein, we have combined the analysis
   of the efficiency and kinetics of recruitment of key repair proteins to
   sites of DNA damage with specific DNA repair assays to demonstrate that
   human HP1 paralogs differentially modulate homology-directed repair
   (HDR) pathways, including homologous recombination (HR) and
   single-strand annealing (SSA). We find that while HP1 alpha and beta
   stimulate HR and SSA, HP1 gamma has an inhibitory role. In addition, we
   show that the stimulatory role of HP1 alpha and beta in HDR is linked to
   the DNA-end resection step of DNA breaks, through the promotion of RPA
   loading and phosphorylation at damage sites. Altogether, our findings
   provide mechanistic insight into how human HP1 proteins participate in
   the recombination process, emerging as important chromatin regulators
   during HDR.

   Chronic mild stress alters circadian expressions of molecular clock
   genes in the liver. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 304: E301-E309, 2013.
   First published December 4, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00388.2012.-Chronic stress is well known to affect
   metabolic regulation. However, molecular mechanisms interconnecting
   stress response systems and metabolic regulations have yet to be
   elucidated. Various physiological processes, including glucose/lipid
   metabolism, are regulated by the circadian clock, and core clock gene
   dysregulation reportedly leads to metabolic disorders. Glucocorticoids,
   acting as end- effectors of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   axis, entrain the circadian rhythms of peripheral organs, including the
   liver, by phase-shifting core clock gene expressions. Therefore, we
   examined whether chronic stress affects circadian expressions of core
   clock genes and metabolism-related genes in the liver using the chronic
   mild stress (CMS) procedure. In BALB/c mice, CMS elevated and
   phase-shifted serum corticosterone levels, indicating overactivation of
   the HPA axis. The rhythmic expressions of core clock genes, e.g., Clock,
   Npas2, Bmal1, Per1, and Cry1, were altered in the liver while being
   completely preserved in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuculeus (SCN),
   suggesting that the SCN is not involved in alterations in hepatic core
   clock gene expressions. In addition, circadian patterns of glucose and
   lipid metabolism-related genes, e.g., peroxisome proliferator activated
   receptor (Ppar) alpha, Ppar gamma-1, Ppar gamma-coactivator-1 alpha, and
   phosphoenolepyruvate carboxykinase, were also disturbed by CMS. In
   contrast, in C57BL/6 mice, the same CMS procedure altered neither serum
   corticosterone levels nor rhythmic expressions of hepatic core clock
   genes and metabolism-related genes. Thus, chronic stress can interfere
   with the circadian expressions of both core clock genes and
   metabolism-related genes in the liver possibly involving HPA axis
   overactivation. This mechanism might contribute to metabolic disorders
   in stressful modern societies.

TI Lost in translation. New unexplored avenues for neuropsychopharmacology:
   epigenetics and microRNAs
SO EXPERT OPINION ON INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS
AB Introduction: Mood and anxiety disorders are among the major causes of
   disability worldwide. Despite clear need for better therapies, efforts
   to develop novel drugs have been relatively unsuccessful. One major
   reason is lack of translation into neuropsychopharmacology of the
   impressive recent array of knowledge accrued by clinical and preclinical
   researches on the brain. Here focus is on epigenetics mechanisms,
   including microRNAs, which seem particularly promising for the
   identification of new targets for alternative pharmacological
   approaches.
   Areas covered: First, the current knowledge about epigenetic mechanisms,
   including DNA methylation, posttranslational modification of histone
   proteins, focusing on histone methylation and acetylation, and
   posttranscriptional modulation of gene expression by microRNAs is
   described. Then evidence showing involvement of epigenetics and
   microRNAs in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders as well
   as evidence showing that some of the currently employed antidepressants
   and mood stabilizers also affect epigenetic and microRNA mechanisms are
   reviewed. Finally current evidence and novel approaches in favor of
   drugs regulating epigenetic and microRNA mechanisms as potential
   therapeutics for these disorders are discussed.
   Expert opinion: Although still in its infancy, research investigating
   the effects of pharmacological modulation of epigenetic and microRNA
   mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders continues to provide
   encouraging findings, suggesting new avenues for treatment of mood and
   anxiety disorders.

TI Chronic, but not acute, ethanol exposure impairs central hypercapnic
   ventilatory drive in bullfrog tadpoles
SO RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Chronic ethanol exposure early in development is deleterious to neural
   development and may impair responses to ventilatory stimuli (ventilatory
   drive) that maintain homeostasis. Central hypercapnic ventilatory drive
   (CHVD) increases ventilation to ensure pH homeostasis and accommodate
   the metabolic production of CO(2). We tested the hypothesis that chronic
   ethanol exposure impairs CHVD in bullfrog tadpoles. Early and late
   metamorphic tadpoles were exposed in vivo to 0.12-0.06 g/dL ethanol for
   either 3- or 10-wk durations. Brainstems from these animals were
   isolated and the neural correlates of ventilation were recorded in vitro
   during superfusion with normocapnic (1.5% CO(2):98.5% O(2)) and
   hypercapnic (5.0% CO(2):95.0% O(2)) artificial cerebral spinal fluid.
   Normocapnic neuroventilation was unaffected by chronic ethanol exposure.
   The typical response to hypercapnia, an increase in lung burst
   frequency, was lost following 10 but not 3 wk of ethanol exposure in
   both early and late metamorphic tadpoles. The neuroventilatory effects
   of chronic ethanol exposure were distinguishable from those of acute
   central ethanol (0.08 g/dL) exposure, which attenuated early metamorphic
   tadpole normocapnic neuroventilation, but had no effect on tadpole CHVD.
   Thus, 10 wk of ethanol exposure both early and late in metamorphosis
   impairs CHVD in bullfrog tadpoles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY-BIOCHIMIE ET BIOLOGIE CELLULAIRE
AB Recent studies in transcriptional regulation using the Drosophila heat
   shock response system have elucidated many of the dynamic regulatory
   processes that govern transcriptional activation and repression. The
   classic view that the control of gene expression occurs at the point of
   RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment is now giving way to a more
   complex outlook of gene regulation. Promoter chromatin dynamics
   coordinate with transcription factor binding to maintain the promoters
   of active genes accessible. For a large number of genes, the
   rate-limiting step in Pol II progression occurs during its initial
   elongation, where Pol II transcribes 30-50 bp and pauses for further
   signals. These paused genes have unique genic chromatin architecture and
   dynamics compared with genes where Pol II recruitment is rate limiting
   for expression. Further elongation of Pol II along the gene causes
   nucleosome turnover, a continuous process of eviction and replacement,
   which suggests a potential mechanism for Pol II transit along a
   nucleosomal template. In this review, we highlight recent insights into
   transcription regulation of the heat shock response and discuss how the
   dynamic regulatory processes involved at each transcriptional stage help
   to generate faithful yet highly responsive gene expression.

TI Linking nutrition and sexual selection across life stages in a model
   butterfly system
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Early nutrition plays an important role in determining adult fitness.
   Theory proposes that in organisms with complex life cycles, the fitness
   effects of larval nutritional constraints are mainly captured by two
   developmental traits: time and size at metamorphosis. However, recent
   evidence suggests that latent effects, which are independent of these
   developmental traits, must be included to fully understand how larval
   nutrition impacts fitness. In this study, I used the cabbage butterfly
   (Pieris rapae) as a model system to investigate how larval nutrition
   influences male fitness through development time, adult size and latent
   effects. Specifically, I examined how variation in dietary nitrogen
   impacts male fitness by measuring a comprehensive suite of pre- and
   postcopulatory traits. Results indicate a complex role for larval
   nutrition in determining adult fitness. Larval nutritional constraints
   influence adult fitness through three different pathways: development
   time, adult size and latent effects. Longer development times were
   associated with shorter adult life span and reduced male mating success.
   Body size was positively correlated with traits related to
   postcopulatory fitness, such as spermatophore size and protein content.
   Larval nitrogen availability, independent of the developmental traits,
   also affected traits associated with male mating success such as wing
   coloration and latency to first mating. These results provide new
   insights into how larval nitrogen availability alters adult fitness by
   revealing novel links between larval dietary nitrogen and various adult
   fitness components.

TI Targeting gene expression to the female larval fat body of transgenic

SO INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB As the fat body is a critical tissue for mosquito development,
   metamorphosis, immune and reproductive system function, the
   characterization of regulatory modules targeting gene expression to the
   female mosquito fat body at distinct life stages is much needed for
   multiple, varied strategies for controlling vector-borne diseases such
   as dengue and malaria. The hexameric storage protein, Hexamerin-1.2, of
   the mosquito Aedes atropalpus is female-specific and uniquely expressed
   in the fat body of fourth instar larvae and young adults. We have
   identified in the Hex-1.2 gene, a short regulatory module that directs
   female-, tissue-, and stage-specific lacZ reporter gene expression using
   a heterologous promoter in transgenic lines of the dengue vector Aedes
   aegypti. Male transgenic larvae and pupae of one line expressed no
   Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase or transgene product; in two other
   lines reporter gene activity was highly female-biased. All transgenic
   lines expressed the reporter only in the fat body; however, lacZ mRNA
   levels were no different in males and females at any stage examined,
   suggesting that the gene regulatory module drives female-specific
   expression by post-transcriptional regulation in the heterologous
   mosquito. This regulatory element from the Hex-1.2 gene thus provides a
   new molecular tool for transgenic mosquito control as well as functional
   genetic analysis in aedine mosquitoes.

TI Transcription factor and chromatin features predict genes associated

SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Cell type-specific gene expression in humans involves complex
   interactions between regulatory factors and DNA at enhancers and
   promoters. Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci
   (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become
   widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but
   prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate
   genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional
   annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the
   random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF
   and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1
   megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes,
   proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes > 150
   kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and
   functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators.
   Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the
   specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at
   most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only
   provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight
   into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can
   influence gene expression.

   and Kurthia in adult flies. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were screened
   using a selective medium and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Most
   resistant isolates from maggots and pupae were classified as Proteus
   spp., while those from adult flies were much more diverse and spanned 12
   genera. Among 20 tested strains across the three stages, 18 were
   resistant to at least two antibiotics. Overall, we demonstrated that
   there are changes in the major bacterial communities and
   antibiotic-resistant strains as the housefly develops.

TI Meiotic gene expression initiates during larval development in the sea
   urchin
SO DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS
AB Background: Meiosis is a unique mechanism in gamete production and a
   fundamental process shared by all sexually reproducing eukaryotes.
   Meiosis requires several specialized and highly conserved genes whose
   expression can also identify the germ cells undergoing gametogenic
   differentiation. Sea urchins are echinoderms, which form a phylogenetic
   sister group of chordates. Sea urchin embryos undergo a feeding,
   planktonic larval phase in which they construct an adult rudiment prior
   to metamorphosis. Although a series of conserved meiosis genes (e.g.,
   dmc1, msh5, rad21, rad51, and sycp1) is expressed in sea urchin oocytes,
   we sought to determine when in development meiosis would first be
   initiated. Results: We surveyed the expression of several meiotic genes
   and their corresponding proteins in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
   purpuratus. Surprisingly, meiotic genes are highly expressed not only in
   ovaries but beginning in larvae. Both RNA and protein localizations
   strongly suggest that meiotic gene expression initiates in tissues that
   will eventually give rise to the adult rudiment of the late larva.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that broad expression of the
   molecules associated with meiotic differentiation initiates prior to
   metamorphosis and may have additional functions in these cells, or
   mechanisms repressing their function, until later in development when
   gametogenesis begins. Developmental Dynamics, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

TI OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in
   rice
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB Flowering is exquisitely regulated by both promotive and inhibitory
   factors. Molecular genetic studies with Arabidopsis have verified
   several epigenetic repressors that regulate flowering time. However, the
   roles of chromatin remodeling factors in developmental processes have
   not been well explored in Oryza sativa (rice). We identified a chromatin
   remodeling factor OsVIL2 (O.sativa VIN3-LIKE2) that promotes flowering.
   OsVIL2 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a conserved
   motif of histone binding proteins. Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused
   late flowering under both long and short days. In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1
   expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced.
   We demonstrated that OsVIL2 is bound to native histone H3 in vitro.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsVIL2 was directly
   associated with OsLFL1 chromatin. We also observed that H3K27me3 was
   significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that
   this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants. These results
   indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression. We
   showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of
   polycomb repression complex2. As observed from osvil2, a null mutation
   of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and
   decreasing Ehd1 expression. Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions
   together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1.

TI Beclin 1 Enhances Proteasome Inhibition-Mediated Cytotoxicity of Thyroid
   Cancer Cells in Macroautophagy-Independent Manner
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: The ubiquitin-proteasome system and macroautophagy are two
   major pathways for intracellular protein degradation. Emerging lines of
   evidence have shown that blockade of ubiquitin-proteasome system by
   proteasome inhibitors activates macroautophagy.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of
   autophagy essential gene Beclin 1 in cytotoxicity of thyroid cancer
   cells mediated by proteasome inhibitors.
   Design: Autophagy was measured by acidic-trophic dye staining and
   EGF-LC3 distribution using fluorescence microscopy, as well as LC3-II
   transition using Western blot. To ascertain the effect of Beclin 1,
   cells were transfected with Beclin 1 plasmid or shRNA against Beclin 1.
   Cell viability and apoptotic cells were measured using MTT assay and
   flow cytometry, respectively.
   Results: Proteasome inhibitors decreased Beclin 1 expression. In
   addition, treatment with PI3K inhibitors 3-MA or wortmannin, as well as
   knockdown of Beclin 1 expression, was unable to affect autophagic
   responses mediated by proteasome inhibitors. Overexpression of Beclin 1
   enhanced proteasome inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity of thyroid cancer
   cells via suppression of survivin.
   Conclusions: Proteasome inhibitors cause Beclin 1-independent
   macroautophagic responses of thyroid cancer cells in a Beclin
   1-independent manner. Beclin 1 possesses autophagy-independent
   antitumoral effects upon exposure of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome
   inhibitors. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: E217-E226, 2013)

TI Infant's bilobar thyroid agenesis and mother's I-131 accidental
   administration
SO ANNALES D ENDOCRINOLOGIE
AB Bilobar thyroid agenesis is one of rare diseases. Genetic and
   environmental factors may associate with bilobar thyroid agenesis. But
   the mechanism is still not completely understood. It had been showed
   that I-131 administration during pregnancy may induce thyroid
   dysfunction in newborn. Here we reported a case of female hospital staff
   who received I-131 accidently during (10-12th gestational weeks) and
   after her pregnancy. The absorbed dose to fetus was higher than 30 mGy.
   At birth, the infant was found to have no thyroid. It was speculated
   that the fetal thyroid agenesis may be related with mother' I-131
   administration during pregnancy. In addition, this case report also
   indicated that the radiation dose should be minimized to any developing
   embryo. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Genome-wide Chromatin State Transitions Associated with Developmental
   and Environmental Cues
SO CELL
AB Differences in chromatin organization are key to the multiplicity of
   cell states that arise from a single genetic background, yet the
   landscapes of in vivo tissues remain largely uncharted. Here, we mapped
   chromatin genome-wide in a large and diverse collection of human tissues
   and stem cells. The maps yield unprecedented annotations of functional
   genomic elements and their regulation across developmental stages,
   lineages, and cellular environments. They also reveal global features of
   the epigenome, related to nuclear architecture, that also vary across
   cellular phenotypes. Specifically, developmental specification is
   accompanied by progressive chromatin restriction as the default state
   transitions from dynamic remodeling to generalized compaction. Exposure
   to serum in vitro triggers a distinct transition that involves de novo
   establishment of domains with features of constitutive heterochromatin.
   We describe how these global chromatin state transitions relate to
   chromosome and nuclear architecture, and discuss their implications for
   lineage fidelity, cellular senescence, and reprogramming.

TI Comparison of the chemical composition and biological effects of the
   roots, branches and leaves of Heteropterys tomentosa A. Juss
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Heteropterys tomentosa: A. Juss
   (Malpighiaceae), commonly mistaken as Heteroptezys aphrodisiaca, is
   chronically used by the Brazilian population to improve general health
   due to its claimed protective effects against a wide range of medical
   conditions.
   Aim of the study: This study in rodents aimed to verify the adaptogenic
   potential of the hydroalcoholic extracts of the roots (the most commonly
   used portion), branches and leaves of the plant.
   Materials and methods: The phytochemical constitution of the extracts
   was analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and high-performance
   liquid chromatography. Restriction- and cold-induced stress in rats
   treated for 14 days with 100 or 300 mg/kg of the extracts were used to
   evaluate parameters such as ulceration, adrenals, thymus and spleen
   weights, as well as ACTH and corticosterone plasmatic levels. The stress
   response also was evaluated in mice by self-analgesia induced by
   restraint stress, after 7 days of treatment at doses of 100 and 300
   mg/kg. The learning and memory of aged rats treated with extracts of
   root or branches at the dose of 50 mg/kg for 80 days were evaluated in
   the elevated T-maze test.
   Results: The chemical constituents of the three parts of the plant were
   relatively similar in the presence of saponins, hydrolysable tannins,
   flavonoids, polyphenols and triterpenes. None of the three extracts were
   capable of protecting the stomach from ulcerations in rats submitted to
   cold restraint stress or protecting from alterations in adrenal or
   spleen weight (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the extracts did not inhibit
   increases in plasma levels of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic
   hormone. Moreover, the extracts did not inhibit self-analgesia induced
   by restraint stress in mice and did not improve the performance of aged
   rats in the T-maze test (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The tests employed in this study did not show evidence of
   adaptogenic activity in the three extracts of Heteropterys tomentosa.

TI Equine spermatozoa stored in the epididymis for up to 96 h at 4 degrees
   C can be successfully cryopreserved and maintain their fertilization
   capacity
SO ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB After injury or death of a valuable male, recovery of epididymal
   spermatozoa may be the last chance to ensure preservation of its genetic
   material. The objective of this research was to study the effect of
   sperm storage, at 4 degrees C up to 96 h, in the epididymides obtained
   from castrated horses and its effect on different functional sperm
   parameters. Aims were to study the effect of (1) sperm storage on
   viability and chromatin condensation; (2) pre-incubation of recovered
   epididymal sperm in the freezing extender, prior cryopreservation, on
   viability and chromatin condensation; and (3) freezing-thawing on
   viability, chromatin condensation, ROS generation, protein tyrosine
   phosphorylation and heterologous fertilization rate (ICSI and IVF using
   bovine oocytes) of sperm recovered from the epididymis up to 96 h post
   castration. The average volume (720 +/- 159 mu L) and the concentration
   (6.5 +/- 0.4 x 10(9) spermatozoa/mL) of sperm recovered from the
   epididymis were not affected by storage. Sperm viability after
   refrigeration at 4 degrees C for up to 72 h was similar (P < 0.01). The
   effect of sperm dilution in the freezing media showed similar values up
   to 48 h, while viability was preserved up to 72 h (P < 0.01).
   Cryopreserved spermatozoa show similar viability between different
   storage times. Chromatin condensation was not affected by storage time;
   however, incubation for 30 min in freezing medium and freezing-thawing
   process induced an increase in the chromatin decondensation. ROS
   generation was not affected by storage up to 96 h. Epididymal storage
   did not affect sperm protein tyrosine phosphorylation patterns; although
   the pattern of phosphorylation changed to strong staining of the
   equatorial segment when the sperm where capacitated in sperm-TALP.
   Finally, successful and similar pronuclear formation (analyzed by ICSI)
   and in vitro penetration (evaluated with bovine zone free oocyte) was
   observed using cryopreserved sperm obtained from prolong epididymal
   storage at 4 degrees C. In conclusion, cryopreservation of epididymal
   stallion sperm stored for up to 72 h in the epididymis at 4 degrees C,
   maintain both viability and ability to fertilize in vitro. (C) 2012

TI Control of transposon activity by a histone H3K4 demethylase in rice
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitously present in plant genomes
   and often account for significant fractions of the nuclear DNA. For
   example, roughly 40% of the rice genome consists of TEs, many of which
   are retrotransposons, including 14% LTR- and similar to 1% non-LTR
   retrotransposons. Despite their wide distribution and abundance, very
   few TEs have been found to be transpositional, indicating that TE
   activities may be tightly controlled by the host genome to minimize the
   potentially mutagenic effects associated with active transposition.
   Consistent with this notion, a growing body of evidence suggests that
   epigenetic silencing pathways such as DNA methylation; RNA interference,
   and H3K9me2 function collectively to repress TE activity at the
   transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. It is not yet clear,
   however, whether the removal of histone modifications associated with
   active transcription is also involved in TE silencing. Here, we show
   that the rice protein JMJ703 is an active H3K4-specific demethylase
   required for TEs silencing. Impaired JMJ703 activity led to elevated
   levels of H3K4me3, the misregulation of numerous endogenous genes, and
   the transpositional reactivation of two families of non-LTR
   retrotransposons. interestingly, loss of JMJ703 did not affect TEs (such
   as Tos17) previously found to be silenced by other epigenetic pathways.
   These results indicate that the removal of active histone modifications
   is involved in TE silencing and that different subsets of TEs may be
   regulated by distinct epigenetic pathways.

TI The nuclear cofactor RAC3/AIB1/SRC-3 enhances Nrf2 signaling by
   interacting with transactivation domains
SO ONCOGENE
AB Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, NM 006164, 605 AA) is
   essential for the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-mediated
   expression of a group of detoxifying antioxidant genes that detoxify
   carcinogens and protect against oxidative stress. Several proteins have
   been identified as Nrf2-interacting molecules. In this study, we found
   that the overexpression of receptor-associated coactivator 3
   (RAC3)/AIB-1/steroid receptor coactivator-3, a nuclear coregulator and
   oncogene frequently amplified in human breast cancers, induced heme
   oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through Nrf2 transactivation in HeLa cells. Next, we
   determined the interaction between RAC3 and Nrf2 proteins using a
   co-immunoprecipitation assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer
   analysis. The results showed that RAC3 bound directly to the Nrf2
   protein in the nucleus. Subsequently, we identified the interacting
   domains of Nrf2 and RAC3 using a gintathione S-transferase pull-down
   assay. The results showed that both the N-terminal RAC3-pasB and
   C-terminal RAC3-R3B3 domains were tightly bound to the Neh4 and Neh5
   transactivation domains. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation
   showed that RAC3 bound tightly to the ARE enhancer region of the HO-1
   promoter via Nrf2 binding. These data suggest that Nrf2 activation is
   modulated and directly controlled through interactions with the RAC3
   protein in HeLa cells. Oncogene (2013) 32, 514-527;

TI Phosphorylation and Recruitment of BAF60c in Chromatin Remodeling for
   Lipogenesis in Response to Insulin
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis is induced in response to feeding
   and insulin. This lipogenic induction involves coordinate
   transcriptional activation of lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid
   synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. We recently reported
   the importance of USF-1 phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation in
   insulin-induced lipogenic gene activation. Here, we show that
   Brg1/Brm-associated factor (BAF) 60c is a specific chromatin remodeling
   component for lipogenic gene transcription in liver. In response to
   insulin, BAF60c is phosphorylated at S247 by atypical PKC zeta/lambda,
   which causes translocation of BAF60c to the nucleus and allows a direct
   interaction of BAF60c with USF-1 that is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and
   acetylated by P/CAF. Thus, BAF60c is recruited to form the lipoBAF
   complex to remodel chromatin structure and to activate lipogenic genes.
   Consequently, BAF60c promotes lipogenesis in vivo and increases
   triglyceride levels, demonstrating its role in metabolic adaption to
   activate the lipogenic program in response to feeding and insulin.

TI STAT3 suppresses transcription of proapoptotic genes in cancer cells
   with the involvement of its N-terminal domain
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Activation of STAT3 in cancers leads to gene expression promoting cell
   proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, as well as tumor
   angiogenesis, invasion, and migration. In the characterization of
   effects of ST3-H2A2, a selective inhibitor of the STAT3 N-terminal
   domain (ND), we observed that the compound induced apoptotic death in
   cancer cells associated with robust activation of proapoptotic genes.
   Using ChIP and tiling human promoter arrays, we found that activation of
   gene expression in response to ST3-H2A2 is accompanied by altered STAT3
   chromatin binding. Using inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation and a
   dominant-negative STAT3 mutant, we found that the unphosphorylated form
   of STAT3 binds to regulatory regions of proapoptotic genes and prevents
   their expression in tumor cells but not normal cells. siRNA knockdown
   confirmed the effects of ST3-HA2A on gene expression and chromatin
   binding to be STAT3 dependent. The STAT3-binding region of the
   C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) promoter was found to be localized in
   DNaseI hypersensitive site of chromatin in cancer cells but not in
   nontransformed cells, suggesting that STAT3 binding and suppressive
   action can be chromatin structure dependent. These data demonstrate a
   suppressive role for the STAT3 ND in the regulation of proapoptotic gene
   expression in cancer cells, providing further support for targeting
   STAT3 ND for cancer therapy.

TI Hypoxia-inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1)-independent Hypoxia Response of the
   Small Heat Shock Protein hsp-16.1 Gene Regulated by Chromatin-remodeling
   Factors in the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Oxygen deprivation is accompanied by the coordinated expression of
   numerous hypoxia-responsive genes, many of which are controlled by
   hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). However, the cellular response to
   hypoxia is not likely to be mediated by HIF-1 alone, and little is known
   about HIF-1-independent hypoxia responses. To better establish the
   molecular mechanisms of HIF-1-independent hypoxia responses, we sought
   to characterize the molecular basis of the hypoxia response of the
   hsp-16.1 gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; this gene has been
   shown to be induced by hypoxia independently of hif-1. Using affinity
   purification followed by LC-MS/MS, we identified HMG-1.2 as a protein
   that binds to a specific promoter region under hypoxic conditions. By
   systematic prediction followed by validation of these interactions
   through RNAi, we identified the chromatin modifiers isw-1 and hda-1,
   histone H4, and NURF-1 chromatin-remodeling factors as new components of
   the hif-1-independent hypoxia response. These data suggest that the
   modulation of nucleosome positioning at the hsp-16.1 promoter may be
   important for the hypoxia response. In addition, we found that
   calcineurin acts independently of hif-1 to modulate the cellular
   response to hypoxia and that calcium ions are necessary for the
   induction of hsp-16.1 under hypoxic conditions.

   functions in gastric cancer. ZNF331 was silenced or downregulated in 71%
   (12/17) gastric cancer cell lines. A significant downregulation was also
   detected in paired gastric tumors compared with adjacent non-cancer
   tissues. In contrast, ZNF331 was readily expressed in various normal
   adult tissues. The downregulation of ZNF331 was closely linked to the
   promoter hypermethylation as evidenced by methylation-specific PCR,
   bisulfite genomic sequencing and reexpression by demethylation agent
   treatment. DNA sequencing showed no genetic mutation/deletion of ZNF331
   in gastric cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of ZNF331 in the
   silenced cancer cell lines MKN28 and HCT116 significantly reduced colony
   formation and cell viability, induced cell cycle arrests and repressed
   cell migration and invasive ability. Concordantly, knockdown of ZNF331
   increased cell viability and colony formation ability of gastric cancer
   cell line MKN45. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass
   spectrometry-based comparative proteomic approach were applied to
   analyze the molecular basis of the biological functions of ZNF331. In
   all, 10 downstream targets of ZNF331 were identified to be associated
   with regulation of cell growth and metastasis. The tumor-suppressive
   effect of ZNF331 is mediated at least by downregulation of genes
   involved in cell growth promotion (DSTN, EIF5A, GARS, DDX5, STAM,
   UQCRFS1 and SET) and migration/invasion (DSTN and ACTR3), and
   upregulation of genome-stability gene (SSBP1) and cellular senescence
   gene (PNPT1). A novel target of ZNF331 (DSTN) was functionally
   validated. Overexpression of DSTN in BGC-823 cells increased colony
   formation and migration ability. In conclusion, our results suggest that
   ZNF331 possesses important functions for the suppression of gastric
   carcinogenesis as a novel functional tumor-suppressor gene. Oncogene

TI Olig2 Targets Chromatin Remodelers to Enhancers to Initiate
   Oligodendrocyte Differentiation
SO CELL
AB Establishment of oligodendrocyte identity is crucial for subsequent
   events of myelination in the CNS. Here, we demonstrate that activation
   of ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzyme Smarca4/Brg1 at the
   differentiation onset is necessary and sufficient to initiate and
   promote oligodendrocyte lineage progression and maturation. Genome-wide
   multistage studies by ChIP-seq reveal that oligodendrocyte-lineage
   determination factor Olig2 functions as a prepatterning factor to direct
   Smarca4/Brg1 to oligodendrocyte-specific enhancers. Recruitment of
   Smarca4/Brg1 to distinct subsets of myelination regulatory genes is
   developmentally regulated. Functional analyses of Smarca4/Brg1 and Olig2
   co-occupancy relative to chromatin epigenetic marking uncover
   stage-specific cis-regulatory elements that predict sets of
   transcriptional regulators controlling oligodendrocyte differentiation.
   Together, our results demonstrate that regulation of the functional
   specificity and activity of a Smarca4/Brg1-dependent
   chromatin-remodeling complex by Olig2, coupled with transcriptionally
   linked chromatin modifications, is critical to precisely initiate and
   establish the transcriptional program that promotes oligodendrocyte
   differentiation and subsequent myelination of the CNS.

TI Genome-Wide Epigenetic Regulation of miRNAs in Cancer
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression contributes to tumorigenesis and
   cancer progression. Although the number of reported deregulated miRNAs
   in various cancer types is growing fast, the underlying mechanisms of
   aberrant miRNA regulation are still poorly studied. Epigenetic
   alterations including aberrant DNA methylation deregulate miRNA
   expression, which was first shown by reexpression of miRNAs upon
   pharmacologic DNA demethylation. However, studying the influence of DNA
   methylation on miRNA transcription on a genome-wide level was hampered
   by poor miRNA promoter annotation. Putative miRNA promoters were
   identified on a genome-wide level by using common promoter surrogate
   markers (e.g., histone modifications) and were later validated as such
   in different tumor entities. Integrating promoter datasets and global
   DNA methylation analysis revealed an extensive influence of DNA hyper-
   as well as hypomethylation on miRNA regulation. In this review, we
   summarize the current knowledge of the field and discuss recent efforts
   to map miRNA promoter sequences and to determine the contribution of
   epigenetic mechanisms to the regulation of miRNA expression. We discuss
   examples of tumor suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs such as the miR-34
   and miR-21 family, respectively, which highlight the complexity and
   consequences of epigenetic miRNA deregulation. Cancer Res; 73(2); 473-7.

TI Physiologic implications of inter-hormonal interference in fish: Lessons
   from the interaction of adrenaline with cortisol and thyroid hormones in
   climbing perch (Anabas testudineus Bloch)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Adrenaline and cortisol, the major stress hormones, are known for its
   direct control on stress response in fish. Likewise, as an important
   stress modifier hormone, thyroid hormone has also been implicated in
   stress response of fish. We tested whether the hypothesis on the
   phenomenon of inter-hormonal interference, a process that explains the
   hormonal interactions, operates in fish particularly between adrenaline,
   cortisol and thyroid hormones. To achieve this goal, indices of
   acid-base, osmotic and metabolic regulations were quantified after
   adrenaline challenge in propranolol pre-treated air-breathing fish
   (Anabas testudineus). Short-term adrenaline (10 ng g(-1)) injection for
   30 min produced a rise in plasma cortisol without affecting plasma T(3)
   and T(4). On the contrary, blocking of adrenaline action with a
   non-selective blocker, propranolol (25 ng g(-1)) for 90 min reduced
   plasma cortisol along with plasma T(4) and that indicate a possible
   interference of these hormones in the absence of adrenaline challenge.
   Similarly, a reduction in plasma T(3) was found after adrenaline
   challenge in propranolol pre-treated fish and that suggests a functional
   synergistic interference of adrenaline with T(3). Adrenaline challenge
   in these fish, however, failed to abolish this propranolol effect. The
   remarkable systemic hypercapnia and acidosis by propranolol
   pre-treatment were reversed by adrenaline challenge, pointing to a
   direct action of adrenaline on acid-base indices probably by a mechanism
   which may not require, beta-adrenergic receptor systems. Interestingly,
   the prominent adrenaline-induced hyperglycemia, hyperlactemia and
   hyperuremea were not altered by propranolol treatment. Similarly,
   adrenaline challenge promoted and propranolol reduced the osmotic
   competencies of the gills, kidneys and liver of this fish as evident in
   the sodium and proton pump activities. The modified physiologic actions
   of adrenaline and its modified interaction with THs and cortisol in
   blocked fish indicate an interaction of adrenaline with cortisol and
   THs. Our physiologic evidences thus support the hypothesis of the
   phenomenon of inter-hormonal interference. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Analgesic effects of the non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
   etidronate and clodronate, independent of anti-resorptive effects on
   bone
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) have greater
   anti-bone-resorptive effects than non-nitrogen-containing
   bisphosphonates (non-NBPs). Hence, NBPs are the current first-choice
   drug for osteoporosis. However, NBPs carry a risk of osteonecrosis of
   jaws. Some animal and human studies suggest that non-NBPs may have
   anti-bone-resorptive effect-independent analgesic effects, but there has
   been no detailed comparison between NBPs and non-NBPs. Here, we compared
   the analgesic effects of several non-NBPs and NBPs, using (a) writhing
   responses induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of 1% acetic
   acid, (b) acetic acid-induced neuronal expression of c-Fos, (c) acetic
   acid-induced elevation of blood corticosterone, and (d)
   hindpaw-licking/biting responses induced by intraplantar injection of
   capsaicin. Among the NBPs and non-NBPs tested, only etidronate and
   clodronate displayed clear analgesic effects, with various routes of
   administration (including the oral one) being effective. However, they
   were ineffective when intraperitoneally injected simultaneously with
   acetic acid. Intracerebroventricular administration of etidronate or
   clodronate, but not of minodronate (an NBP), was also effective. The
   effective doses of etidronate and clodronate were much lower in
   writhing-high-responder strains of mice. Etidronate and clodronate
   reduced acetic acid-induced c-Fos expression in the brain and spinal
   cord, and also the acetic acid-induced corticosterone increase in the
   blood. Etidronate and clodronate each displayed an analgesic effect in
   the capsaicin test. Etidronate and clodronate displayed their analgesic
   effects at doses lower than those inducing anti-bone-resorptive effects.
   These results suggest that etidronate and clodronate exert potent,
   anti-bone-resorptive effect-independent analgesic effects, possibly via
   an interaction with neurons, and that they warrant reappraisal as safe
   drugs for osteoporosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The associations between serum perfluorinated chemicals and thyroid
   function in adolescents and young adults
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) have been widely used in a variety of
   products worldwide for years. However, the effect of PFCs on thyroid
   function has not yet been clearly defined. We recruited 567 subjects
   (aged 12-30 years) in a population-based cohort of adolescents and young
   adults with abnormal urinalysis in the childhood to determine the
   relationship between serum level of PFCs and the levels of serum free
   thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The geometric
   means and geometric standard deviation concentrations of
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS),
   perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) were
   2.67 (2.96) ng/ml, 7.78 (2.42) ng/ml, 1.01 (3.48) ng/ml and 5.81 (2.92)
   ng/ml, respectively. Differences in the levels of free T4 and TSH across
   different categories of PFOA, PFOS and PFUA were insignificant. After
   controlling for confounding factors, multiple linear regression analyses
   revealed mean serum level of free T4 increased significantly across
   categories (<60th, 60-89 and >90th percentiles) of PFNA (P for trend
   =0.012 in the full model). The association between PFNA and free T4 was
   more significant in male subjects in age group 20-30, active smokers and
   in those with higher body mass index in stratified analysis. Serum
   concentrations of PFNA were associated with serum free T4 levels in
   adolescents and young adults. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Nitric oxide rectifies acid-base disturbance and modifies thyroid
   hormone activity during net confinement of air-breathing fish (Anabas
   testudineus Bloch)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Nitric oxide (NO), a short-lived freely diffusible radical gas that acts
   as an important biological signal, regulates an impressive spectrum of
   physiological functions in vertebrates including fishes. The action of
   NO, however, on thyroid hormone status and its role in the integration
   of acid-base, osmotic and metabolic balances during stress are not yet
   delineated in fish. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, was employed
   in the present study to investigate the role of NO in the stressed
   air-breathing fish Anabas testudineus. Short-term SNP treatment (1 mM;
   30 min) interacted negatively with thyroid axis, as evident in the fall
   of plasma thyroxine in both stressed and non-stressed fish. In contrast,
   the cortisol responsiveness to NO was negligible. SNP challenge produced
   systemic alkalosis, hypocapnia and hyperglycemia in non-stressed fish.
   Remarkable acid-base compensation was found in fish kept for 60 min net
   confinement where a rise in blood pH and HCO(3) content occurred with a
   reduction in PCO(2) content. SNP challenge in these fish, on the
   contrary, produced a rise in oxygen load together with hypocapnia but
   without an effect on HCO(3) content, indicating a modulator role of NO
   in respiratory gas transport during stress response. SNP treatment
   reduced Na(+), K(+) ATPase activity in the gill, intestine and liver of
   both stressed and non-stressed fish, and this suggests that stress state
   has little effect on the NO-driven osmotic competence of these organs.
   On the other hand, a modulatory effect of NO was found in the kidney
   which showed a differential response to SNP, emphasizing a key role of
   NO in kidney ion transport and its sensitivity to stressful condition.
   H(+)-ATPase activity, an index of H(+) secretion, downregulated in all
   the organs of both non-stressed and stressed fish except in the gill of
   non-stressed fish and this supports a role for NO in promoting
   alkalosis. The data indicate that, (1) NO interacts antagonistically
   with T(4), (2) modifies respiratory gas transport and (3) integrates
   acid-base and osmotic actions during stress response in air-breathing
   fish. Collectively, this first evidence in fish indicate that NO can
   promote compensatory physiologic modification and that can reduce the
   magnitude of stress-induced acid-base and osmotic disturbance and that
   suggests a role for NO in the ease and ease response of this fish. (C)

TI Gonadal sex differentiation, development up to sexual maturity and

SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Gonadal sex differentiation, development up to sexual maturity and
   steroidogenesis were studied in the Indian skipper frog, Euphlyctis
   cyanophlyctis. In stage 25 tadpoles, gonads contained a few yolk laden
   germ cells and somatic cells. Ovarian differentiation occurred at stage
   27 with the initiation of meiosis. Interestingly, meiosis preceded the
   formation of a central lumen that was discernible at stage 28.
   Folliculogenesis in the developing ovary was observed at stage 29.
   Vitellogenesis was observed in the 3 months old frogs and the females
   attained sexual maturity around 4 months. Testicular differentiation
   occurred indirectly through an ovarian phase. In some animals, from
   stage 37 onwards, oocyte degeneration was observed that was completed
   around metamorphic climax. Concurrently, large numbers of mesonephric
   cells were invading the gonads. Around metamorphosis, reorganization of
   the germ and somatic cells into testicular cords was observed. Following
   metamorphosis, the formation of seminiferous tubules was observed in the
   2 weeks old males. Meiosis in the developing testes was observed in 1.5
   months old males. In 3 months old males, the testes contained all stages
   spermatogenesis including spermatozoa. Steroidogenesis in the developing
   gonads was studied by immunohistochemical localization of 3 beta-HSD
   enzyme. At stage 26, a few immunoreactive cells were seen in the kidneys
   (interrenal cells). However, during and after differentiation, gonads
   failed to show positive immunoreaction. In the developing ovary at stage
   37, follicular cells surrounding the oocytes were positive for 3
   beta-HSD immunoreactivity. In the ovaries of 3 months old females,
   follicular cells surrounding the vitellogenic oocytes and stromal cells
   were positive for 3 beta-HSD immunoreaction. E. cyanophlyctis exhibits
   undifferentiated type of gonadal differentiation, in which gonadal

TI Ibandronate increases the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene FAS by
   epigenetic mechanisms in tumor cells
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB There is growing evidence that aminobisphosphonates like ibandronate
   show anticancer activity by an unknown mechanism. Biochemically, they
   prevent posttranslational isoprenylation of small GTPases, thus
   inhibiting their activity. In tumor cells, activated RAS-GTPase, the
   founding member of the gene family, down-regulates the expression of the
   pro-apoptotic gene FAS via epigenetic DNA-methylation by DNMT1. We
   compared ibandronate treatment in neoplastic human U-2 osteosarcoma and
   in mouse CCL-51 breast cancer cells as well as in the immortalized
   non-neoplastic MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Ibandronate attenuated cell
   proliferation in all cell lines tested. In the neoplastic cells we found
   upregulation of caspases suggesting apoptosis. Further we found
   stimulation of FAS-expression as a result of epigenetic DNA
   demethylation that was due to down-regulation of DNMT1, which was
   rescued by reisoprenylation by both geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and
   farnesylpyrophosphate. In contrast, ibandronate did not affect FAS and
   DNMT1 expression in MC3T3-E1 non-neoplastic cells. Data suggest that
   bisphosphonates via modulation of the activity of small-GTPases induce
   apoptosis in neoplastic cells by DNA-CpG-demethylation and stimulation
   of FAS-expression. In conclusion the shown epigenetic mechanism
   underlying the anti-neoplastic activity of
   farnesyl-transferase-inhibition, also explains the clinical success of
   other drugs, which target this pathway. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Role of the repressor Oaf3p in the recruitment of transcription factors
   and chromatin dynamics during the oleate response
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Cellular responses to environmental stimuli are mediated by the
   co-ordinated activity of multiple control mechanisms, which result in
   the dynamics of cell function. Communication between different levels of
   regulation is central for this adaptability. The present study focuses
   on the interplay between transcriptional regulators and chromatin
   modifiers to co-operatively regulate transcription in response to a
   fatty acid stimulus. The genes involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty
   acids are highly induced in response to fatty acid exposure by four
   gene-specific transcriptional regulators, Oaf (oleate-activated
   transcription factor) 1p, Pip2p (peroxisome induction pathway 2), Oaf3p
   and Adr1p (alcohol dehydrogenase regulator 1). In the present study, we
   examine the interplay of these factors with Htz1p (histone variant
   H2A.Z) in regulating POT1 (peroxisomal oxoacyl thiolase 1) encoding
   peroxisomal thiolase and PIP2 encoding the autoregulatory
   oleate-specific transcriptional activator. Temporal resolution of ChIP
   (chromatin immunoprecipitation) data indicates that Htz1p is required
   for the timely removal of the transcriptional repressor Oaf3p during
   oleate induction. Add p plays an important role in the assembly of
   Htz1p-containing nucleosomes on the POT1 and PIP2 promoters. We also
   investigated the function of the uncharacterized transcriptional
   inhibitor Oaf3p. Deletion of OAF3 led to faster POT1 mRNA accumulation
   than in the wild-type. Most impressively, a highly protected nucleosome
   structure on the POT1 promoter during activation was observed in the
   OAF3 mutant cells in response to oleate induction.

TI iBAG: integrative Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional multiplatform
   genomics data
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Analyzing data from multi-platform genomics experiments
   combined with patients' clinical outcomes helps us understand the
   complex biological processes that characterize a disease, as well as how
   these processes relate to the development of the disease. Current data
   integration approaches are limited in that they do not consider the
   fundamental biological relationships that exist among the data obtained
   from different platforms.
   Statistical Model: We propose an integrative Bayesian analysis of
   genomics data (iBAG) framework for identifying important
   genes/biomarkers that are associated with clinical outcome. This
   framework uses hierarchical modeling to combine the data obtained from
   multiple platforms into one model.
   Results: We assess the performance of our methods using several
   synthetic and real examples. Simulations show our integrative methods to
   have higher power to detect disease-related genes than non-integrative
   methods. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma dataset, we apply
   the iBAG model to integrate gene expression and methylation data to
   study their associations with patient survival. Our proposed method
   discovers multiple methylation-regulated genes that are related to
   patient survival, most of which have important biological functions in
   other diseases but have not been previously studied in glioblastoma.

TI Imparting Regenerative Capacity to Limbs by Progenitor Cell
   Transplantation
SO DEVELOPMENTAL CELL
AB The frog Xenopus can normally regenerate its limbs at early
   developmental stages but loses the ability during metamorphosis. This
   behavior provides a potential gain-of-function model for measures that
   can enhance limb regeneration. Here, we show that frog limbs can be
   caused to form multidigit regenerates after receiving transplants of
   larval limb progenitor cells. It is necessary to activate
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the cells and to add Sonic hedgehog,
   FGF10, and thymosin beta 4. These factors promote survival and growth of
   the grafted cells and also provide pattern information. The eventual
   regenerates are not composed solely of donor tissue; the host cells also
   make a substantial contribution despite their lack of regeneration
   competence. Cells from adult frog legs or from regenerating tadpole
   tails do not promote limb regeneration, demonstrating the necessity for
   limb progenitor cells. These findings have obvious implications for the
   development of a technology to promote limb regeneration in mammals.

TI Chronic treatment with baicalin prevents the chronic mild stress-induced
   depressive-like behavior: Involving the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2
   in rat brain
SO PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Baicalin, a major constituent of flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae
   Radix, has been previously confirmed to decrease the duration of
   immobility in mice exposed to the forced swimming test (FST) and tail
   suspension test (TST). However, its antidepressant effects and
   mechanisms are still seldom studied in chronic mild stress (CMS) model
   of depression. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the
   effects of baicalin on the depressive-like behavior, the mRNA expression
   and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well as prostaglandin E(2)
   (PGE(2)) levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, the
   serum corticosterone levels were also examined. We found that CMS
   procedure not only decreased the sucrose preference and increased serum
   corticosterone levels, but also elevated the activity and mRNA
   expression of COX-2, and increased PGE2 levels in rat brain regions.
   Treatment with baicalin (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) prevented these abnormalities
   induced by CMS. These results confirmed that baicalin exerted
   antidepressant-like effects, and suggested its mechanisms at least
   partially related to decease COX-2 activity and expression, subsequently
   resulted in reduction of PGE(2) levels in brain. Our findings may
   provide a new aspect to understand the antidepressant action of
   baicalin, which is targeted on the COX-2 system in brain. (c) 2012

TI Retrograde Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Shapes a Key Circadian
   Pacemaker Circuit
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB The neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) synchronizes molecular
   oscillations within circadian pacemakers in the Drosophila brain. It is
   expressed in the small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) and large ventral
   lateral neurons, the former being indispensable for maintaining
   behavioral rhythmicity under free-running conditions. How PDF circuits
   develop the specific connectivity traits that endow such global
   behavioral control remains unknown. Here, we show that mature sLNv
   circuits require PDF signaling during early development, acting through
   its cognate receptor PDFR at postsynaptic targets. Yet, axonal defects
   by PDF knockdown are presynaptic and become apparent only after
   metamorphosis, highlighting a delayed response to a signal released
   early on. Presynaptic expression of constitutively active bone
   morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors prevents pdfr mutants misrouting
   phenotype, while sLNv-restricted downregulation of BMP signaling
   components phenocopied pdf(01). Thus, we have uncovered a novel
   mechanism that provides an early "tagging" of synaptic targets that will
   guide circuit refinement later in development.

TI Substrate-Induced Control of Product Formation by Protein Arginine
   Methyltransferase 1
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) aid in the regulation of
   many biological processes. Accurate control of PRMT activity includes
   recognition of specific arginyl groups within targeted proteins and the
   generation of the correct level of methylation, none of which are fully
   understood. The predominant PRMT in vivo, PRMT1, has wide substrate
   specificity and is capable of both mono- and dimethylation, which can
   induce distinct biological outputs. What regulates the specific
   methylation pattern of PRMT1 in vivo is unclear. We report that PRMT1
   methylates a multisite peptide substrate in a nonstochastic manner, with
   less C-terminal preference, consistent with the methylation patterns
   observed in vivo. With a single targeted arginine, PRMT1 catalyzed the
   dimethylation in a semiprocessive manner. The degree of processivity is
   regulated by substrate sequences. Our results identify a novel
   substrate-induced mechanism for modulating PRMT1 product specificity.
   Considering the numerous physiological PRMT1 substrates, as well as the
   distinct biological outputs of mono- and dimethylation products, such
   fine-tuned regulation would significantly contribute to the accurate
   product specificity of PRMT1 in vivo and the proper transmission of
   biochemical information.

TI p53 cooperates with DNA methylation and a suicidal interferon response
   to maintain epigenetic silencing of repeats and noncoding RNAs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Large parts of mammalian genomes are transcriptionally inactive and
   enriched with various classes of interspersed and tandem repeats. Here
   we show that the tumor suppressor protein p53 cooperates with DNA
   methylation to maintain silencing of a large portion of the mouse
   genome. Massive transcription of major classes of short, interspersed
   nuclear elements (SINEs) B1 and B2, both strands of near-centromeric
   satellite DNAs consisting of tandem repeats, and multiple species of
   noncoding RNAs was observed in p53-deficient but not in p53 wild-type
   mouse fibroblasts treated with the DNA demethylating agent
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The abundance of these transcripts exceeded the
   level of beta-actin mRNA by more than 150-fold. Accumulation of these
   transcripts, which are capable of forming double-stranded RNA (dsRNA),
   was accompanied by a strong, endogenous, apoptosis-inducing type I IFN
   response. This phenomenon, which we named "TRAIN" (for "transcription of
   repeats activates interferon"), was observed in spontaneous tumors in
   two models of cancer-prone mice, presumably reflecting naturally
   occurring DNA hypomethylation and p53 inactivation in cancer. These
   observations suggest that p53 and IFN cooperate to prevent accumulation
   of cells with activated repeats and provide a plausible explanation for
   the deregulation of IFN function frequently seen in tumors. Overall,
   this work reveals roles for p53 and IFN that are key for genetic
   stability and therefore relevant to both tumorigenesis and the evolution
   of species.

TI CpG underrepresentation and the bacterial CpG-specific DNA
   methyltransferase M.MpeI
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Cytosine methylation promotes deamination. In eukaryotes, CpG
   methylation is thought to account for CpG underrepresentation. Whether
   scarcity of CpGs in prokaryotic genomes is diagnostic for methylation is
   not clear. Here, we report that Mycoplasms tend to be CpG depleted and
   to harbor a family of constitutively expressed or phase variable
   CpG-specific DNA methyltransferases. The very CpG poor Mycoplasma
   penetrans and its constitutively active CpG-specific methyltransferase
   M.MpeI were chosen for further characterization. Genome-wide sequencing
   of bisulfite-converted DNA indicated that M.MpeI methylated CpG target
   sites both in vivo and in vitro in a locus-nonselective manner. A
   crystal structure of M.MpeI with DNA at 2.15-angstrom resolution showed
   that the substrate base was flipped and that its place in the DNA stack
   was taken by a glutamine residue. A phenylalanine residue was
   intercalated into the "weak" CpG step of the nonsubstrate strand,
   indicating mechanistic similarities in the recognition of the short CpG
   target sequence by prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases.

TI Changes in heat shock protein 70, blood parameters, and fear-related
   behavior in broiler chickens as affected by pleasant and unpleasant
   human contact
SO POULTRY SCIENCE
AB An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of combining both
   pleasant and unpleasant contacts with human beings on physiology and
   behavior of broiler chickens. Birds were subjected to the following
   treatments: (i) received no physical or visual contact with humans
   (control); (ii) from d 1 to 28, chicks were individually stroked gently
   for 30 s once daily (PL); (iii) from d 1 to 28, chicks were picked up
   individually, suspended by both legs, exposed to recorded noise, and
   swung gently for 15 s once daily (UNPL); (iv) from d 1 to 14 and from d
   15 to 28, chicks were subjected to PL and UNPL, respectively (PL-UNPL);
   and (v) from d 1 to 14 and from d 15 to 28, chicks were subjected to
   UNPL and PL, respectively (UNPL-PL). On d 42, birds from each treatment
   group were road-transported for 3 h. Heat shock protein (hsp) 70
   expression, plasma levels of corticosterone, serum creatine kinase
   concentration, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios (HLR), and tonic immobility
   duration were determined pre- and posttransit. There were significant (P
   < 0.05) duration of transportation x human contact treatment
   interactions for HLR and hsp 70 density. Following transit, the PL
   chicks had significantly (P < 0.05) lower HLR and greater hsp 70 density
   than the other groups. The corticosterone of PL and UNPL chicks were
   lower than their control, PL-UNPL, and UNPL-PL counterparts. The PL and
   PL-UNPL treatments were effective in shortening tonic immobility
   duration significantly (P < 0.05). Except for UNPL-PL, the serum
   creatine kinase activity of PL was significantly lower than the other
   groups. In conclusion, subjecting birds to pleasant human contact
   reduced stress and fear reactions to transportation by enhancing the
   ability to express hsp 70 in the brain. Unpleasant human contact had
   adverse effect on the birds' response to transportation. Early age
   pleasant experience with humans failed to negate the adverse effects of
   subsequent unpleasant contact.

TI Allometric Growth in Red Porgy Larvae: Developing Morphological Indices
   for Mesocosm Semi-Intensive Culture
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE
AB We studied the morphological development, allometric growth, and
   cannibalistic behavior of Red Porgy Pagrus pagrus reared in mesocosm
   semi-intensive culture. The study was conducted from hatching to 32 d
   after hatching (DAH). Red porgy ontogeny was characterized by strong
   positive allometric growth of body depth at anus (BDA) to 6.7mm total
   length (TL) at about 2122 DAH. The BDA combined with standard length
   (SL) in a morphometric index was found to be better correlated with dry
   weight than TL and provided an improved method to estimate larval
   growth. Mouth size also exhibited strong positive allometric growth at
   early larval stages that, together with inflation of the swim bladder,
   may have contributed to improve feeding ability, in preparation for the
   high energy demands of metamorphosis. A predictive regression model
   developed for cannibalism underestimated prey size. Cannibalism
   coincided with the development of acidic digestion and was first evident
   at 27 DAH as larvae reached about 23% of their maximum size variation.
   We hypothesize that cannibalism is associated with larval size and
   condition, but is prompted by physiological and energetic factors. The
   bivariate morphometric index developed in this study can be used to
   mitigate cannibalism by controlling larval size variation and improving
   feed supply. The morphological measurements and morphometric indices
   that result from this study provide important tools for improving red
   porgy larvae culture. Received December 13, 2011; accepted July 12, 2012

TI Effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in
   combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of
   hypercholesterolemic rats
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB Probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic
   agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. Accordingly, the present
   study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of
   probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic
   lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. Mixed
   probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each
   of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus
   gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The rats were fed for 8 wk with the
   given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet
   to induce hypercholesterolemia. Results showed that supplementation
   significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein
   cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and
   triglycerides compared with the controls. The symbiotic treatment was
   more effective in lowering LDL-C, whereas mixed probiotics treatment
   more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and LDL-C than the
   phytosterol-containing treatment. The phytosterol-containing treatments
   induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated
   levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free
   triiodothyronine. In conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be
   reduced to lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using
   combinations of Lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in
   functional foods.

TI A hidden Markov model to identify combinatorial epigenetic regulation
   patterns for estrogen receptor alpha target genes
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Many studies have shown that epigenetic changes, such as
   altered DNA methylation and histone modifications, are linked to
   estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha)-positive tumors and disease
   prognoses. Several recent studies have applied high-throughput
   technologies such as ChIP-seq and MBD-seq to interrogate the altered
   architectures of ER alpha regulation in tamoxifen (Tam)-resistant breast
   cancer cells. However, the details of combinatorial epigenetic
   regulation of ER alpha target genes in breast cancers with acquired Tam
   resistance have not yet been fully examined.
   Results: We developed a computational approach to identify and analyze
   epigenetic patterns associated with Tam resistance in the MCF7-T cell
   line as opposed to the Tam-sensitive MCF7 cell line, with the goal of
   understanding the underlying mechanisms of epigenetic regulatory
   influence on resistance to Tam treatment in breast cancer. In this
   study, we used ChIP-seq of ER alpha, RNA polymerase II, three histone
   modifications and MBD-seq data of DNA methylation in MCF7 and MCF7-T
   cells to train hidden Markov models (HMMs). We applied the Bayesian
   information criterion to determine that a 20-state HMM was best, which
   was reduced to a 14-state HMM with a Bayesian information criterion
   score of 1.21291 x 10(7). We further identified four classes of
   biologically meaningful states in this breast cancer cell model system,
   and a set of ER alpha combinatorial epigenetic regulated target genes.
   The correlated gene expression level and gene ontology analyses showed
   that different gene ontology terms were enriched with Tam-resistant
   versus sensitive breast cancer cells. Our study illustrates the
   applicability of HMM-based analysis of genome-wide high-throughput
   genomic data to study epigenetic influences on E2/ER alpha regulation in
   breast cancer.

TI Glucocorticoid sensitizers Bag1 and Ppid are regulated by adolescent
   stress in a sex-dependent manner
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Early life stress precipitates dysregulation of the hypothalamic
   pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and this effect is most pronounced in
   females. The mechanisms that mediate female sensitivity to
   stress-induced HPA axis dysregulation are unknown. The purpose of this
   study was to determine whether sex moderates the effects of chronic
   adolescent stress on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) translocation and
   moderators of the GR system. Female adolescent rats with a history of
   chronic stress exposure demonstrated a delayed resolution of the plasma
   corticosterone response to an acute stressor and this delay was
   accompanied by attenuated GR translocation compared to control
   adolescent females. The chronic stress-induced phenotype in females was
   similar to the baseline phenotype in male adolescent rats. Conversely,
   the expression patterns of GR moderators/co-chaperones became more
   sexually dimorphic following chronic stress, suggesting divergent
   function of the GR system between male and female adolescent rats. Gene
   expression of Ppid, a positive regulator of the GR, was predicted by
   plasma estradiol and 34% lower in control adolescent females than males,
   indicating that sex steroids may play a role in the sexually dimorphic
   response. After chronic adolescent stress, females displayed elevated
   hippocampal expression of Bag1 and Ppid genes that was not observed in
   males. Overall, the GR output to an acute stressor, illustrated by
   transcription of Nr3c1 (encoding the GR), Bag1, Fkbp5, Ppid, and Src1,
   was significantly upregulated and differed in a sex-specific and chronic
   stress-dependent manner. This study provides new evidence for sex
   differences during development and adaptation of the glucocorticoid
   receptor chaperone system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Epigenetic Silencing of Antiviral Genes Renders Clones of Huh-7 Cells
   Permissive for Hepatitis C Virus Replication
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) does not replicate efficiently in wild-type
   human hepatoma Huh-7 cells, but it replicates robustly in certain
   subclones of Huh-7 cells. Previously, we demonstrated that silencing of
   cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1), a
   cellular transcription factor that inhibits HCV replication, allows HCV
   to replicate in HRP1 cells, a subclone of Huh-7 cells permissive for HCV
   replication. Here we show that silencing of myxovirus resistant 1 (MX1),
   a known interferon-induced antiviral gene, is responsible for HRP4
   cells, another subclone of Huh-7 cells, being permissive for HCV
   replication. Both CREB3L1 and MX1 are epigenetically silenced through
   DNA methylation in HRP1 and HRP4 cells, respectively. We further
   demonstrate that Huh-7 cells exist as a mixed population of cells with
   distinct patterns of gene methylation and HCV replicates in
   subpopulations of Huh-7 cells that have antiviral genes epigenetically
   silenced by DNA hypermethylation. Our results demonstrate that
   understanding the mechanism through which subclones of Huh-7 cells
   become permissive for HCV replication is crucial for studying their
   interaction with HCV.

TI The Forkhead Transcription Factor FOXM1 Controls Cell Cycle-Dependent
   Gene Expression through an Atypical Chromatin Binding Mechanism
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB There are nearly 50 forkhead (FOX) transcription factors encoded in the
   human genome and, due to sharing a common DNA binding domain, they are
   all thought to bind to similar DNA sequences. It is therefore unclear
   how these transcription factors are targeted to specific chromatin
   regions to elicit specific biological effects. Here, we used chromatin
   immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate the
   genome-wide chromatin binding mechanisms used by the forkhead
   transcription factor FOXM1. In keeping with its previous association
   with cell cycle control, we demonstrate that FOXM1 binds and regulates a
   group of genes which are mainly involved in controlling late cell cycle
   events in the G(2) and M phases. However, rather than being recruited
   through canonical RYAAAYA forkhead binding motifs, FOXM1 binding is
   directed via CHR (cell cycle genes homology region) elements. FOXM1
   binds these elements through protein-protein interactions with the MMB
   transcriptional activator complex. Thus, we have uncovered a novel and
   unexpected mode of chromatin binding of a FOX transcription factor that
   allows it to specifically control cell cycle-dependent gene expression.

TI Thyroid ala cartilage graft laryngotracheoplasty for closure of large

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
AB We describe a novel technique for closure of a large, persistent,
   pediatric tracheocutaneous fistula using a thyroid ala cartilage graft.
   Case report and review of the literature. We report 2 cases of large (>4
   mm), pediatric tracheocutaneous fistulas, in which primary closure of
   the tracheal defect would have caused critical airway narrowing and were
   managed with an anterior laryngotracheal reconstruction with a thyroid
   ala cartilage graft and closure of the tracheocutaneous fistula. The
   patients were extubated immediately postoperatively and maintained
   successfully closed fistulas with no clinically significant airway
   compromise. One of the considerations in pediatric tracheocutaneous
   fistula closure is to assess how the airway luminal diameter will be
   affected by primary closure of the tracheal defect. If primary closure
   of the tracheal opening causes critical airway narrowing because of a
   large tracheocutaneous fistula, a thyroid ala cartilage graft may be
   used for laryngotracheoplasty and allow for primary closure with a
   layered closure of the overlying strap muscles and soft tissue. (C) 2012

   for the thyroid tumor. RET gene analysis was performed in both the index
   patient and his family. There were no V804M RET mutation and abnormal
   laboratory findings within his family except the index patient.
   Therefore, this patient was a de novo V804M RET germline mutation.

TI Function, diversity, and application of insect juvenile hormone
   epoxidases (CYP15)
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Juvenile hormones (JHs) represent a family of sesquiterpenoid hormones
   in insects, and they play a key role in regulating development,
   metamorphosis, and reproduction. The last two steps of the JH
   biosynthetic pathway, epoxidation and methyl esterification of farnesoic
   acid to JH, are insect specific, and thus have long been considered a
   promising target for biorational insecticides. Recently, the enzymes
   involved in the last two steps have been molecularly identified: JH acid
   methyltransferase catalyzes the esterification step and the cytochrome
   P450 CYP15 enzyme catalyzes the epoxidation step. In this review, we
   describe the recent progress on the characterization of JH biosynthetic
   enzymes, with special focus on the function and diversity of the CYP15
   family. CYP15 genes have evolved lineage-specific substrate specificity
   and regulatory mechanisms in insects, which appear to be associated with
   the lineage-specific acquisition of unique JH structure and function. In
   addition, the lack of CYP15 genes in crustacean (Daphnia pulex) and
   arachnid (Tetranychus urticae) species, whose genomes have been fully
   sequenced, may imply that CYP15 enzymes are an evolutionary innovation
   in insects to use the epoxide forms of methylated farnesoid molecules as
   their principal JHs. Molecular identification and characterization of
   CYP15 genes from broad taxa of insects have paved the way to the design
   of target-specific, biorational anti-JH agents.

TI Internal Morphological Analysis for Age Estimation of Blow Fly Pupae
   (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Postmortem Interval Estimation
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES
AB Larvae and pupae of blow fly species are frequently used in postmortem
   interval estimation, their age indicating minimum time since death. Most
   studies have considered age estimation of larvae, neglecting study of
   pupae. Relative development of external pupal features is useful, but
   there are also internal changes during metamorphosis that may be
   indicators of age, utilizing histological techniques. This study aimed
   to optimize preservation and histological analysis of blow fly pupae,
   specifically Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Lucilia sericata
   (Meigen), and to examine internal features with potential for age
   estimation. Effect of hot-water-killing and different preservatives were
   examined. It was determined that blow fly pupae should be pierced
   through the three tagma, hot-water-killed, and preserved in 80% ethanol
   as the optimal preservation for subsequent analyses. Hematoxylin and
   eosin stained pupal sections revealed differences in brain and thoracic
   muscle development throughout the pupal stage with potential for age
   estimation.

TI The Effect of Acute Stress and Long-Term Corticosteroid Administration
   on Plasma Metabolites in an Urban and Desert Songbird
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY
AB In response to stressful stimuli, animals activate the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can result in transition to
   the "emergency life history stage." A key adaptive characteristic of
   this life history stage is the mobilization of energy stores. However,
   few data are available on the metabolic response to acute stress in
   wild-caught, free-ranging birds. We quantified the effect of acute
   capture and restraint stress on plasma glucose, free fatty acid, and
   uric acid in free-ranging Abert's towhees Melozone aberti. Furthermore,
   birds were caught from urban and desert localities of Phoenix, Arizona,
   to investigate potential effects of urban versus desert habitats on the
   corticosterone (CORT) and metabolic response to acute stress.
   Complementing work on free-ranging birds, captive towhees received
   CORT-filled Silastic capsules to investigate the response of urban and
   desert conspecifics to long-term CORT administration. We quantified the
   effect of CORT administration on baseline plasma glucose and uric acid,
   liver and pectoralis muscle glycogen stores, kidney phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxykinase (PEPCK-C, a key gluconeogenic enzyme), and body mass.
   Acute stress increased plasma CORT and glucose and decreased plasma uric
   acid but had no effect on plasma free fatty acid. There was no
   difference between urban and desert localities in body mass, fat scores,
   and the response to acute stress. CORT administration decreased body
   mass but had no effect on glucose and uric acid, pectoral muscle
   glycogen, or kidney PEPCK-C. However, liver glycogen of CORT-treated
   urban birds increased compared with corresponding controls, whereas
   glycogen decreased in CORT-treated desert birds. This study suggests
   that Abert's towhees principally mobilize glucose during acute stress
   but urban and desert towhees do not differ in their CORT and metabolic
   response to acute stress or long-term CORT administration.

TI Epigenetic Studies of Schizophrenia: Progress, Predicaments, and
   Promises for the Future
SO SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB Increased understanding about the functional complexity of the genome
   has led to growing recognition about the role of epigenetic variation in
   the etiology of schizophrenia. Epigenetic processes act to dynamically
   control gene expression independently of DNA sequence variation and are
   known to regulate key neurobiological and cognitive processes in the
   brain. To date, our knowledge about the role of epigenetic processes in
   schizophrenia is limited and based on analyses of small numbers of
   samples obtained from a range of different cell and tissue types. Moving
   forward, it will be important to establish cause and effect in
   epigenetic studies of schizophrenia and broaden our horizons beyond DNA
   methylation. Rather than investigating genetic and epigenetic factors
   independently, an integrative etiological research paradigm based on the
   combination of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic analyses is
   required.

TI Crenarchaeal chromatin proteins Cren7 and Sul7 compact DNA by inducing
   rigid bends
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Archaeal chromatin proteins share molecular and functional similarities
   with both bacterial and eukaryotic chromatin proteins. These proteins
   play an important role in functionally organizing the genomic DNA into a
   compact nucleoid. Cren7 and Sul7 are two crenarchaeal
   nucleoid-associated proteins, which are structurally homologous, but not
   conserved at the sequence level. Co-crystal structures have shown that
   these two proteins induce a sharp bend on binding to DNA. In this study,
   we have investigated the architectural properties of these proteins
   using atomic force microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and
   magnetic tweezers. We demonstrate that Cren7 and Sul7 both compact DNA
   molecules to a similar extent. Using a theoretical model, we quantify
   the number of individual proteins bound to the DNA as a function of
   protein concentration and show that forces up to 3.5 pN do not affect
   this binding. Moreover, we investigate the flexibility of the bending
   angle induced by Cren7 and Sul7 and show that the protein-DNA complexes
   differ in flexibility from analogous bacterial and eukaryotic
   DNA-bending proteins.

TI Demethylation of Epiregulin Gene by Histone Demethylase FBXL11 and BCL6
   Corepressor Inhibits Osteo/dentinogenic Differentiation
SO STEM CELLS
AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a reliable resource for tissue
   regeneration, but the molecular mechanism underlying directed
   differentiation remains unclear; this has restricted potential MSC
   applications. Histone methylation, controlled by histone
   methyltransferases and demethylases, may play a key role in MSC
   differentiation. Here, we investigated FBXL11, a histone demethylase,
   lysine (K)-specific demethylase 2A, which is evolutionarily conserved,
   ubiquitously expressed, and a member of the JmjC-domain-containing
   histone demethylase family. We tested whether FBXL11 could inhibit the
   osteo/dentinogenic differentiation potential in MSC cells with gain-and
   loss-of-function assays. We found that FBXL11 regulated
   osteo/dentinogenic differentiation in MSC cells. Furthermore, we found
   that the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor, Epiregulin (EREG),
   was a downstream target of FBXL11, and that EREG mediated FBXL11
   regulation of MSC differentiation. Moreover, we found that the FBXL11
   histone demethylase function was activated by associating with BCL6
   corepressor, and this complex could repress EREG transcription by
   increasing histone K4/36 methylation in the EREG promoter. In
   conclusion, our results elucidated a new function for FBXL11 and EREG,
   explored the molecular mechanism underlying directed differentiation in
   MSC cells, and identified potential target genes for improving tissue
   regeneration techniques. STEM CELLS 2013;31:126-136

TI Larval myogenesis in Echinodermata: conserved features and morphological

   and Holothuroidea
SO EVOLUTION & DEVELOPMENT
AB The myogenesis of class-specific larval forms of three classes belonging
   to the phylum Echinodermata (Echinoidae, Asteroidea, and Holothuroidea)
   was investigated via gross-anatomy and comparative morphology of larval
   muscles. Using staining with phalloidin and antibodies against the
   muscle proteins, with subsequent CLSM and 3D imaging, we have examined
   myogenesis in the larvae from the gastrula stage to pre-metamorphosis
   larval stages. We have shown that temporal and spatial expression of
   muscle proteins is similar in echinoidea and asteroidea larvae but
   differs in holothuroidea larvae at early developmental stages. New
   insights regarding the protein composition of maturing muscular fibrils
   during development in echinoderm larvae were detected. The first
   differentiating muscle structures in all tested classes have been found
   to be circular esophageal muscles that are associated with larval
   feeding. During early differentiation of echinoderm larval muscle cells,
   we observed that the expression patterns of the muscle proteins were not
   uniform but with a characteristic diffuse distribution, which is typical
   for smooth muscle. An unusual pattern of expression of the muscle
   proteins was detected in larval sphincters: the thick muscle proteins
   were first expressed during the early developmental stages, whereas
   F-actin appeared at later stages. In addition, paired star-shaped
   muscles were revealed in the mature Echinoidae plutei, but were absent
   in the Asteroidea, and Holothuroidea larvae. All tested species of
   Echinodermata exhibited both conserved features of muscle morphology
   during development indicating a common life history strategy and a
   planktonic habitat, and also an extensive morphological diversity
   representing specific anatomical adaptations during development.

TI Characterization of Highper, an ENU-induced mouse mutant with abnormal
   psychostimulant and stress responses
SO PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Chemical mutagenesis in the mouse is a forward genetics approach that
   introduces random mutations into the genome, thereby providing an
   opportunity to annotate gene function and characterize phenotypes that
   have not been previously linked to a given gene.
   We report on the behavioral characterization of Highper, an
   N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutant mouse line.
   Highper and B6 control mice were assessed for locomotor activity in the
   open field and home cage environments. Basal and acute restraint
   stress-induced corticosterone levels were measured. Mice were tested for
   locomotor response to cocaine (5, 20, 30, and 45 mg/kg), methylphenidate
   (30 mg/kg), and ethanol (0.75, 1.25, and 1.75 g/kg). The rewarding and
   reinforcing effects of cocaine were assessed using conditioned place
   preference and self-administration paradigms.
   Highper mice are hyperactive during behavioral tests but show normal
   home cage locomotor behavior. Highper mice also exhibit a twofold
   increase in locomotor response to cocaine, methylphenidate, and ethanol
   and prolonged activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in
   response to acute stress. Highper mice are more sensitive to the
   rewarding and reinforcing effects of cocaine, although place preference
   in Highper mice appears to be significantly influenced by the
   environment in which the drug is administered.
   Altogether, our findings indicate that Highper mice may provide
   important insights into the genetic, molecular, and biological
   mechanisms underlying stress and the drug reward pathway.

TI Ras-dva Is a Novel Pit-1- and Glucocorticoid-Regulated Gene in the
   Embryonic Anterior Pituitary Gland
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoids play a role in functional differentiation of pituitary
   somatotrophs and lactotrophs during embryogenesis. Ras-dva was
   identified as a gene regulated by anterior neural fold
   protein-1/homeobox expressed in embryonic stem cells-1, a transcription
   factor known to be critical in pituitary development, and has an
   expression profile in the chicken embryonic pituitary gland that is
   consistent with in vivo regulation by glucocorticoids. The objective of
   this study was to characterize expression and regulation of ras-dva mRNA
   in the developing chicken anterior pituitary. Pituitary ras-dva mRNA
   levels increased during embryogenesis to a maximum on embryonic day (e)
   18 and then decreased and remained low or undetectable after hatch.
   Ras-dva expression was highly enriched in the pituitary gland on e18
   relative to other tissues examined. Glucocorticoid treatment of
   pituitary cells from mid- and late-stage embryos rapidly increased
   ras-dva mRNA, suggesting it may be a direct transcriptional target of
   glucocorticoids. A reporter construct driven by 4 kb of the chicken
   ras-dva 5'-flanking region, containing six putative pituitary-specific
   transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) binding sites and two potential
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites, was highly activated in
   embryonic pituitary cells and up-regulated by corticosterone.
   Mutagenesis of the most proximal Pit-1 site decreased promoter activity
   in chicken e11 pituitary cells, indicating regulation of ras-dva by
   Pit-1. However, mutating putative GR binding sites did not substantially
   reduce induction of ras-dva promoter activity by corticosterone,
   suggesting additional DNA elements within the 5'-flanking region are
   responsible for glucocorticoid regulation. We have identified ras-dva as
   a glucocorticoid-regulated gene that is likely expressed in cells of the
   Pit-1 lineage within the developing anterior pituitary gland.

SO EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
AB We report our prospective experience of short-stay hospitalisation for
   benign thyroid surgery. Post-operative outcome, complication rate and
   duration of hospitalisation were evaluated for 200 similar patients with
   bilateral multi-nodular goitres treated surgically by total
   thyroidectomy. All subjects gave written informed consent. A short-stay
   regimen, with discharge within 24 h of admission, was possible in 92.5
   %. Fourteen (7 %) were discharged on the second post-operative day and
   one on the fourth post-operative day. Causes of the 15 delayed
   discharges beyond 24 h were 11 hypocalcaemia (5.5 %), 3 heamatoma (1.5
   %) and 1 dysphonia (0.5 %). All compressive haematomata were treated by
   urgent reoperation. No mortality occurred. None required tracheostomies.
   Transient complications were diagnosed in 36 cases: 25 with
   hypocalcaemia and 11 with recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries. Permanent
   complications were observed in three patients: two with
   hypoparathyroidism and one with nerve damage. All patients were
   carefully counselled about potential thyroid surgery complications and a

TI Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and RET proto-oncogene: Mutation
   spectrum in the familial cases and a meta-analysis of studies on the
   sporadic form
SO MUTATION RESEARCH-REVIEWS IN MUTATION RESEARCH
AB Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an uncommon malignant tumor arising
   from the calcitonin-producing parafollicular cells (C cells) of thyroid.
   It accounts for 5-10% of all thyroid cancers, and it mostly occurs as a
   sporadic entity (sMTC), but a familial pattern (fMTC) is also possible.
   RET protooncogene germline mutations are crucial for the onset and the
   progression of fMTC, and the occurrence of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms could predispose to the sporadic form. In order to clarify
   the role of this gene in MTC, we carefully reviewed the PubMed database
   using appropriate terms. First, we summarized current knowledge of the
   germline RET mutations, mutation spectrum, and prevalence. We then
   performed a meta-analysis on the available case-control association
   studies for sMTC. Finally, we carried out in silico predictions of the
   best associated variants in the attempt to better define their role in
   the disease. To date, a total of 39 different RET germline mutations
   have been identified in fMTC families. The most affected codons are 609,
   611, 618, 620 (exon 10) and 634 (exon 11), encoding for the
   extracellular cysteine-rich domain, and codons 768 (exon 13) and 804
   (exon 14) of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Six polymorphisms
   with at least three studies were included in the meta-analysis (A45A
   [rs1800858], G691S [rs1799939], L769L [rs1800861 I, S836S [rs1800862],
   S904S [rs1800863], and IVS1-126G>T [rs2565206]). The meta-analysis
   demonstrated a modest association of sMTC susceptibility with S836S and
   a strong association with the IVS1-126G>T polymorphism. Besides RET
   polymorphisms, we also investigated the role of a few other
   low-penetrance alleles of genes involved in the RET pathway or in
   xenobiotic metabolism, but none of these were confirmed. Thus, despite
   the well-known molecular basis of fMTC, the genetic variants of the
   sporadic form are still poorly understood, and functional analyses are
   needed to better understand the consequence of such RET variants and to
   improve our knowledge on the disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI A heartfelt response: new thyroid hormone-sensitive neurons in the

   differential effects on cells depending on the receptor isoform that
   they express. In this issue of the JCI, Mittag et al. provide evidence
   that thyroid hormone receptors are essential for the formation of a
   population of parvalbuminergic neurons in the anterior hypothalamus,
   linking, for the first time, impaired thyroid hormone signaling during
   development to cellular deficits in the hypothalamus. Since this newly

TI BRCA1 Immunohistochemistry in a Molecularly Characterized Cohort of
   Ovarian High-Grade Serous Carcinomas
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
AB BRCA1 and BRCA2 dysfunction, frequently seen in high-grade serous
   ovarian carcinomas, often results from germline mutations, somatic
   mutations, and promoter methylation. Identification of tumors with BRCA
   defects has therapeutic and prognostic implications. Identifying
   germline BRCA mutations is also important given the increased risk for
   hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma. Our goal was to assess whether
   immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) for BRCA1 is an effective method for
   the detection of BRCA1 dysfunction in molecularly characterized
   high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma. We identified 43 high-grade ovarian
   serous carcinomas with known events in BRCA1 and BRCA2 included in The
   Cancer Genome Atlas Project. BRCA1 stain was first assessed without
   knowledge of the BRCA status, and a semiquantitative assessment for
   intensity and amount of staining was performed. The stains were
   reevaluated and divided into 3 categories (retained, loss, and
   equivocal) on the basis of correlation with genotyping data. Presence of
   retained BRCA staining was considered normal, whereas the other
   patterns, including equivocal staining or loss of staining, were
   considered abnormal. Two pathologists, blinded to the BRCA status, then
   scored 2 sets of validation cases selected on the basis of available
   molecular data-1 with only germline mutation status available (n = 31)
   and 1 with comprehensive genomic data (n = 39). The pathologists agreed
   88% of the time in the training set and 91% in the validation sets. In
   the training set, abnormal BRCA staining was seen in 24 cases, of which
   21 (87%) showed BRCA1 genetic abnormalities, 1 showed BRCA2 mutations,
   and 2 showed no BRCA abnormalities. Abnormal BRCA1 staining was noted in
   all 5 cases with BRCA1 germline mutations, in 3 (60%) of 5 with BRCA1
   somatic mutations, and in 13 (93%) of 14 with BRCA1 promoter
   methylation. The 2 validation sets included 70 additional patients, and
   all cases with germline BRCA1 mutations (n = 11) showed abnormal BRCA1
   staining. Tumors with BRCA1 promoter methylation also showed abnormal
   staining in 6 (86%) of 7 cases. In the entire study, no cases with BRCA1
   germline mutation showed intact immunostaining (negative predictive
   value = 100%). This study shows that BRCA1 IHC is well correlated with
   molecular events in ovarian carcinoma. Considering the high negative
   predictive value for germline mutations, BRCA1 IHC appears to be an
   effective approach to stratify patients for germline genetic testing and
   to detect other mechanisms of BRCA1 dysfunction in high-grade serous
   ovarian carcinomas.

TI Epigenetic Modulation by Methionine Deficiency Attenuates the Potential
   for Gastric Cancer Cell Dissemination
SO JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY
AB Methionine dependency occurs frequently in tumor cells. Here we have
   investigated the effect of methionine deficiency on metastatic potential
   of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
   Model of peritoneal carcinomatosis and xenograft was generated by
   intraperitoneal or subcutaneous implantation of gastric cancer cells in
   NOD-SCID mice. In comparison to control medium, 3-day culture of MKN45,
   MKN74, and KATOIII cells in a methionine-deficient medium inhibited cell
   proliferation, increased the rate of cell apoptosis, and reduced cell
   adhesion and migration. In the xenograft model induced by implantation
   of MNK45 and MNK74 cells, two cycles of methionine-deficient diet
   reduced the tumor growth. Further on, a 10-day cycle of
   methionine-deficient diet reduced the number of peritoneal nodules in
   the model of peritoneal carcinomatosis induced by MKN45 cells injection.
   Finally, a microarray analysis of the methylation of promoter CpG islets
   demonstrated that methionine deficiency reduced the promoter methylation
   of E-cadherin whose expression was markedly increased in vivo and in
   vitro.
   In summary, we have provided evidence that a methionine-deficient diet
   modulates the growth of gastric tumor cells and in vitro deficiency of
   methionine increased apoptosis and decreased cellular adhesion and
   migration associated to epigenetic change of E-cadherin gene, in vivo
   and in vitro.

TI Carbonate Mineral Saturation State as the Recruitment Cue for Settling
   Bivalves in Marine Muds
SO ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB After a pelagic larval phase, infaunal bivalves undergo metamorphosis
   and transition to the underlying sediments to begin the benthic stage of
   their life history, where they explore and then either accept or reject
   sediments. Although the settlement cues used by juvenile infaunal
   bivalves are poorly understood, here we provide evidence that carbonate
   saturation state is a significant chemical cue in both direct
   observation laboratory studies and field manipulations. In the
   laboratory, plantigrade-stage Mercenaria mercenaria (200 mu m shell
   height) showed a significant positive relationship between percent
   burrowed and a"broken vertical bar(aragonite), with an increasing
   probability of settlement with increasing saturation state. In the
   field, we increased bivalve recruitment by a factor of three in a 30-day
   field study by raising the pH (similar to 0.3) and saturation state of
   surface sediments by buffering sediments with crushed shell (CaCO(3)).
   The susceptibility of infaunal bivalves to dissolution mortality and the
   tight coupling of other sedimentary biogeochemical processes with
   carbonate dynamics suggest that mineral thermodynamics may be an
   overarching cue new settlers are responding to.

TI Positive Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody Titer Is Associated with Dysphoric
   Moods during Pregnancy and Postpartum
SO JOGNN-JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGIC AND NEONATAL NURSING
AB Objective To examine general dysphoric moods prospectively in women who
   tested positive for thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO) during
   pregnancy and postpartum. Design Longitudinal, correlational, two-group,
   observational study. Setting Perinatal clinics. Participants Six-hundred
   thirty-one (631) pregnant women. Methods Participants were screened for
   TPO antibodies, and 63 were TPO euthyroid positive. All were asked to
   continue into a 6-month postpartum follow-up and 47 agreed. A comparison
   group of TPO negative women (n = 72) was randomly selected for
   follow-up. Women were visited monthly for 6 months and a blood sample
   was obtained to measure thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), a targeted
   physical exam was conducted, and a thyroid symptom checklist (Perceived
   Stress Scale) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) checklist were
   completed. Results Pregnant TPO-positive women had significantly higher
   depressive symptoms and were more likely to score higher than 20 on the
   POMS depression (POMS-D) scale than TPO-negative women. The TPO-positive
   women had significantly higher depression, anger, and total mood
   disturbance scores postpartum than TPO-negative women, regardless of
   development of postpartum thyroiditis (n = 25). Conclusions Our results
   suggest that the presence of TPO autoantibodies alone in euthyroid
   pregnant and postpartum women increases the possibility of negative
   dysphoric moods, especially depressive symptoms that cannot be explained
   by stress or demographic factors. JOGNN, 42, E26-E32; 2013. DOI:

TI Replication of an experiment on extremely diluted thyroxine and highland
   amphibians
SO HOMEOPATHY
AB Introduction: The purpose of this study was to reproduce an experiment
   with diluted thyroxine and amphibians. A detailed account of the
   difficulties of this line of research has been published by the initial
   team (Endler and Scherer-Pongratz). One experiment which has been
   reported reproducible by the initial team and independent researchers is
   the effect of extremely diluted agitated thyroxine (T30x) versus
   analogously prepared water (W30x) in amphibians from biotopes above the
   tree line (highland amphibians).
   Methods: (A) The author replicated the experiment. Rana temporaria were
   taken from an alpine biotope and the methods given in the original
   protocols were followed. Animals were treated from the 2-legged stage
   on. (B), the author reanalyzed the results reported by the initial team
   and by independent researchers (van Wijk, Lassnig, Zausner-Lukitsch,
   Bach, Harrer).
   Results: (A) In the author's own experiment, there was a clear trend of
   T30x animals developing more slowly (i.e. up to 6 h within 3 days) than
   W30x animals. This is in line with the previous experiments. Due to
   small numbers of animals, the differences in the frequency of larvae
   reaching the 4-legged stage and the stage with reduced tail were not
   statistically significant (p > 0.05). The effect size was large (d >
   0.08). (B) In the analysis of all available data with regard to the
   4-legged stage, pooled T30x values from the initial team were 10.1%
   smaller than W30x values (100%) and pooled T30x values from the 5
   independent researchers were 12.4% smaller (p < 0.01 and d > 0.08).
   Analogously, the number of animals entering the juvenile stage with
   reduced tail was smaller for T30x than for W30x. Homeopathy (2013) 102,

TI Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in thyroid surgery: a review
SO ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) is an important and potentially
   catastrophic complication of thyroid surgery. Permanent RLNP occurs in
   0.33% of cases, with transient palsies in 58%. A literature review and
   analysis of recent data regarding RLNP in thyroid surgery was performed,
   with particular focus on the identification of high-risk patients, the
   role of intraoperative identification and dissection of the nerve, and
   the role of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) and optimal
   perioperative nerve assessment. In conjunction with the review, data
   from the Monash University/Alfred Hospital Endocrine Surgery Unit
   between January 2007 and October 2011 were retrospectively analysed,
   including 3736 consecutive nerves at risk (NAR). The current literature
   and our data confirm that patients undergoing re-operative thyroid
   surgery and thyroid surgery for malignancies are at increased risk of
   RLNP. Intraoperative visualization and capsular dissection of the RLN
   remain the gold standard for intraoperative care during thyroid surgery
   for reducing RLNP risk. IONM should not be used as the sole mechanism
   for identifying and preserving the nerve, although it can be used to aid
   in the identification and dissection of the nerve, and may aid in nerve
   protection in high-risk cases including cancer surgery and re-operative
   surgery.

TI DNA methylation profiling in breast cancer discordant identical twins
   identifies DOK7 as novel epigenetic biomarker
SO CARCINOGENESIS
AB Using whole blood from 15 twin pairs discordant for breast cancer and
   high-resolution (450K) DNA methylation analysis, we identified 403
   differentially methylated CpG sites including known and novel potential
   breast cancer genes. Confirming the results in an independent validation
   cohort of 21 twin pairs determined the docking protein DOK7 as a
   candidate for blood-based cancer diagnosis. DNA hypermethylation of the
   promoter region was also seen in primary breast cancer tissues and
   cancer cell lines. Hypermethylation of DOK7 occurs years before tumor
   diagnosis, suggesting a role as a powerful epigenetic blood-based
   biomarker as well as providing insights into breast cancer pathogenesis.

TI Generalized disruption of inherited genomic imprints leads to
   wide-ranging placental defects and dysregulated fetal growth
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Monoallelic expression of imprinted genes, including ones solely
   expressed in the placenta, is essential for normal placental development
   and fetal growth. To better understand the role of placental imprinting
   in placental development and fetal growth, we examined conceptuses
   developing in the absence of maternally derived DNA
   (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1o (DNMT1o). Absence of DNMT1o results
   in the partial loss of methylation at imprinted differentially
   methylated domain (DMD) sequences in the embryo and the placenta.
   Mid-gestation E9.5 DNMT1o-deficient placentas exhibited structural
   abnormalities of all tissue layers. At E17.5, all examined placentas had
   aberrant placental morphology, most notably in the spongiotrophoblast
   and labyrinth layers. Abnormalities included an expanded volume fraction
   of spongiotrophoblast tissue with extension of the spongiotrophoblast
   layer into the labyrinth. Many mutant placentas also demonstrated
   migration abnormalities of glycogen cells. Additionally, the volume
   fraction of the labyrinth was reduced, as was the surface area for
   maternal fetal gas exchange. Despite these placental morphologic
   abnormalities, approximately one-half of DNMT1o-deficient fetuses
   survived to late gestation (E17.5). Furthermore, DNMT1o-deficient
   placentas supported a broad range of fetal growth. The ability of some
   DNMT1o-deficient and morphologically abnormal placentas to support fetal
   growth in excess of wild type demonstrates the importance of
   differential methylation of DMDs and proper imprinting of discrete gene
   clusters to placental morphogenesis and fetal growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Folate and Alzheimer: when time matters
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB Folate is necessary for DNA and mtDNA integrity and via
   folate/B12-dependent methionine cycle for methylation of multiple
   substrates (epigenetic DNA and enzymes) and methylation of homocysteine.
   During embryogenesis, folate deficiency is a risk factor for neural tube
   defects and late in life for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's dementia
   (AD). It induces several Alzheimer pathomechanisms like oxidative
   stress, Ca(++) influx, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and
   beta-amyloid. But impact of folic acid supplementation on prevention or
   delay of dementia is a matter of debate. Six out of seven randomized
   controlled trials (RCT) with B vitamin intervention periods between 2
   and 5.4 years reported about cognitive benefits in the supplemented
   groups mainly for those subjects with high homocysteine or low folate
   levels at baseline. This review tries to demonstrate the connection
   between folate deficiency and AD, analyses selected epidemiologic
   studies and RCT on folate/B12/homocysteine with long-observation periods
   (>= 2 years RCT; >= 4 years observational) and attempts to find
   explanations for the controversy in literature like short follow-up,
   heterogeneity of subjects concerning age, recruitment, baseline
   cognition, inclusion criteria and probably "misleading"(not
   representative for the past) folate/B12/homocysteine levels due to not
   reported short-term use of multivitamins or food-fortification.
   Population-based studies-epidemiologic and interventional-starting in
   the fourth decade would provide the best information about the impact of
   folate on later development of AD. Mandatory folate fortification areas
   will be important future field studies for-like neural tube
   defects-hopefully declining AD incidence and disproving safety concerns.

TI Increases in systemic and local stress: a probable mechanism of visceral
   fat accumulation and insulin resistance in adult catch-up growth rats?
SO EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Catch-up growth in adult (CUGA) is increasingly proposed as an important
   causative factor for the widespread insulin resistance (IR)-related
   diseases especially in developing countries/territories. We aimed to
   investigate the effects of CUGA to insulin sensitivity, lipid profile
   and stress in rats, as well as the probable relationship among them.
   Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups for two
   sampling points: caloric restriction group (R4) and normal chow controls
   for four weeks (NC4); CUGA re-fed with normal chow (RN4), CUGA re-fed
   with high-fat diet (RH4), normal chow controls (NC8) and high-fat diet
   controls (HF8) for eight weeks. Visceral fat accumulation (visceral
   adipose tissue [VAT] percentage), systemic (plasma corticosterone) and
   local (HSD11B1 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle [SkM] and VAT) stress,
   whole-body and peripheral insulin sensitivity were determined in this
   study. After four weeks of caloric restriction, R4 rats showed increases
   in systemic and local stress, decreases in visceral fat accumulation and
   no IR (whole-body or peripheral). Yet, after re-feeding, sustained
   systemic and local stress, remarkable visceral fat accumulation and IR
   (whole-body and peripheral) were found in RN4 compared with NC8, in RH4
   compared with NC8 and HF8. Our findings demonstrated that CUGA rats were
   characterized by significant IR, visceral fat accumulation and stress.
   These changes were more severe in CUGA re-fed with high-fat diet. The
   interaction of sustained caloric restriction-induced stress and
   re-feeding might be of utmost importance in the etiology of visceral fat
   accumulation and IR in CUGA.

TI Protocadherin 17 acts as a tumour suppressor inducing tumour cell
   apoptosis and autophagy, and is frequently methylated in gastric and
   colorectal cancers
SO JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Gastric and colorectal cancers are among the most common cancers
   worldwide and cause serious cancer mortality. Both epigenetic and
   genetic disruptions of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) are frequently
   involved in their pathogenesis. Here, we studied the epigenetic and
   genetic alterations of a novel TSG-PCDH17 and its functions in the
   pathogenesis of these tumours. We found that PCDH17 was frequently
   silenced and methylated in almost all gastric and colorectal tumour cell
   lines as well as in similar to 95% of primary tumours, but not in normal
   gastric and colonic mucosa. Moreover, its deletion was detected in only
   18% of gastric and 12% of colorectal cancer tissues, suggesting that
   epigenetic and genetic inactivation of PCDH17 are both involved in
   gastric and colorectal tumourigenesis. PCDH17 protein expression was
   significantly correlated with low tumour stage and less lymph node
   metastasis of gastric and colorectal cancer patients, indicating its
   potential as a tumour marker. Restoring PCDH17 expression inhibited
   tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo through promoting apoptosis, as
   evidenced by increased TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activation.
   Furthermore, PCDH17-induced autophagy, along with increased numbers of
   autophagic vacuoles and up-regulated autophagic proteins Atg-5, Atg-12
   and LC3B II. Thus, PCDH17 acts as a tumour suppressor, exerting its
   anti-proliferative activity through inducing apoptosis and autophagy,
   and is frequently silenced in gastric and colorectal cancers. PCDH17
   methylation is a tumour-specific event that could serve as an epigenetic
   biomarker for these tumours. Copyright (C) 2012 Pathological Society of

TI Effects of Antipsychotics on the BDNF in Schizophrenia
SO CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is involved in the development
   of the brain, and likely influences the neuroplasticity in
   schizophrenia. BDNF is also believed to interact with other
   neurotransmitter systems implicated in schizophrenia, such as dopamine,
   glutamate, serotonin and GABA. Therefore, BDNF is a candidate gene for
   schizophrenia. In past decades, the blood (serum or plasma) BDNF protein
   levels and BDNF gene alleles and genotypes to the clinical features of
   schizophrenia, such as age of onset, clinical subtypes, symptom
   severity, and drug response, have been evaluated among different
   populations. However, the results are still inconsistent. Further,
   different drugs have been reported to have different effects on BDNF
   protein levels. A cross-sectional survey revealed that serum BDNF levels
   in chronic schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine exceeded those
   of patients treated with risperidone or with typical antipsychotics. In
   recent times, BDNF epigenetic studies have also been conducted in
   clinical studies of schizophrenia to address the question of why
   patients with the same gene genotype and alleles have different clinical
   presentations. In addition, the effects of different antipsychotic drugs
   on gene methylation and protein acetylation have also been reported. In
   conclusion, more data are needed regarding BDNF in the brain and in
   peripheral blood, including protein levels, single nucleotide
   polymorphisms, epigenetic regulation, and clinical data in order to
   understand the role of BDNF in schizophrenia.

TI Small-molecular modulators of cancer-associated epigenetic mechanisms
SO MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS
AB DNA methylation and posttranslational histone modifications regulate
   expression of various genes independently of changes in the DNA
   sequence. Such epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in controlling
   cellular functions, including the cell cycle, immunoresponses and signal
   transduction. On the other hand, epigenetic aberrations are associated
   with oncogenesis and proliferation of cancer cells, and epigenetic
   alterations have been identified in many human cancer cells.
   Furthermore, chemical-biological approaches have uncovered relationships
   between epigenetic dysregulation and cancer, and several small molecules
   that modulate epigenetic mechanisms have already been approved for
   cancer therapy. In this review, we deal with chemical epigenetics
   relevant to cancer therapy, focusing especially on small molecules that

TI Integrated epigenomics identifies BMP4 as a modulator of cisplatin
   sensitivity in gastric cancer
SO GUT
AB Objective Cisplatin is a widely used gastric cancer (GC) chemotherapy;
   however, genetic factors regulating GC responses to cisplatin remain
   obscure. Identifying genes regulating cisplatin resistance could aid
   clinicians in tailoring treatments, by distinguishing cisplatin
   sensitive patients from those who might benefit from alternative
   platinum therapies, and highlight novel targeted strategies for
   overcoming cisplatin resistance. Here integrated epigenomics is applied
   to identify genes associated with GC cisplatin resistance.
   Design 20 GC cell lines were subjected to gene expression profiling, DNA
   methylation profiling and drug response assays. The molecular data were
   integrated to identify genes highly expressed and unmethylated
   specifically in cisplatin-resistant lines. Candidate genes were
   functionally tested by several in vitro and in vivo assays. Clinical
   impact of candidate genes was also assessed in a cohort of 197 GC
   patients.
   Results Epigenomic analysis identified bone morphogenetic protein 4
   (BMP4) as an epigenetically regulated gene highly expressed in
   cisplatin-resistant lines. Functional assays confirmed that BMP4 is
   necessary and sufficient for the expression of several prooncogenic
   traits, likely mediated through stimulation of the
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In primary tumours, BMP4 promoter
   methylation levels were inversely correlated with BMP4 expression, and
   patients with high BMP4-expressing tumours exhibited significantly worse
   prognosis. Therapeutically, targeted genetic inhibition of BMP4 caused
   significant sensitisation of GC cells to cisplatin. Notably,
   BMP4-expressing GCs also did not exhibit cross resistance to
   oxaliplatin.
   Conclusions BMP4 epigenetic and expression status may represent
   promising biomarkers for GC cisplatin resistance. Targeting BMP4 may
   sensitise GC cells to cisplatin. Oxaliplatin, a clinically acceptable
   cisplatin alternative, may represent a potential therapeutic option for
   BMP4-positive GCs.

TI Arabidopsis Chromatin Remodeling Factor PICKLE Interacts with
   Transcription Factor HY5 to Regulate Hypocotyl Cell Elongation
SO PLANT CELL
AB Photomorphogenesis is a critical plant developmental process that
   involves light-mediated transcriptome changes, histone modifications,
   and inhibition of hypocotyl growth. However, the chromatin-based
   regulatory mechanism underlying this process remains largely unknown.
   Here, we identify ENHANCED PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (EPP1), previously known as
   PICKLE (PKL), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor of the
   chromodomain/helicase/DNA binding family, as a repressor of
   photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that PKL/EPP1
   expression is repressed by light in the hypocotyls in a
   photoreceptor-dependentmanner. Furthermore, we reveal that the
   transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) binds to the promoters
   of cell elongation-related genes and recruits PKL/EPP1 through their
   physical interaction. PKL/EPP1 in turn negatively regulates HY5 by
   repressing trimethylation of histone H3 Lys 27 at the target loci,
   thereby regulating the expression of these genes and, thus, hypocotyl
   elongation. We also show that HY5 possesses transcriptional repression
   activity. Our study reveals a crucial role for a chromatin remodeling
   factor in repressing photomorphogenesis and demonstrates that
   transcription factor-mediated recruitment of chromatin-remodeling
   machinery is important for plant development in response to changing
   light environments.

TI The Unique Liquid-Based Cytologic Findings of Thyroid Signet-Ring
   Follicular Adenoma: A Report of Two Cases with Fine Needle Aspiration
   Cytology
SO ACTA CYTOLOGICA
AB Background: Signet-ring follicular adenoma is a rare variant of
   follicular neoplasm, which has only been described using the
   conventional smear cytologic preparation. Here we report the unique
   cytologic findings of two cases of signet-ring follicular adenoma using
   liquid-based samples and corresponding histologic features and results
   of ancillary tests. Cases: Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented with a
   solitary nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid. Ultrasound-guided fine
   needle aspiration (FNA) yielded several groups of microfollicles
   containing colloid or mucin-like globules. The tumor cells had
   eccentrically located nuclei compressed by distended luminal globules.
   Case 2: A 51-year-old woman presented with a nodule in the left lobe of
   the thyroid. On liquid-based cytology, cord-like arrangements of
   microfollicules were noted. The tumor cells had large, clear vacuoles,
   but the nuclei maintained their round shape and central location.
   Conclusion: The liquid-based cytologic characteristics are quite
   different from those encountered in the conventional smear of FNA;
   therefore, pathologists must also be familiar with the cytomorphologic
   characteristics of liquid-based preparations. In addition, given the
   distinctive cytological and histological appearance and the benign
   clinical course, signet-ring follicular adenoma should be distinguished
   from other metastatic neoplasms displaying signet-ring cell features.

TI Genetic and epigenetic integrity assessment of acclimatised papaya
   plants regenerated directly from shoot-tips following short- and
   long-term cryopreservation
SO PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE
AB A vitrification-based cryopreservation protocol was applied to in vitro
   sourced shoot-tips of four genotypes of Carica papaya; two female (70
   and Z6) and two male (B2 and B4). Regeneration of similar to 58 % (70)
   and similar to 59 % (Z6) was recorded for the female genotypes
   confirming previously published results. Regeneration was at similar to
   77 and similar to 53 % for the two male genotypes B2 and B4
   respectively. Cryo-tube storage and regeneration was tested after 2-18
   months storage in one male (B2) and one female (70) genotype.
   Regeneration post cryo-storage was similar to 1 h exposure to liquid
   nitrogen. Individual shoot-tips from the two female and two male
   genotypes were grown into complete in vitro plants, potted and
   acclimatised without micropropagation to provide material for randomly
   amplified DNA fingerprinting (RAF) and amplified DNA methylation
   polymorphism (AMP) analysis of multiple individuals from in vitro
   control, plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2) cryoprotectant control
   and short (1 h) and long-term cryopreservation treatment plants. No
   variations were detected for genotype Z6 control and treatment
   individuals and no RAF variations were detected in any individuals of
   genotype B2. Small numbers of RAF and AMP variations were detected in
   some individuals from genotypes B2 (AMP variation only), B4 and 70, but
   these were also found in controls. Genotype 70 showed the greatest level
   of variation; genomic DNA variation (RAF) was detected in control and
   cryopreservation treatment individuals, and the PVS2 control group was
   the only treatment group without variations for the respective AMP
   analysis. The variations observed could not be correlated with any
   phenotypic characteristics 2 months after acclimatisation.

TI Hypermethylation of p16 Tumor-Suppressor Gene in Ameloblastic Carcinoma,
   Ameloblastoma, and Dental Follicles
SO JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Purpose: The high rate of p16 gene alterations in malignant neoplasms
   suggests the important effect of this tumor-suppressor gene mutation on
   the malignant behavior of tumoral lesions. The present study
   investigated the possible methylation of the p16 tumor in ameloblastic
   carcinoma, ameloblastoma, and dental follicles.
   Materials and Methods: Eighteen samples of ameloblastic carcinoma,
   ameloblastoma, and dental follicles of mandibular impacted third molar
   were selected from available documents in the archives of the Department
   of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Taleghani Hospital and the
   Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Shahid Beheshti
   University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. After confirming the
   initial diagnosis, 6-mu m sections were used for DNA extraction. A CpG
   island methylation of p16 was identified by polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Although CpG methylation of p16 was observed in all
   ameloblastic carcinoma samples, only 1 ameloblastoma specimen exhibited
   the mutation. The mutation was not detected in other ameloblastoma
   specimens or in any dental follicle sample.
   Conclusions: The p16 alteration might play a role in the malignant
   progression of ameloblastic carcinoma. It is worth mentioning that
   ameloblastoma can be further differentiated from ameloblastic carcinoma
   based on molecular observations. (C) 2013 American Association of Oral

TI Are female offspring from a single-egg seabird more costly to raise?
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
AB If the fitness benefits gained from producing male and female offspring
   differ due to parental or environmental conditions, parents should
   adjust their level of investment accordingly. We studied sex allocation
   and reproductive investment in a population of common guillemots (Uria
   aalge) in 2 breeding seasons. The common guillemot is a single-egg
   species and the male is only slightly larger than the female implying
   small, if any differential costs of raising male and female offspring.
   We use 4 variables to characterize reproductive allocation: 1) sex of
   the chick at hatching, 2) adult male and female body condition, 3)
   baseline corticosterone (CORT) level of adults early and late in the
   chick-rearing period, and 4) body mass of the chicks just prior to
   fledging. Females that produced female offspring were in better body
   condition during early chick-rearing than those producing males and both
   parents raising a female offspring lost more body mass during the
   chick-rearing period. Female offspring were heavier than male offspring
   at the end of the chick-rearing period. Whereas hatching sex ratio was
   at unity in one of the years, it was strongly skewed toward females
   (72.5%) in the other year, and this pattern was consistent for a subset
   of pairs studied in both years. Early baseline CORT levels of adults
   were lower in the year when the sex ratio was skewed toward female
   offspring. We discuss this unexpected pattern of sex allocation in
   relation to variation in feeding conditions and the role of females in
   competing for good nesting sites.

TI Mechanism of transcription through a nucleosome by RNA polymerase II
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Efficient maintenance of chromatin structure during passage of RNA
   polymerase II (Pol II) is critical for cell survival and functioning.
   Moderate-level transcription of eukaryotic genes by Pol II is
   accompanied by nucleosome survival, extensive exchange of histones
   H2A/H2B and minimal exchange of histones H3/H4. Complementary in vitro
   studies have shown that transcription through chromatin by single Pol II
   complexes is uniquely coupled with nucleosome survival via formation of
   a small intranucleosomal DNA loop (empty set-loop) containing the
   transcribing enzyme. In contrast, transient displacement and exchange of
   all core histones are observed during intense transcription. Indeed,
   multiple transcribing Pc! II complexes can efficiently overcome the high
   nucleosomal barrier and displace the entire histone octamer in vitro.
   Thus, various Pol II complexes can remodel chromatin to different
   extents. The mechanisms of nucleosome survival and displacement during
   transcription and the role of DNA histone interactions and various
   factors during this process are discussed. This article is part of a

TI Effects of Transient Cerebral Ischemia on the Expression of DNA
   Methyltransferase 1 in the Gerbil Hippocampal CA1 Region
SO NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification of DNA that is
   catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt). Increasing evidences suggest
   that DNA methylation in neurons regulates synaptic plasticity as well as
   neuronal network activity. In the present study, we investigated the
   changes in DNA methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) immunoreactivity and its
   protein levels in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region after 5 min of
   transient global cerebral ischemia. CA1 pyramidal neurons were well
   stained with NeuN (a neuron-specific soluble nuclear antigen) antibody
   in the sham-group, Four days after ischemia-reperfusion (I-R),
   NeuN-positive ((+)) cells were significantly decreased in the stratum
   pyramidale (SP) of the CA1 region, and many Fluro-Jade B (a marker for
   neuronal degeneration)(+) cells were observed in the SP. Dnmt1
   immunoreactivity was well detected in all the layers of the sham-group.
   Dnmt1 immunoreactivity was hardly detected only in the stratum
   pyramidale of the CA1 region from 4 days post-ischemia; however, at
   these times, Dnmt1 immunoreactivity was newly expressed in GABAergic
   interneurons or astrocytes in the ischemic CA1 region. In addition, the
   level of Dnmt1 was lowest at 4 days post-ischemia. In brief, both the
   Dnmt1 immunoreactivity and protein levels were distinctively decreased
   in the ischemic CA1 region 4 days after transient cerebral ischemia.
   These results indicate that the decrease of Dnmt1 expression at 4 days
   post-ischemia may be related to ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death.

TI Epigenetic Regulation of CXCR4 Expression by the Ocular Microenvironment
SO INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE
AB PURPOSE. Expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by tumors is
   associated with metastatic migration and invasion of tumor cells. The
   importance of CXCR4 expression by uveal melanomas in metastasis to the
   liver was recently demonstrated when injection of CXCR4-negative uveal
   melanoma cells into mice resulted in reduced liver metastasis compared
   with CXCR4-positive uveal melanoma cells. Factors in the eye can induce
   downregulation of genes by epigenetic mechanisms. This study examined
   whether epigenetic regulation by the ocular environment induced
   downregulation of CXCR4 expression.
   METHODS. LS174T colon cancer cells were injected in the anterior chamber
   (AC), subcutaneously (SC), or in the spleen capsule to induce liver
   metastasis in immune-deficient mice. CXCR4 gene transcription was
   analyzed by RT-PCR, and protein expression was determined by flow
   cytometry. Methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activities were
   determined by ELISA. Treatment with either 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza)
   or trichostatin A (TSA) was used to induce demethylation or inhibit
   histone deacetylases, respectively.
   RESULTS. AC-derived LS174T cells showed lower CXCR4 gene expression
   compared with SC-, liver-derived, or wild-type tumor cells. AC-derived
   LS174T tumor cells expressed methyltransferase activity compared with
   SC-, liver-derived, and wild-type tumor cells. Deacetylase activity was
   elevated in AC-derived LS174T tumor cells compared with SC-derived,
   liver-derived, and wild-type tumor cells. Treatment of AC-derived LS174T
   tumor cells with 5-Aza upregulated CXCR4 expression. TSA treatment did
   not restore CXCR4 expression.
   CONCLUSIONS. These studies demonstrate that ocular microenvironment
   factors induce methylation and downregulation of tumor CXCR4 expression.

TI Nobiletin Ameliorates the Deficits in Hippocampal BDNF, TrkB, and
   Synapsin I Induced by Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress
SO EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB Background. Our previous study has demonstrated that nobiletin could
   reverse the behavioral alterations in stressed mice. However, the
   relation of its antidepressant-like action with neurotrophic molecular
   expression remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the
   antidepressant-like mechanism of nobiletin related to the neurotrophic
   system in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS).
   Methods. Depressive-like anhedonia (assessed by sucrose preference) and
   serum corticosterone secretion were evaluated in the CUMS, followed by
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its tropomyosin-related kinase
   receptor B (TrkB), and the downstream target synapsin I expressions in
   the hippocampus. Results. Anhedonia, which occurred within week 2, was
   rapidly ameliorated by nobiletin. While fluoxetine needed additional 2
   weeks to improve the anhedonia. In addition, nobiletin administration
   for 5 weeks significantly ameliorated CUMS-induced increase in serum
   corticosterone levels. Furthermore, we also found that CUMS-induced
   deficits of hippocampal BDNF, TrkB, and synapsin I were ameliorated by
   nobiletin. Conclusions. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   nobiletin produces rapidly acting antidepressant-like responses in the
   CUMS and imply that BDNF-TrkB pathway may play an important role in the
   antidepressant-like effect of nobiletin.

TI DNA Methyltransferases in Hematologic Malignancies
SO SEMINARS IN HEMATOLOGY
AB DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are the key enzymes for genome
   methylation, which plays an important role in epigenetically regulated
   gene expression and repression. Mouse models with conditional knockout
   of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNA methyltransferase 3A
   (DNMT3A) genes have revealed a role of DNA methylation in mediating the
   self-renewal and differentiation of normal hematopoietic stem cells
   (HSCs) and the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Recently, various mutations
   of DNMT3A and other DNA methylation regulators have been identified in
   hematologic malignancies. Functional analysis of these mutations may
   lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms, and even the
   discovery of new biomarkers and/or drug targets, as well as more
   rational design of therapeutic regimens. Moreover, DNMTs inhibitors as
   epigenetic drugs have already been approved by US Food and Drug
   Administration for clinical use and some clinical trials are currently
   underway in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML). This review focuses on the biology of DNMTs with
   regard to epigenetic regulation, HSC renewal/differentiation, and drug
   discovery for targeted therapy, and delineates the latest studies that
   have been conducted to unfold the relationship between aberrant DNMTs
   and hematologic malignancies. Semin Hematol 50:48-60. (C) 2013 Elsevier

TI Down-Modulation of Expression, or Dephosphorylation, of IG20/MADD in
   Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand-Resistant
   Thyroid Cancer Cells Makes Them Susceptible to Treatment with This
   Ligand
SO THYROID
AB Background: The IG20/MADD gene is overexpressed in thyroid cancer
   tissues and cell lines, and can contribute to tumor necrosis
   factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance. The ability
   of the MADD protein to resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis is dependent upon
   its phosphorylation by Akt. Interestingly, while TRAIL induces a
   significant reduction in the levels of phospho-Akt (pAkt) and
   phospho-MADD (pMADD) in TRAIL-sensitive cells, it fails to do so in
   TRAIL-resistant cells. In this study, we investigated if MADD
   phosphorylation by Akt was contributing to TRAIL resistance in thyroid
   cancer cells.
   Methods: We determined the susceptibility of different thyroid cancer
   cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by fluorescence-activated cell
   sorting (FACS) analysis. We tested for various TRAIL resistance factors
   by FACS analyses or for IG20/MADD expression by quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We determined the levels of
   pAkt and pMADD upon TRAIL treatment in thyroid cancer cells by Western
   blotting. We tested if down-modulation of IG20/MADD gene expression
   using shRNA or phosphorylation using a dominant negative Akt (DN-Akt) or
   pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, could help overcome
   TRAIL resistance.
   Result: BCPAP and TPC1 cells were susceptible, while KTC1 and FTC133
   cells were resistant, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The differential
   susceptibility to TRAIL was not related to the levels of expression of
   death receptors, decoy receptors, or TRAIL. KTC1 and FTC133 cells showed
   higher levels of IG20/MADD expression relative to BCPAP and TPC1, and
   were rendered susceptible to TRAIL treatment upon IG20/MADD knockdown.
   Interestingly, upon TRAIL treatment, the pAkt and pMADD levels were
   reduced in TRAIL-sensitive BCPAP and TPC1 cells, while they remained
   unchanged in the resistant KTC1 and FTC133 cells. While expression of a
   constitutively active Akt in BCPAP and TPC1 cells rendered them
   resistant to TRAIL, pretreating KTC1 and FTC133 cells with LY294002
   rendered them TRAIL-sensitive. Moreover, expression of a DN-Akt in KTC1
   and FTC133 cells reduced the levels of pAkt and pMADD and sensitized
   them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
   Conclusion: Our results show that pMADD is an important TRAIL resistance
   factor in certain thyroid cancer cells and suggest that down-modulation
   of either IG20/MADD expression or phosphorylation can render
   TRAIL-resistant thyroid cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL.

TI Impact of Enhanced Detection on the Increase in Thyroid Cancer Incidence
   in the United States: Review of Incidence Trends by Socioeconomic Status
   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry,
   1980-2008
SO THYROID
AB Background: In the past 3 decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer in
   the United States has been increasing. There has been debate on whether
   the increase is real or an artifact of improved diagnostic scrutiny. Our
   hypothesis is that both improved detection and a real increase have
   contributed to the increase.
   Methods: Because socioeconomic status (SES) may be a surrogate for
   access to diagnostic technology, we compared thyroid cancer incidence
   trends between high- and low-SES counties within the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results 9 (SEER 9) registries. The incidence
   trends were assessed using joinpoint regression analysis.
   Results: In high-SES counties, thyroid cancer incidence increased
   moderately (annual percentage change 1 [APC1] = 2.5, p < 0.05) before
   the late 1990s and more pronounced (APC2 = 6.3, p < 0.05) after the late
   1990s. In low-SES counties, incidence increased steadily with an APC of
   3.5 (p < 0.05) during the entire study period (1980-2008). For tumors <=
   4.0 cm, incidence was higher in high-SES counties, and APC was higher
   for high-than low-SES counties after the late 1990s. For tumors >4.0 cm,
   high- and low-SES counties had similar increasing incidence trends.
   Similarly, for tumors <= 2.0 cm, the incidence trends differed between
   counties that are in or adjacent to metropolitan areas and counties that
   are in rural areas, whereas for tumors >2.0 cm, all counties regardless
   of area of residence had similar increasing trends.
   Conclusions: Enhanced detection likely contributed to the increased
   thyroid cancer incidence in the past decades, but cannot fully explain
   the increase, suggesting that a true increase exists. Efforts should be
   made to identify the cause of this true increase.

TI Protective effects of nizofenone administration on the cognitive
   impairments induced by chronic restraint stress in mice
SO PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR
AB The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of nizofenone
   administration on the chronic restraint stress-induced cognitive
   impairments in mice. Adult male mice were randomized into five groups:
   control group, nizofenone control group, chronic restraint stress group,
   and nizofenone treatment groups (3.0 mg/kg and 9.0 mg/kg). The changes
   of cognitive performances were examined by Morris water maze (MWM), open
   field and step-through tests. Our results showed that the cognitive
   performances in CRS group were markedly deteriorated, accompanied by
   noticeable alterations in oxidative parameters, acetylcholinesterase
   activity and catecholamines levels in the hippocampus and the prefrontal
   cortex. These changes could be reversed by nizofenone treatment.
   Moreover, CRS group showed higher corticosterone levels and lower
   catecholamines levels in the serum, which were reversed in the
   nizofenone treatment groups. Collectively, the present results suggested
   the potential of nizofenone in attenuating the CRS-induced cognitive
   impairments. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Evidence for the binding affinity of daunomycin to HMGB1 protein in
   chromatin and in solution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB In this study the interaction of daunomycin with HMGB1 nonhistone
   chromatin protein in the chromatin context using hydroxyapatite (HAP)
   column chromatography and free in solution was investigated employing
   fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and thermal denaturation
   techniques. The results demonstrate that HMGB1 fraction eluted from HAP
   column contained the most amount of daunomycin. Upon addition of
   daunomycin to HMGB1 solution, fluorescence emission intensity was
   dependent on the drug concentration used whereas the ellipticity in CD
   spectra was decreased at both 205 and 220 nm extremes implying that
   quenching of the drug with the HMGB1 chromospheres alters secondary
   structure of the protein. Although daunomycin slightly increased the
   melting point of HMGB1, but exhibited a significant hyperchromicity at
   low concentrations and hypochromicity at higher concentrations of
   daunomycin. The results suggest that daunomycin binds to HMGB1 protein
   which may influence its interaction with DNA in nucleosomes and other
   cellular processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterization of Calu-3 cell monolayers as a model of bronchial
   epithelial transport: organic cation interaction studies
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG TARGETING
AB Background: To fully exploit organic cation transporters for targeted
   drug delivery in the lung, the use of a readily available and
   well-characterized tissue culture model and cheap easily detectable
   substrates is indispensable.
   Objectives: To investigate the suitability of Calu-3 as tissue model for
   characterizing organic cation permeation across the bronchial cells
   using a fluorescent dye, 4-(4-(Dimethylamino) styryl)-N-methylpyridinium
   iodide (4-DI-1-ASP).
   Methods: Substrate uptake, inhibition, and transport were performed to
   establish active transport mechanism. Organic cation transporter
   expression was determined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (qPCR), immune-histochemistry, and fluorescent microscopy.
   Results: 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in Calu-3 cells was concentration (K(m) = 2.7
   +/- 0.3 mM, V(max) = 4.6 +/- 2.6 nmol/mu g protein/30 min), temperature
   (uptake at 37 degrees C>>4 degrees C), and pH dependent (higher uptake
   at pH = 7). L-carnitine, verapamil, and corticosterone significantly
   inhibited its uptake with IC(50) of 28.2, 0.81, and 0.12 mM,
   respectively. Transport of the dye across the cells was polarized (AP ->
   BL transport was 2.5-fold > BL -> AP), saturable (Km = 43.9 +/- 3.2) (mu
   M; Vmax = 0.0228 +/- nmol/cm(2)/sec) and reduced 3-fold by metabolic
   inhibition. The expression pattern of the organic cation transporters
   (OCT) and carnitine/organic cation transporter (OCTN) isoforms was:
   OCT1<<OCT3 <OCTN1 <OCTN2; OCT2 was not detected.
   Conclusions: Based on qPCR, immunohistochemistry, uptake and transport
   data, the Calu-3 cells can be used as a model for not only studying
   strategies for optimizing the effect of inhaled organic cations, but
   also for cross-validating newly-developed respiratory cell lines.

TI Accurate determination of tissue steroid hormones, precursors and
   conjugates in adult male rat
SO JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The actual levels of steroid hormones in organs are vital for endocrine,
   reproductive and neuronal health and disorders. We developed an accurate
   method to determine the levels of steroid hormones and steroid
   conjugates in various organs by an efficient preparation using a
   solid-phase-extraction cartridge. Each steroid was identified by the
   precursor ion spectra using liquid chromatography-electrospray
   ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the respective steroids
   were quantitatively analysed in the selected reaction monitoring mode by
   liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The
   data showed that significant levels of testosterone, corticosterone and
   precursors of both hormones were detected in all organs except liver.
   The glucuronide conjugates of steroid hormones and the precursors were
   detected in all organs except liver, but sulfate conjugates of these
   steroids were observed only in the target organs of the hormones and
   kidney. Interestingly, these steroids and the conjugates were not
   observed in the liver except pregnenolone. In conclusion, an accurate
   determination of tissue steroids was developed using LC-MS analysis.
   Biosynthesis of steroid hormones from the precursors was estimated even
   in the target organs, and the delivery of these steroid conjugates was
   also suggested via the circulation without any significant hepatic
   participation.

TI Peripuberty stress leads to abnormal aggression, altered amygdala and
   orbitofrontal reactivity and increased prefrontal MAOA gene expression
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Although adverse early life experiences have been found to increase
   lifetime risk to develop violent behaviors, the neurobiological
   mechanisms underlying these long-term effects remain unclear. We present
   a novel animal model for pathological aggression induced by peripubertal
   exposure to stress with face, construct and predictive validity. We show
   that male rats submitted to fear-induction experiences during the
   peripubertal period exhibit high and sustained rates of increased
   aggression at adulthood, even against unthreatening individuals, and
   increased testosterone/corticosterone ratio. They also exhibit
   hyperactivity in the amygdala under both basal conditions (evaluated by
   2-deoxy-glucose autoradiography) and after a resident-intruder (RI) test
   (evaluated by c-Fos immunohistochemistry), and hypoactivation of the
   medial orbitofrontal (MO) cortex after the social challenge. Alterations
   in the connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala
   were linked to the aggressive phenotype. Increased and sustained
   expression levels of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene were found in
   the prefrontal cortex but not in the amygdala of peripubertally stressed
   animals. They were accompanied by increased activatory acetylation of
   histone H3, but not H4, at the promoter of the MAOA gene. Treatment with
   an MAOA inhibitor during adulthood reversed the peripuberty
   stress-induced antisocial behaviors. Beyond the characterization and
   validation of the model, we present novel data highlighting changes in
   the serotonergic system in the prefrontal cortex-and pointing at
   epigenetic control of the MAOA gene-in the establishment of the link
   between peripubertal stress and later pathological aggression. Our data
   emphasize the impact of biological factors triggered by peripubertal
   adverse experiences on the emergence of violent behaviors. Translational

TI Maternal Thyroid Hormone Parameters during Early Pregnancy and Birth
   Weight: The Generation R Study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Maternal hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is associated with an
   increased risk of low birth weight, predisposing to neonatal morbidity
   and mortality. However, the effects of variation in maternal serum
   thyroid parameters within the normal range on birth weight are largely
   unknown.
   Objective: The aim was to study the effects of early pregnancy maternal
   serum thyroid parameters within the normal range on birth weight, as
   well as the relation between umbilical cord thyroid parameters and birth
   weight.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: In early pregnancy, serum TSH, FT4
   (free T-4), and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels were determined in
   4464 pregnant women. Cord serum TSH and FT4 levels were determined in
   2724 newborns. Small size for gestational age at birth (SGA) was defined
   as a gestational age-adjusted birth weight below the 2.5th percentile.
   The associations between normal-range maternal and cord thyroid
   parameters, birth weight, and SGA were studied using regression
   analyses.
   Results: In mothers with normal-range FT4 and TSH levels, higher
   maternal FT4 levels were associated with lower birth weight [beta =
   -15.4 (3.6) g/pmol . liter, mean (SE); P = 1.6 x 10(-5)], as well as
   with an increased risk of SGA newborns [odds ratio (95% confidence
   interval) = 1.09 (1.01-1.17); P = 0.03]. Birth weight was positively
   associated with both cord TSH [beta = 4.1 (1.4) g/mU . liter; P = 0.007]
   and FT4 levels [beta = 23.0 (3.2) g/pmol . liter; P = 9.2 x 10(-13)].
   Conclusions: We show that maternal high-normal FT4 levels in early
   pregnancy are associated with lower birth weight and an increased risk
   of SGA newborns. Additionally, birth weight is positively associated
   with cord TSH and FT4 levels. These data demonstrate that even mild
   variation in thyroid function within the normal range can have important
   fetal consequences. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 59-66, 2013)

TI Immune Function in an Avian Brood Parasite and Its Nonparasitic Relative
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY
AB Organisms that breed multiple times must trade off resources between
   current and future reproduction. In many species, sexual selection can
   lead to reduced levels of immune function in males because they invest
   heavily in current reproduction at the expense of self-maintenance. Much
   less is known about whether the same trend is seen in species such as
   the brood-parasitic brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater (hereafter
   "cowbird"), in which females invest heavily in current reproduction. We
   examined two measures of immune function (bactericidal capacity of the
   plasma and the phytohemagglutinin swelling response) and baseline levels
   of corticosterone in both sexes of the cowbird and its nonparasitic
   relative the red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus (hereafter
   "redwing") during the breeding and subsequent nonbreeding seasons. We
   found that female cowbirds exhibited significantly lower levels of both
   measures of immune function than did male cowbirds and female redwings
   during the breeding season but had comparable levels during the
   nonbreeding season. Female redwings, in contrast, exhibited higher or
   comparable levels of immune function when compared with male redwings
   during the breeding season. In conjunction with published accounts
   documenting significantly higher rates of mortality for female cowbirds
   compared with male cowbirds and the fact that female cowbirds produce
   very high numbers of eggs (25-65) in a single breeding season, our
   results suggest that female cowbirds invest heavily in current
   reproduction at the expense of self-maintenance.

TI Loss of WNK2 expression by promoter gene methylation occurs in adult
   gliomas and triggers Rac1-mediated tumour cell invasiveness
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB The gene encoding protein kinase WNK2 was recently identified to be
   silenced by promoter hypermethylation in gliomas and meningiomas,
   suggesting a tumour-suppressor role in these brain tumours. Following
   experimental depletion in cell lines, WNK2 was further found to control
   GTP-loading of Rac1, a signalling guanosine triphosphatase involved in
   cell migration and motility. Here we show that WNK2 promoter methylation
   also occurs in 17.5 (29 out of 166) of adult gliomas, whereas it is
   infrequent in its paediatric forms (1.6; 1 out of 66). Re-expression of
   WNK2 in glioblastoma cells presenting WNK2 gene silencing reduced cell
   proliferation in vitro, tumour growth in vivo and also cell migration
   and invasion, an effect correlated with reduced activation of Rac1. In
   contrast, when endogenous WNK2 was depleted from glioblastoma cells with
   unmethylated WNK2 promoter, changes in cell morphology, an increase in
   invasion and activation of Rac1 were observed. Together, these results
   validate the WNK2 gene as a recurrent target for epigenetic silencing in
   glia-derived brain tumours and provide first mechanistic evidence for a
   tumour-suppressing role of WNK2 that is related to Rac1 signalling and
   tumour cell invasion and proliferation.

TI Stress-dependent and gender-specific neuroregulatory roles of the apelin
   receptor in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to acute
   stress
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The neuropeptide apelin is expressed in hypothalamic paraventricular and
   supraoptic nuclei and mediates its effects via activation of the apelin
   receptor (APJ). Evidence suggests a role for apelin and APJ in mediating
   the neuroendocrine response to stress. To understand the physiological
   role of APJ in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   axis, we measured ACTH and corticosterone (CORT) plasma levels in male
   and female mice lacking APJ (APJ knockout, APJ KO) and in wild-type
   controls, in response to a variety of acute stressors. Exposure to mild
   restraint, systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
   insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and forced swim (FS) stressors elevated
   plasma ACTH and CORT levels in wild-type mice. Acute mild restraint
   significantly increased plasma ACTH and CORT to a similar level in APJ
   KO mice as in wild-type mice. However, an intact APJ was required for a
   conventional ACTH, but not CORT, response to LPS administration in male
   mice and to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in male and female mice. By
   contrast, APJ KO mice displayed an impaired CORT response to acute FS
   stress, regardless of gender. These data indicate that APJ has a role in
   regulation of the HPA axis response to some acute stressors and has a
   gender-specific function in peripheral immune activation of the HPA
   axis.

TI VITEX AGNUS-CASTUS ESSENTIAL OIL AFFECTS THYROID C CELLS AND BONE
   METABOLISM IN MIDDLE-AGED MALE RATS
SO ACTA VETERINARIA-BEOGRAD
AB Ageing in men is accompanied by an increased occurrence of osteoporosis,
   but traditional hormonal replacement therapy elevates the risk of
   developing endocrine cancer. Vitex agnus-castus L. (Vac) essential oil
   is commonly used as an alternative therapy for ageing symptoms in both
   men and women. It is known that calcitonin (CT), thyroid C cell hormone,
   inhibits bone resorption. The purpose of this experimental study was to
   investigate the influence of Vac essential oil administration on the
   immunohistomorphometric features of thyroid C cells and bone metabolism
   in 16-month-old male Wistar rats. The first group of animals (n = 8) was
   treated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 60 mg/kg of Vac essential oil once a
   day for 3 weeks. Control animals (n = 8) received sterile olive oil s.c.
   by the same schedule. After Vac treatment significant increases (p <
   0.05) were found in the volume of C cells (by 10%) and serum CT level
   (by 27%) compared with the controls. Serum osteocalcin (OC) and calcium
   (Ca2+) levels were 31% and 8% lower (p < 0.05) respectively, in
   comparison with the control group. These are the first experimental
   results suggesting that Vac essential oil stimulates thyroid C cells
   activity and decreases bone turnover in middle-aged male rats.

TI Chromatin and the genome integrity network
SO NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS
AB The maintenance of genome integrity is essential for organism survival
   and for the inheritance of traits to offspring. Genomic instability is
   caused by DNA damage, aberrant DNA replication or uncoordinated cell
   division, which can lead to chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations.
   Recently, chromatin regulators that shape the epigenetic landscape have
   emerged as potential gatekeepers and signalling coordinators for the
   maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we review chromatin functions
   during the two major pathways that control genome integrity: namely,
   repair of DNA damage and DNA replication. We also discuss recent
   evidence that suggests a novel role for chromatin-remodelling factors in
   chromosome segregation and in the prevention of aneuploidy.

TI Modification of chromosomal architecture in human spermatozoa with large
   vacuoles
SO ANDROLOGY
AB Human normal spermatozoa present a specific chromatin organization,
   illustrated particularly by the non-random chromosome positioning.
   Spermatozoa with large vacuoles, described using motile sperm organelle
   morphology organization (MSOME), are associated with nuclear
   alterations, such as abnormal chromatin condensation and aneuploidy. To
   question a probable association between large nuclear vacuoles and
   chromatin disorganization, we evaluated chromosomes X, Y and 18
   topography in normal spermatozoa (NS) compared with spermatozoa with
   large vacuoles (SLV). After centrifugation on a gradient density system,
   229 NS (spermatozoa presenting a normal nuclear shape and a vacuole area
   <6.5% of head area) from 10 normal semen samples and 221 SLV
   (spermatozoa presenting a vacuole area >13% of head area) from 10 semen
   samples with teratozoospermia were selected using MSOME. A three-colour
   FISH was carried out using alpha-satellite centromeric probes for
   chromosomes X, Y and 18. For each chromosome, longitudinal and spatial
   positioning of centromeres was analysed. Distribution of each chromosome
   was non-random in NS and in SLV, whatever the methodology used. Using
   longitudinal positioning, distribution of chromosome 18 and chromosome Y
   centromeres did not differ significantly between SLV and NS. On the
   contrary, chromosome X centromeres were more frequently positioned in
   the posterior region of sperm nucleus in SLV (p=0.01). Considering
   spatial positioning, distributions differed significantly between SN and
   SLV for chromosome Y (p=0.02) and chromosome 18 (p<10(-4)) and
   marginally for chromosome X (p=0.08). Our study concluded to a
   modification in chromosomes X, Y and 18 centromere topography between NS
   and SLV, representing a novel and supplementary evidence to argue
   chromatin disorganization in SLV.

TI Genomic differences in benign and malignant follicular thyroid tumours
   using 1-Mb array-comparative genomic hybridisation
SO EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
AB Currently there is a lack of objective markers that can reliably
   differentiate benign and malignant follicular thyroid tumours. Such
   markers are needed to avoid the morbidity and cost of diagnosing these
   lesions by a thyroid lobectomy and then a second operation to remove the
   remaining half of thyroid if cancer is found. The aim of this research
   was to look for genomic markers that might solve this important problem.
   Ethical approval for the project was obtained. DNA was extracted from
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and copy number analysed
   using an in-house produced 1-megabase genomic array by comparative
   genomic hybridization (1Mb-aCGH). Acceptable quality data were obtained
   in 25/26 (96 %) of adenomas and 17/28 (61 %) of carcinomas. Among the
   carcinomas, 11 were minimally invasive (MI), 5 widely invasive (WI) and
   there was one metastasis. Recurrent copy number changes distinguishing
   benign and malignant included +1p34.2-36.33, +1q, +13q12.11-14.3,
   +14q22.1-32.33, +20q and -22. +20q became more sensitive (36.4 %) for MI
   carcinomas, whereas +13q12.11-14.3 and +14q22.1-32.33 became more
   sensitive (66.7 %) for identifying WI cancers from adenomas. Only in the
   context of aneuploidy (3 adenomas, 3 MI, 3 WI) there were some specific
   copy number changes that could differentiate all aneuploid adenomas from

TI Differential effects of thyroid status on regional H(2)O(2) production
   in slow- and fast-twitch muscle of ducklings
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND
   ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB Birds seem to employ powerful physiological strategies to curb the
   harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) because they generally
   live longer than predicted by the free radical theory of aging. However,
   little is known about the physiological mechanisms that confer
   protection to birds against excessive ROS generation. Hence, we
   investigated the ability of birds to control mitochondrial ROS
   generation during physiologically stressful periods. In our study, we
   analyzed the relationship between the thyroid status and the function of
   intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria located in glycolytic
   and oxidative muscles of ducklings. We found that the intermyofibrillar
   mitochondria of both glycolytic and oxidative muscles down regulate ROS
   production when plasma T(3) levels rise. The intermyofibrillar
   mitochondria of the gastrocnemius muscle (an oxidative muscle) produced
   less ROS and were more sensitive than the pectoralis muscle (a
   glycolytic muscle) to changes in plasma T(3). Such differences in the
   ROS production by glycolytic and oxidative muscles were associated with
   differences in the membrane proton permeability and in the rate of free
   radical leakage within the respiratory chain. This is the first evidence
   which shows that in birds, the amount of ROS that the mitochondria
   release is dependent on: (1) their location within the muscle; (2) the
   type of muscle (glycolytic or oxidative) and (3) on the thyroid status.
   Reducing muscle mitochondrial ROS generation might be an important
   mechanism in birds to limit oxidative damage during periods of
   physiological stress.

TI Influence of thyroid state on cardiac and renal capillary density and
   glomerular morphology in rats
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The purpose was to analyse the cardiac and renal capillary density and
   glomerular morphology resulting from a chronic excess or deficiency of
   thyroid hormones (THs) in rats. We performed histopathological,
   morphometrical and immunohistochemical analyses in hypothyroid and
   hyperthyroid rats to evaluate the density of mesenteric, renal and
   cardiac vessels at 4 weeks after induction of thyroid disorders. The
   main angiogenic factors in plasma, heart and kidney were measured as
   possible mediators of vascular changes. Mesenteric vessel branching was
   augmented and decreased in hyper- and hypothyroid rats respectively. The
   numerical density of CD31-positive capillaries was higher in left and
   right ventricles and in cortical and medullary kidney from both hyper-
   and hypothyroid rats vs controls. Numbers of podocytes and glomeruli per
   square millimetre were similar among groups. Glomerular area and
   percentage mesangium were greater in the hyperthyroid vs control or
   hypothyroid groups. No morphological renal lesions were observed in any
   group. Vascularisation of the mesenteric bed is related to TH levels,
   but an increased capillarity was observed in heart and kidney in both
   thyroid disorders. This increase may be produced by higher tissue levels
   of angiogenic factors in hypothyroid rats, whereas haemodynamic factors
   would predominate in hyperthyroid rats. Our results also indicate that
   the renal dysfunctions of thyroid disorders are not related to cortical
   or medullary microvascular rarefaction and that the proteinuria of
   hyperthyroidism is not secondary to a podocyte deficit. Finally, TH or
   its analogues may be useful to increase capillarity in renal diseases
   associated with microvascular rarefaction.

TI Cohesin codes - interpreting chromatin architecture and the many facets
   of cohesin function
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB Sister chromatid tethering is maintained by cohesin complexes that
   minimally contain Smc1, Smc3, Mcd1 and Scc3. During S-phase,
   chromatin-associated cohesins are modified by the Eco1/Ctf7 family of
   acetyltransferases. Eco1 proteins function during S phase in the context
   of replicated sister chromatids to convert chromatin-bound cohesins to a
   tethering-competent state, but also during G2 and M phases in response
   to double-stranded breaks to promote error-free DNA repair. Cohesins
   regulate transcription and are essential for ribosome biogenesis and
   complete chromosome condensation. Little is known, however, regarding
   the mechanisms through which cohesin functions are directed. Recent
   findings reveal that Eco1-mediated acetylation of different lysine
   residues in Smc3 during S phase promote either cohesion or condensation.
   Phosphorylation and SUMOylation additionally impact cohesin functions.
   Here, we posit the existence of a cohesin code, analogous to the histone
   code introduced over a decade ago, and speculate that there is a
   symphony of post-translational modifications that direct cohesins to
   function across a myriad of cellular processes. We also discuss evidence
   that outdate the notion that cohesion defects are singularly responsible
   for cohesion-mutant-cell inviability. We conclude by proposing that
   cohesion establishment is linked to chromatin formation.

TI Ultrastructural studies of cilia formation during thyroid gland
   differentiation in grass snake embryos
SO MICRON
AB The process of ciliogenesis that accompanies the differentiation of the
   thyroid gland in grass snake Natrix natrix L. embryos was studied
   ultrastructurally. Based on this study, it can be concluded that the
   ciliogenesis occurred in two waves and that new centrioles duplicated
   via centriolar pathways. The first wave of ciliogenesis started in the
   post-mitotic thyrocytes before their polarisation. It ended
   approximately halfway through the developmental period. The second wave
   of ciliogenesis took place after the polarization of thyrocytes and
   before the resting phase of the embryonic thyroid. This wave of
   ciliogenesis stopped shortly before hatching when fully differentiated
   thyrocytes restarted their activity. During the first half of thyroid
   differentiation, the cilia were formed "intracellularly" but during the
   second half, they differentiated "extracellularly" In the
   differentiating thyrocytes one cilium per cell was found; however, it
   could not be excluded that more than one cilium per cell may be formed.
   These cilia lacked central fibres and therefore they had a 9 + 0 formula
   that suggested that they were immotile. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Chronic Social Instability Induces Anxiety and Defective Social
   Interactions Across Generations
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Chronic social instability during adolescence and early
   adulthood is known to produce a variety of long-lasting effects that may
   contribute to future psychiatric disorders. However, its potential to
   affect future generations has not been tested.
   Methods: Female and male mice were exposed to chronic social stress
   involving social instability and disruption of social hierarchy from
   postnatal day 27 to 76. After treatment, a group of animals was used to
   evaluate long-term behavioral effects of the stress exposure, and other
   mice were used to generate F1, F2, and F3 offspring, to test for
   behavioral effects across generations.
   Results: Chronic social instability during adolescence and early
   adulthood induces persistent behavioral alterations, including enhanced
   anxiety and social deficits that are transmitted predominantly to
   females across at least three generations. Both mothers and fathers can
   transmit all of these altered behaviors to their F1 offspring. However,
   only F1 fathers transmit all of them to their F2 and F3 daughters. In
   the F1 generation, enhanced anxiety and social deficits are associated
   with elevated serum corticosterone levels; however, in the F2 and F3
   generations, they are not.
   Conclusions: These findings support the idea that individual risk for
   psychiatric disorders that involve enhanced anxiety and/or social
   dysfunction may be dependent not only on the specific alleles of genes
   that are inherited from one's parents and on one's own experiences, but
   also on the experiences of one's parents when they were young.

TI Meta-Analysis Reveals that Genes Regulated by the Y Chromosome in
   Drosophila melanogaster Are Preferentially Localized to Repressive
   Chromatin
SO GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB The Drosophila Y chromosome is a degenerated, heterochromatic chromosome
   with few functional genes. Despite this, natural variation on the Y
   chromosome in D. melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on
   the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. It is not clear,
   however, whether these genes simply represent a random subset of the
   genome or whether specific functional properties are associated with
   susceptibility to regulation by Y-linked variation. Here, we present a
   meta-analysis of four previously published microarray studies of
   Y-linked regulatory variation (YRV) in D. melanogaster. We show that YRV
   genes are far from a random subset of the genome: They are more likely
   to be in repressive chromatin contexts, be expressed tissue
   specifically, and vary in expression within and between species than
   non-YRV genes. Furthermore, YRV genes are more likely to be associated
   with the nuclear lamina than non-YRV genes and are generally more likely
   to be close to each other in the nucleus (although not along
   chromosomes). Taken together, these results suggest that variation on
   the Y chromosome plays a role in modifying how the genome is distributed
   across chromatin compartments, either via changes in the distribution of
   DNA-binding proteins or via changes in the spatial arrangement of the
   genome in the nucleus.

SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB Nectoneanthes Imajima, 1972, which has been regarded as a synonym of
   Neanthes Kinberg, 1865 and later of Alitta Kinberg, 1865, is resurrected
   in the present study, with evidence showing that the type species of

   succinea (Leuckart, 1847), but a valid species. Nectoneanthes oxypoda
   and Neanthes succinea are redescribed with newly found characteristics.
   The following seven species are judged as junior synonyms of
   Nectoneanthes oxypoda: Nectoneanthes latipoda Paik, 1973; Nectoneanthes
   multignatha Wu, Sun and Yang, 1981; Nectoneanthes donghaiensis He, 1987;

   Nectoneanthes oxypoda and Nectoneanthes uchiwa sp. nov. which is
   described here. The combination Neanthes succinea is also resurrected,
   reversing the placement in Alitta. Neanthes succinea seems to have been
   introduced recently to Asia and Australia.

TI Staying put or leaving home: endocrine, neuroendocrine and behavioral
   consequences in male African striped mice
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Social flexibility occurs when individuals of both sexes can change
   their social and reproductive tactics, which in turn can influence the
   social system of an entire population. However, little is known
   regarding the extent to which individuals of socially flexible species
   vary in their social behavior and in the underlying physiological
   mechanisms that support different social tactics. The present study in
   African striped mice modeled in captivity three male tactics described
   from the field: (a) philopatric males remaining in the family; (b)
   solitary roamers; or (c) group-living breeding males. Sixteen pairs and
   their offspring were kept in captivity, while one male offspring from
   the family remained as singly housed after he reached 21 days of age.
   Differences in behavior, morphology, hormone and neuropeptide levels
   were tested, and physiological measurements were correlated with
   behavioral measurements. In standardized arena experiments group-living
   males (philopatrics and breeders) were significantly more aggressive
   than singly housed males, in agreement with previous data suggesting
   that group-living, but not roaming males, are territorial. Philopatric
   males showed signs of reproductive suppression, small testes, lower
   testosterone and higher corticosterone levels than their singly housed
   brothers. Higher levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) were measured in
   the PVN and BNST of singly housed males compared to group-living males.
   Based on these findings we hypothesize that roamers are physiologically
   primed, and capable, if the opportunity to mate arises, to release AVP,
   form social bonds and become territorial, thus quickly adopting the
   tactic as breeding male which would yield a higher reproductive success.

TI Decrease of Global Methylation Improves Significantly Hepatic
   Differentiation of Ad-MSCs: Possible Future Application for Urea
   Detoxification
SO CELL TRANSPLANTATION
AB Hepatocyte transplantation is considered to be an alternative to
   orthotopic liver transplantation. Cells can be used to bridge patients
   waiting for a donor organ, decrease mortality in acute liver failure,
   and support metabolic liver diseases. The limited availability of
   primary human hepatocytes for such applications has led to the
   generation of alternative hepatocyte-like cells from various adult stem
   or precursor cells. The aim of this study was to generate
   hepatocyte-like cells from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (Ad-MSCs) for clinical applications, which are available "off the
   shelf." Epigenetic changes in hepatocyte-like cells were induced by
   5-azacytidine, which, in combination with other supplements, leads to
   significantly improved metabolic and enzymatic activities compared to
   nontreated cells. Cells with sufficient hepatic features were generated
   with a four-step protocol: 5-azacytidine (step 1); epidermal growth
   factor (step 2); fibroblast growth factor-4, dexamethasone,
   insulin-transferrin-sodium-selenite, and nicotinamide (step 3); and
   hepatocyte growth factor, dexamethasone,
   insulin-transferrin-sodium-selenite, and nicotinamide (step 4).
   Generated differentiated cells had higher phase I (CYP1A1/2, CYP2E1,
   CYP2B6, CYP3A4) and phase II activities compared to the undifferentiated
   cells. A strong expression of CYP3A7 and a weak expression of 3A4, as
   well as the important detoxification markers alpha-fetoprotein and
   albumin, could also be detected at the mRNA level. Importantly, urea
   metabolism (basal, NH(4)-stimulated, NH(4)- and ornithine-stimulated)
   was comparable to freshly isolated human hepatocytes, and unlike
   cryopreserved human hepatocytes, this activity was maintained after 6
   months of cryopreservation. These findings suggest that these cells may
   be suitable for clinical application, especially for treatment of urea
   cycle disorders.

TI Localized DNA Demethylation at Recombination Intermediates during
   Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Gene Assembly
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Multiple epigenetic marks have been proposed to contribute to the
   regulation of antigen receptor gene assembly via V(D)J recombination.
   Here we provide a comprehensive view of DNA methylation at the
   immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene locus prior to and during V(D) J
   recombination. DNA methylation did not correlate with the histone
   modification state on unrearranged alleles, indicating that these
   epigenetic marks were regulated independently. Instead, pockets of
   tissue-specific demethylation were restricted to DNase I hypersensitive
   sites within this locus. Though unrearranged diversity (D(H)) and
   joining (J(H)) gene segments were methylated, DJ(H) junctions created
   after the first recombination step were largely demethylated in pro-,
   pre-, and mature B cells. Junctional demethylation was highly localized,
   B-lineage-specific, and required an intact tissue-specific enhancer, E
   mu. We propose that demethylation occurs after the first recombination
   step and may mark the junction for secondary recombination.

TI Distribution of the Vasotocin Subtype Four Receptor (VT4R) in the
   Anterior Pituitary Gland of the Chicken, Gallus gallus, and its Possible
   Role in the Avian Stress Response
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The neurohormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) in non mammalian vertebrates
   is homologous to arginine vasopressin (AVP) in mammals. Its actions are
   mediated via G protein-coupled receptors that belong to the
   vasotocin/mesotocin family. Because of the known regulatory effects of
   nonapeptide hormones on anterior pituitary functions, receptor subtypes
   in that family have been proposed to be located in anterior pituitary
   cells. Recently, an avian vasotocin receptor subtype designated VT4R has
   been cloned, which shares 69% sequence homology with a human vasopressin
   receptor, the V1aR. In the present study, a polyclonal antibody to the
   VT4R was developed and validated to confirm its specificity to the VT4R.
   The antibody was used to test the hypothesis that the VT4R is present in
   the avian anterior pituitary and is specifically associated with certain
   cell types, where its expression is modulated by acute stress. Western
   blotting of membrane protein extracts from pituitary tissue, the use of
   HeLa cells transfected with the VT4R and peptide competition assays all
   confirmed the specificity of the antibody to the VT4R. Dual-labelling
   immunofluorescence microscopy was utilised to identify pituitary cell
   types that contained immunoreactive VT4R. The receptor was found to be
   widely distributed throughout the cephalic lobe but not in the caudal
   lobe of the anterior pituitary. Immunoreactive VT4R was associated with
   corticotrophs. Approximately 89% of immunolabelled corticotrophs were
   shown to contain the VT4R. The immunoreactive VT4R was not found in
   gonadotrophs, somatotrophs or lactotrophs. To determine a possible
   functional role of the VT4R and previously characterised VT2R, gene
   expression levels in the anterior pituitary were determined after acute
   immobilisation stress by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
   chain reaction. The results showed a significant increase in plasma
   corticosterone levels (three-to four-fold), a significant reduction of
   VT4R mRNA and an increase of VT2R mRNA (P < 0.05) in acutely immobilised
   chicks compared to controls. The data suggest a role of the VT4R in the
   avian stress response.

TI Chromatin acetylation at transcription start sites and vitamin D
   receptor binding regions relates to effects of 1
   alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and histone deacetylase inhibitors on
   gene expression
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The nuclear hormone 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) or 1,25D) regulates its target genes via activation
   of the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) far more
   specifically than the chromatin modifier trichostatin A (TsA) via its
   inhibitory action on histone deacetylases. We selected the
   thrombomodulin gene locus with its complex pattern of five VDR binding
   sites and multiple histone acetylation and open chromatin regions as an
   example to investigate together with a number of reference genes, the
   primary transcriptional responses to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TsA.
   Transcriptome-wide, 18.4% of all expressed genes are either up-or
   down-regulated already after a 90 min TsA treatment; their response
   pattern to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TsA sorts them into at least six
   classes. TsA stimulates a far higher number of genes than 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and dominates the outcome of combined treatments.
   However, 200 TsA target genes can be modulated by 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)
   and more than 1000 genes respond only when treated with both compounds.
   The genomic view on the genes suggests that the degree of acetylation at
   transcription start sites and VDR binding regions may determine the
   effect of TsA on mRNA expression and its interference with 1
   alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Our findings hold true also for other HDAC
   inhibitors and may have implications on dual therapies using chromatin
   modifiers and nuclear receptor ligands.

SO AQUATIC BIOLOGY
AB Little is known about the marine life-history phase of the anadromous
   sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. The most widely accepted hypothesis
   suggests a hematophagous feeding phase of 2.5 yr. We captured and tagged
   (individually numbered T-bar anchor tags) 408 postmetamorphic sea
   lampreys during the onset of the hematophagous feeding phase in the
   River Ulla and its estuary (NW Spain). One marked sea lamprey was
   recaptured during its spawning migration (total length: 895 mm, weight:
   1218 g). This individual had been marked 13.5 mo before recapture, and
   had measured 218 mm and 20 g. Our results suggest that at least a
   portion of the sea lamprey population can reach adult size in 1 yr of
   hematophagous feeding. This further suggests a period between completion
   of metamorphosis and reproduction of 1.5 yr (18 to 20 mo).

   range: 1502820ngg1 ww), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT; range:
   58724ngg1 ww), and chlordanes (CHL; range: 11126ngg1 ww) dominated the
   OC profile followed by hexachlorobenzene (HCB; range: 1142ngg1 ww),
   mirex (range: 252ngg1 ww), and -hexachlorocyclohexane (-HCH; range:
   17ngg1 ww). Histological examination of the liver showed mononuclear
   cell infiltrations and granulomas in 10 and 6 gulls, respectively, while
   intense intrahepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) was found in two and
   focal necrosis in one gull. In kidney, glomerular sclerosis and
   adhesions was found in five and one gull, respectively. Thickening of
   the glomerular basement membranes and tubular necrosis was found in four
   and seven gulls, respectively, while mononuclear cell infiltrations were
   found in two individuals. In the thyroid gland, a high density of small
   follicles accompanied by follicular epithelial cell proliferation was
   observed in five glaucous gulls. Gulls with hepatic steatosis had
   significantly higher sigma DDT levels than the gulls without hepatic
   steatosis and a similar trend was found for sigma PCB. When normalizing
   OC concentrations for lipid content in liver, gulls with lipid
   granulomas had significantly lower -HCH and significantly higher mirex
   levels, respectively, than gulls without lipid granulomas. Also; gulls
   with thickening of the glomerular basement membranes had
   non-significantly higher sigma PCB levels than gulls without. The
   histological findings were similar to those of controlled laboratory
   studies and OC-contaminated wildlife (e.g., polar bears; Ursus
   maritimus) and the data of this study therefore suggest that OC exposure
   may be a co-factor in the development of organ alterations in glaucous
   gulls. However, other environmental factors such as age, element
   exposure, and infectious micropathogens cannot be ruled out as
   co-factors, and it is uncertain if the tissue changes found exert
   adverse health effects on the population of Svalbard glaucous gulls.

TI PACAP Controls Adrenomedullary Catecholamine Secretion and Expression of
   Catecholamine Biosynthetic Enzymes at High Splanchnic Nerve Firing Rates
   Characteristic of Stress Transduction in Male Mice
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The neuropeptide PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
   polypeptide) is a cotransmitter of acetylcholine at the adrenomedullary
   synapse, where autonomic regulation of hormone secretion occurs. We have
   previously reported that survival of prolonged metabolic stress in mice
   requires PACAP-dependent biosynthesis and secretion of adrenomedullary
   catecholamines (CAs). In the present experiments, we show that CA
   secretion evoked by direct high-frequency stimulation of the splanchnic
   nerve is abolished in native adrenal slices from male PACAP-deficient
   mice. Further, we demonstrate that PACAP is both necessary and
   sufficient for CA secretion ex vivo during stimulation protocols
   designed to mimic stress. In vivo, up-regulation of transcripts encoding
   adrenomedullary CA-synthesizing enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase,
   phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) in response to both psychogenic
   and metabolic stressors (restraint and hypoglycemia) is PACAP-dependent.
   Stressor-induced alteration of the adrenomedullary secretory cocktail
   also appears to require PACAP, because up-regulation of galanin mRNA is
   abrogated in male PACAP-deficient mice. Wefurther show that
   hypoglycemia-induced corticosterone secretion is not PACAP-dependent,
   ruling out the possibility that glucocorticoids are the main mediators
   of the aforementioned effects. Instead, experiments with bovine
   chromaffin cells suggest that PACAP acts directly at the level of the
   adrenal medulla. By integrating prolonged CA secretion, expression of
   biosynthetic enzymes and production of modulatory neuropeptides such as
   galanin, PACAP is crucial for adrenomedullary function. Importantly, our
   results show that PACAP is the dominant adrenomedullary neurotransmitter
   during conditions of enhanced secretory demand. (Endocrinology 154:

TI Maternal smoking as a model for environmental epigenetic changes
   affecting birthweight and fetal programming
SO MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB Although the association between maternal smoking and low birthweight
   infants has been well established, the mechanisms behind reduced fetal
   growth are still being elucidated. While many infants are exposed to
   tobacco smoke in utero, not all are born growth restricted or small for
   gestational age. Many hypotheses have emerged to explain the
   differential response to in utero maternal tobacco smoke exposure
   (MTSE). Studies have shown that both maternal and fetal genotypes may
   contribute to the discrepant outcomes. However, the contribution of
   epigenetic changes cannot be ignored. In this review we address two
   important questions regarding the effect of MTSE on the fetal epigenome.
   First, does exposure to maternal tobacco smoke in utero alter the fetal
   epigenome? Secondly, could these alterations be associated with the
   reduced fetal growth observed with MTSE?.

TI Epigenetic status of argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate
   lyase modulates autophagy and cell death in glioblastoma
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Arginine deprivation, either by nutritional starvation or exposure to
   ADI-PEG20, induces adaptive transcriptional upregulation of ASS1 and ASL
   in glioblastoma multiforme ex vivo cultures and cell lines. This
   adaptive transcriptional upregulation is blocked by neoplasia-specific
   CpG island methylation in either gene, causing arginine auxotrophy and
   cell death. In cells with methylated ASS1 or ASL CpG islands, ADI-PEG20
   initially induces a protective autophagic response, but abrogation of
   this by chloroquine accelerates and potentiates cytotoxicity.
   Concomitant methylation in the CpG islands of both ASS1 and ASL,
   observed in a subset of cases, confers hypersensitivity to ADI-PEG20.
   Cancer stem cells positive for CD133 and methylation in the ASL CpG
   island retain sensitivity to ADI-PEG20. Our results show for the first
   time that epigenetic changes occur in both of the two key genes of
   arginine biosynthesis in human cancer and confer sensitivity to
   therapeutic arginine deprivation. We demonstrate that methylation status
   of the CpG islands, rather than expression levels per se of the genes,
   predicts sensitivity to arginine deprivation. Our results suggest a
   novel therapeutic strategy for this invariably fatal central nervous
   system neoplasm for which we have identified robust biomarkers and which
   overcomes the limitations to conventional chemotherapy imposed by the
   blood/brain barrier. Cell Death and Disease (2013) 4, e458;

TI S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase and methylation disorders: Yeast as
   a model system
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methylation is central to the
   regulation of many biological processes: more than 50 AdoMet-dependent
   methyltransferases methylate a broad spectrum of cellular compounds
   including nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Common to all
   AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase reactions is the release of the
   strong product inhibitor S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy), as a
   by-product of the reaction. S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase is the
   only eukaryotic enzyme capable of reversible AdoHcy hydrolysis to
   adenosine and homocysteine and, thus, relief from AdoHcy inhibition.
   Impaired S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase activity in humans results
   in AdoHcy accumulation and severe pathological consequences.
   Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is characterized by elevated levels of
   homocysteine in blood, also exhibits a similar phenotype of AdoHcy
   accumulation due to the reversal of the direction of the
   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase reaction. Inhibition of
   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase is also linked to antiviral effects.
   In this review the advantages of yeast as an experimental system to
   understand pathologies associated with AdoHcy accumulation will be
   discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cyclooxygenase, Cancer Stem Cells and DNA Methylation Play Important
   Roles in Colorectal Carcinogenesis
SO DIGESTION
AB Many effective anticancer therapies against colorectal cancer have been
   developed, but chemoresistance and recurrence are still inevitable
   problems and their counter measures are urgently needed. Recently,
   cancer stem cells have been indicated to play a pivotal role in
   chemoresistance and recurrence and have gained attention as a novel
   target. On the other hand, both aberrant hyper- and hypomethylation have
   been shown to be involved in carcinogenesis and the simultaneous
   amendment is indispensable. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has already been
   reported to play an important role in carcinogenesis. Our latest study
   indicates that COX-2 inhibitors remedy aberrant methylation and beat
   cancer sternness, suggesting that COX-2 inhibitors hold great promise
   for cancer prevention and therapy. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG,

TI Ingestion of theanine, an amino acid in tea, suppresses psychosocial
   stress in mice
SO EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB The antistress effect of theanine (gamma-glutamylethylamide), an amino
   acid in tea, was investigated using mice that were psychosocially
   stressed from a conflict among male mice in conditions of
   confrontational housing. Two male mice were housed in the same cage
   separated by a partition to establish a territorial imperative. When the
   partition was removed, the mice were co-housed confrontationally. As a
   marker for the stress response, changes in the adrenal gland were
   studied in comparison to group-housed control mice (six mice in a cage).
   Significant adrenal hypertrophy was observed in mice during
   confrontational housing, which was developed within 24 h and persisted
   for at least 1 week. The size of cells in the zona fasciculata of the
   adrenal gland, from which glucocorticoid is mainly secreted, increased
   (similar to 1.11-fold) in mice during confrontational housing, which was
   accompanied by a flattened diurnal rhythm of corticosterone and ACTH in
   blood. The ingestion of theanine (>5 mu g ml(-1)) prior to
   confrontational housing significantly suppressed adrenal hypertrophy. An
   antidepressant, paroxetin, suppressed adrenal hypertrophy in a similar
   manner in mice during confrontational housing. In mice that ingested
   theanine, behavioural depression was also suppressed, and a diurnal
   rhythm of corticosterone and ACTH was observed, even in mice that were
   undergoing confrontational housing. Furthermore, the daily dose of
   theanine (40 mu g ml(-1)) blocked the counteracting effects of caffeine
   (30 mu g ml(-1)) and catechin (200 mu g ml(-1)). The present study
   demonstrated that theanine prevents and relieves psychosocial stress
   through the modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity.

TI Maternal and Fetal Exposure to Bisphenol A Is Associated with
   Alterations of Thyroid Function in Pregnant Ewes and Their Newborn Lambs
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The putative thyroid-disrupting properties of bisphenol A (BPA)
   highlight the need for an evaluation of fetal exposure and its
   consequence on the mother/newborn thyroid functions in models relevant
   to human. The goals of this study were to characterize in sheep a
   relevant model for human pregnancy and thyroid physiology, the internal
   exposures of the fetuses and their mothers to BPA and its main
   metabolite BPA-glucuronide (Gluc), and to determine to what extent it
   might be associated with thyroid disruption. Ewes were treated with BPA
   [5 mg/(kg . d) sc] or vehicle from d 28 until the end of pregnancy.
   Unconjugated BPA did not appear to accumulate in pregnant ewes, and its
   concentration was similar in the newborns and their mothers (0.13 +/-
   0.02 and 0.18 +/- 0.03 nmol/ml in cord and maternal blood,
   respectively). In amniotic fluid and cord blood, BPA-Gluc concentrations
   were about 1300-fold higher than those of BPA. Total T(4) concentrations
   were decreased in BPA-treated pregnant ewes and in the cord and the
   jugular blood of their newborns (30% decrease). A similar difference was
   observed for free T(4) plasma concentrations in the jugular blood of the
   newborns. Our results show in a long-gestation species with a similar
   regulatory scheme of thyroid function as humans that BPA in utero
   exposure can be associated with hypothyroidism in the newborns. If such
   an effect were to be confirmed for a more relevant exposure scheme to
   BPA, this would constitute a major issue for BPA risk assessment.

TI Stacking the DEK From chromatin topology to cancer stem cells
SO CELL CYCLE
AB Stem cells are essential for development and tissue maintenance and
   display molecular markers and functions distinct from those of
   differentiated cell types in a given tissue. Malignant cells that
   exhibit stem cell-like activities have been detected in many types of
   cancers and have been implicated in cancer recurrence and drug
   resistance. Normal stem cells and cancer stem cells have striking
   commonalities, including shared cell surface markers and signal
   transduction pathways responsible for regulating quiescence vs.
   proliferation, self-renewal, pluripotency and differentiation. As the
   search continues for markers that distinguish between stem cells,
   progenitor cells and cancer stem cells, growing evidence suggests that a
   unique chromatin-associated protein called DEK may confer stem cell-like
   qualities. Here, we briefly describe current knowledge regarding stem
   and progenitor cells. We then focus on new findings that implicate DEK
   as a regulator of stem and progenitor cell qualities, potentially
   through its unusual functions in the regulation of local or global
   chromatin organization.

TI Neurobiological Sequelae of Witnessing Stressful Events in Adult Mice
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: It is well known that exposure to severe stress increases
   the risk for developing mood disorders. However, most chronic stress
   models in rodents involve at least some form of physically experiencing
   traumatic events.
   Methods: This study assessed the effects of a novel social stress
   paradigm that is insulated from the effects of physical stress.
   Specifically, adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either emotional
   (ES) or physical stress (PS) for 10 minutes per day for 10 days. The ES
   mice were exposed to the social defeat of a PS mouse by a larger, more
   aggressive CD-1 mouse from the safety of an adjacent compartment.
   Results: Like PS mice, ES mice exhibited a range of depression-and
   anxiety-like behaviors both 24 hours and 1 month after the stress.
   Increased levels of serum corticosterone, part of the stress response,
   accompanied these behavioral deficits. Based on previous work that
   implicated gene expression changes in the ventral tegmental area (a key
   brain reward region) in the PS phenotype, we compared genome-wide mRNA
   expression patterns in this brain region of ES and PS mice using
   RNA-seq. We found significant overlap between these conditions, which
   suggests several potential gene targets for mediating the behavioral
   abnormalities observed.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that witnessing traumatic events
   is a potent stress in adult male mice capable of inducing long-lasting
   neurobiological perturbations.

TI Overload training inhibits phagocytosis and ROS generation of peritoneal
   macrophages: role of IGF-1 and MGF
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB We tested the hypothesis that overload training inhibits the
   phagocytosis and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of
   peritoneal macrophages (MI center dot s), and that insulin-like growth
   factor-1(IGF-1) and mechano-growth factor (MGF) produced by macrophages
   may contribute to this process. Rats were randomized to two groups,
   sedentary control group (n = 10) and overload training group (n = 10).
   The rats of overload training group were subjected to 11 weeks of
   experimental training protocol. Blood sample was used to determine the
   content of hemoglobin, testosterone, and corticosterone. The
   phagocytosis and the ROS generation of MI center dot s were measured by
   the uptake of neutral red and the flow cytometry, respectively. IGF-1
   and MGF mRNA levels in MI center dot s were determined by real-time PCR.
   In addition, we evaluated the effects of IGF-1 and MGF peptide on
   phagocytosis and ROS generation of MI center dot s in vitro. The data
   showed that overload training significantly decreased the body weight
   (19.3 %, P < 0.01), the hemoglobin (13.5 %, P < 0.01), the testosterone
   (55.3 %, P < 0.01) and the corticosterone (40.6 %, P < 0.01) in blood.
   Moreover, overload training significantly decreased the phagocytosis (27
   %, P < 0.05) and the ROS generation (35 %, P < 0.01) of MI center dot s.
   IGF-1 and MGF mRNA levels in MI center dot s from overload training
   group increased significantly compared with the control group (21-fold
   and 92-fold, respectively; P < 0.01). In vitro experiments showed that
   IGF-1 had no significant effect on the phagocytosis and the ROS
   generation of MI center dot s. Unlike IGF-1, MGF peptide impaired the
   phagocytosis of MI center dot s in dose-independent manner. In addition,
   MGF peptide of some concentrations (i.e., 1, 10, 50, 100 ng/ml)
   significantly inhibited the ROS generation of MI center dot s. These
   results suggest that overload training inhibits the phagocytosis and the
   ROS generation of peritoneal macrophages, and that MGF produced by
   macrophages may play a key role in this process. This may represent a
   novel mechanism of immune suppression induced by overload training.

TI MicroRNAs regulate methionine adenosyltransferase 1A expression in
   hepatocellular carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and methionine ad enosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) are
   dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and reduced MAT1A
   expression correlates with worse HCC prognosis. Expression of miR-664,
   miR-485-3p, and miR-495, potential regulatory miRNAs of MAT1A, is
   increased in HCC. Knockdown of these miRNAs individually in Hep3B and
   HepG2 cells induced MAT1A expression, reduced growth, and increased
   apoptosis, while combined knockdown exerted additional effects on all
   parameters. Subcutaneous and intraparenchymal injection of Hep3B cells
   stably overexpressing each of this trio of miRNAs promoted tumorigenesis
   and metastasis in mice. Treatment with miRNA-664 (miR-664), miR-485-3p,
   and miR-495 siRNAs reduced tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in an
   orthotopic liver cancer model. Blocking MAT1A induction significantly
   reduced the antitumorigenic effect of miR-495 siRNA, whereas maintaining
   MAT1A expression prevented miRNA-mediated enhancement of growth and
   metastasis. Knockdown of these miRNAs increased total and nuclear level
   of MAT1A protein, global CpG methylation, lin-28 homolog B
   (Caenorhabditis elegans) (LIN28B) promoter methylation, and reduced
   LIN28B expression. The opposite occurred with forced expression of these
   miRNAs. In conclusion, upregulation of miR-664, miR-485-3p, and miR-495
   contributes to lower MAT1A expression in HCC, and enhanced tumorigenesis
   may provide potential targets for HCC therapy.

TI Distinct ligand-dependent and independent modes of thyroid hormone
   receptor (TR)/PGC-1 alpha interaction
SO JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
   coactivator (PGC-1 alpha) interactions are required for T(3)-dependent
   transcriptional responses involved in adaptive thermogenesis and liver.
   Thus, it is important to define TR/PGC-1 alpha contact modes and to
   understand their significance in gene expression. Previous studies have
   shown that TR beta 1 recruits PGC-1 alpha to target promoters via
   contacts between the hormone-dependent TR beta 1 activation function 2
   (AF-2) in the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) and a major PGC-1
   alpha nuclear receptor (NR) interaction box (consensus LxxLL) at amino
   acids 142-146. While our studies verify the existence and importance of
   this interaction, we present evidence that TR beta 1 also binds PGC-1
   alpha in a second ligand and LxxLL motif independent mode and show that
   this interaction requires the TR beta 1 N-terminal domain (NTD) and the
   PGC-1 alpha N-terminal activation domain (AD) at amino acids 1-130.
   Transfection assays suggest that optimal PGC-1 alpha coactivation
   requires the TR beta 1 NTD and that these contacts are needed for
   utilization of the PGC-1 alpha C-terminal AD, which does not bind TR and
   is implicated in basal transcription machinery contacts. We propose that
   TR AF-1/PGC-1 alpha contacts are needed for transition between
   activities of PGC-1 alpha N-and C-terminal ADs in gene expression. Our
   findings provide insights into possible roles for TR and NR AF-1 in gene
   expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Geometric Constraint and Mobility Variation of Two 3S(v)PS(v)
   Metamorphic Parallel Mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
AB This paper presents a unique feature of geometric constraint of adjacent
   axes of the variable-axis (vA) joint and analyses the effectiveness in
   the constructed limb, resulting in variation of mobility configuration
   of two 3S(v)PS(v) metamorphic parallel mechanisms. The underlying
   principle of the metamorphosis of this vA joint is unravelled by
   investigating the dependence of the corresponding screw system
   comprising of line vectors, leading to evolution of the vA joint from
   the source phase S(v) to the variable Hooke's joint phase U(v) and the
   variable revolute-joint phase R(v). The kinematic chain installed with
   the vA joint forms a reconfigurable limb and is then used to construct
   two 3S(v)PS(v) metamorphic parallel mechanisms proposed in this paper.
   The phase change of the vA joints incurs the constraint change of the
   S(v)PS(v) limb and subsequently results in the change of mobility
   configuration of the metamorphic parallel mechanisms. The paper further
   addresses the geometrical condition for constructing 3S(v)PS(v)
   metamorphic parallel mechanisms following the constraints delivered by
   the reconfigurable limbs, leading to the analysis of mobility change of
   the mechanisms induced by the phase change of the limbs. [DOI:

TI Studies on the mechanisms that affect the growth and development rates
   of Leptodactylus melanonotus tadpoles (Anura: Leptodactylidae) at
   different population densities
SO SALAMANDRA
AB The influence of population density on the growth and development of
   Leptodactylus melanonotus tadpoles was studied in field and laboratory
   experiments with ad libitum feeding. The differences in growth and
   development rates were far greater between the different density groups
   than between the groups of equal density but at different water quality.
   An increasing pollution of the water with nitrogen compounds corresponds
   to higher development rates, but the nitrogen content did not influence
   tadpole growth rate up to the moment when the first tadpole reached
   metamorphosis stage. Generally, in freshwater as well as in the flowing
   polluted water treatment, the ammonium content was low, while the
   nitrite and nitrate contents increased. In contrast, the two nitrogen
   acid radicals remained low in stagnant polluted water treatments with
   low oxygen content. When all tadpole groups were exposed to identical
   water in flowing-water experiments, the individually housed tadpoles
   reached growth rates that were more than three times higher than in all
   the tadpoles in groups. Therefore, such remarkable growth delay in
   groups must be caused by other factors than natural pollution of the
   water by tadpole faeces, and natural pollution may be ruled out as the
   dominant factor for explaining the growth and development patterns.
   Between siblings that were reared together in the beginning, but
   separated into groups of larger and smaller tadpoles later, the first
   ones doubled their total mass within 19 days of observation while the
   smaller ones increased their mass by a factor of six and produced about
   four times more nitrate and nitrite. Tadpoles that were kept
   individually in small mirror-walled containers responded to the visual
   stimuli of their own mirror images with more movement than those that
   were reared in non-mirroring, sand-coated containers. In confined
   conditions, visual stimuli of virtual tadpoles seen in mirrors tend to
   have similar effects as physically present tadpoles. The generally weak
   response to their mirror images in larger containers can be regarded as
   tolerance to conspecifics in tadpoles of schooling species like L.
   melanonotus. Nevertheless, their motoric activity increases much more by
   the physical presence of other tadpoles than by their virtual mirror
   images due to the real mutual disturbances. Individually housed tadpoles
   in sand-coated containers spent much more time resting on the bottom and
   grew and developed best. Disturbance reduces the time available for
   resting and digestion, and increases energy expenditure for movement.
   With the latter being directly linked to population density, this could
   be the dominant influence on tadpole development.

TI Development of multivariate NTCP models for radiation-induced
   hypothyroidism: a comparative analysis
SO RADIATION ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Hypothyroidism is a frequent late side effect of radiation
   therapy of the cervical region. Purpose of this work is to develop
   multivariate normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for
   radiation-induced hypothyroidism (RHT) and to compare them with already
   existing NTCP models for RHT.
   Methods: Fifty-three patients treated with sequential chemo-radiotherapy
   for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) were retrospectively reviewed for RHT
   events. Clinical information along with thyroid gland dose distribution
   parameters were collected and their correlation to RHT was analyzed by
   Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Rs). Multivariate logistic
   regression method using resampling methods (bootstrapping) was applied
   to select model order and parameters for NTCP modeling. Model
   performance was evaluated through the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC). Models were tested against external
   published data on RHT and compared with other published NTCP models.
   Results: If we express the thyroid volume exceeding X Gy as a percentage
   (V(x)(%)), a two-variable NTCP model including V(30)(%) and gender
   resulted to be the optimal predictive model for RHT (Rs = 0.615, p <
   0.001. AUC = 0.87). Conversely, if absolute thyroid volume exceeding X
   Gy (V(x)(cc)) was analyzed, an NTCP model based on 3 variables including
   V(30)(cc), thyroid gland volume and gender was selected as the most
   predictive model (Rs = 0.630, p < 0.001. AUC = 0.85). The three-variable
   model performs better when tested on an external cohort characterized by
   large inter-individuals variation in thyroid volumes (AUC = 0.914, 95%
   CI 0.760-0.984). A comparable performance was found between our model
   and that proposed in the literature based on thyroid gland mean dose and
   volume (p = 0.264).
   Conclusions: The absolute volume of thyroid gland exceeding 30 Gy in
   combination with thyroid gland volume and gender provide an NTCP model
   for RHT with improved prediction capability not only within our patient
   population but also in an external cohort.

TI Bacterial community composition associated with chironomid egg masses
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
AB Chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) are the most widely distributed and
   often the most abundant insect in freshwater. They undergo a complete
   metamorphosis of four life stages, of which the egg, larva, and pupae
   are aquatic and the adult is terrestrial. Chironomid egg masses were
   found to be natural reservoirs of Vibrio cholerae and Aeromonas species.
   To expand the knowledge of the endogenous bacterial community associated
   with chironomid egg masses, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and
   clone analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries were used in this study.
   Bacterial community composition associated with chironomid egg masses
   was found to be stable among different sampling periods. Cloned
   libraries of egg masses revealed that about 40% of the clones were
   related to bacteria known to degrade various toxicants. These findings
   were further supported when bacterial species that showed resistance to
   different toxic metals were isolated from egg masses and larval samples.
   Chironomids are found under a wide range of water conditions and are
   able to survive pollutants. However, little is known about their
   protective mechanisms under these conditions. Chironomid egg masses are
   inhabited by a stable endogenous bacterial community, which may
   potentially play a role in protecting chironomids from toxicants in
   polluted environments. Further study is needed to support this
   hypothesis.

TI Induction of DNA Demethylation Depending on Two Sets of Sox2 and
   Adjacent Oct3/4 Binding Sites (Sox-Oct Motifs) within the Mouse
   H19/Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (Igf2) Imprinted Control Region
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB DNA demethylation is used to establish and maintain an unmethylated
   state. The molecular mechanisms to induce DNA demethylation at a
   particular genomic locus remain unclear. The mouse H19/insulin-like
   growth factor 2 (Igf2) imprinted control region (ICR) is a methylation
   state-sensitive insulator that regulates transcriptional activation of
   both genes. The unmethylated state of the ICR established in female germ
   cells is maintained during development, resisting the wave of
   genome-wide de novo methylation. We previously demonstrated that a DNA
   fragment (fragment b) derived from this ICR-induced DNA demethylation
   when it was transfected into undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma
   cell lines. Moreover, two octamer motifs within fragment b were
   necessary to induce this DNA demethylation. Here, we demonstrated that
   both octamer motifs and their flanking sequences constitute Sox-Oct
   motifs (SO1 and SO2) and that the SO1 region, which requires at least
   four additional elements, including the SO2 region, contributes
   significantly to the induction of high-frequency DNA demethylation as a
   Sox-Oct motif. Moreover, RNAi-mediated inhibition of Oct3/4 expression
   in P19 cells resulted in a reduced DNA demethylation frequency of
   fragment b but not of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene CpG
   island. The Sox motif of SO1 could function as a sensor for a
   hypermethylated state of the ICR to repress demethylation activity.
   These results indicate that Sox-Oct motifs in the ICR determine the cell
   type, DNA region, and allele specificity of DNA demethylation. We
   propose a link between the mechanisms for maintenance of the
   unmethylated state of the H19/Igf2 ICR and the undifferentiated
   cell-specific induction of DNA demethylation.

TI Antidepressant-like effects of the extract from Cimicifuga foetida L.
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cimicifuga foetida L., a traditional
   Chinese medicine, has been developed for the treatment of perimenopausal
   symptoms including depression in China (Brand name: XIMINGTING (R),
   XMT). The primary active constituents are believed to be the triterpene
   glycosides. Nevertheless, there are no studies about the
   antidepressant-like effects of XMT in rodents.
   Aims of the study: The present study aimed to evaluate
   antidepressant-like effects of XMT.
   Materials and methods: Antidepressant-like activity of XMT was studied
   using forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) in
   female mice, as well as chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure in female
   rats. In addition, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head-twitch test
   and yohimbine toxicity potentiation test in female mice were conducted
   to propose the possible serotonergic or noradrenergic mechanisms in the
   antidepressant-like effects of XMT. In mice, XMT was administrated
   acutely and for 7 consecutive days (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day, p.o.); and
   in rats for 28 consecutive days (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, p.o.).
   Results: XMT significantly reduced immobility duration in FST and TST
   without affecting locomotor activity, increased swimming and climbing
   durations in FST, and enhanced 5-HTP-induced head-twitch response while
   did not affect yohimbine-induced lethality in female mice. XMT also
   normalized the inhibition of sucrose intake and decreased the levels of
   plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum corticosterone and adrenal
   gland weight in CMS-treated female rats.
   Conclusions: These data indicate XMT processes antidepressant-like
   properties in rodents, which could be related to its serotonergic and
   noradrenergic activation and normalization of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

TI Trans-tail regulation of MLL4-catalyzed H3K4 methylation by H4R3
   symmetric dimethylation is mediated by a tandem PHD of MLL4
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB Mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4; also called MLL2 and ALR) enzymatically
   generates trimethylated histone H3 Lys 4 (H3K4me3), a hallmark of gene
   activation. However, how MLL4-deposited H3K4me3 interplays with other
   histone marks in epigenetic processes remains largely unknown. Here, we
   show that MLL4 plays an essential role in differentiating NT2/D1 stem
   cells by activating differentiation-specific genes. A tandem plant
   homeodomain (PHD(4-6)) of MLL4 recognizes unmethylated or asymmetrically
   dimethylated histone H4 Arg 3 (H4R3me0 or H4R3me2a) and is required for
   MLL4's nucleosomal methyltransferase activity and MLL4-mediated
   differentiation. Kabuki syndrome mutations in PHD(4-6) reduce PHD(4-6)'s
   binding ability and MLL4's catalytic activity. PHD(4-6)'s binding
   strength is inhibited by H4R3 symmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2s), a
   gene-repressive mark. The protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7),
   but not PRMT5, represses MLL4 target genes by up-regulating H4R3me2s
   levels and antagonizes MLL4-mediated differentiation. Consistently,
   PRMT7 knockdown increases MLL4-catalyzed H3K4me3 levels. During
   differentiation, decreased H4R3me2s levels are associated with increased
   H3K4me3 levels at a cohort of genes, including many HOXA and HOXB genes.
   These findings indicate that the trans-tail inhibition of MLL4-generated
   H3K4me3 by PRMT7-regulated H4R3me2s may result from H4R3me2s's
   interference with PHD(4-6)'s binding activity and is a novel epigenetic
   mechanism that underlies opposing effects of MLL4 and PRMT7 on cellular
   differentiation.

TI Isolation and nucleotide sequence analysis of the of Rhinella arenarum
   beta-catenin: An mRNA and protein expression study during the larval
   stages of the digestive tract development
SO GENE
AB beta-catenin interacts with several proteins mediating key biological
   processes, such as cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion as well as
   signal transduction. This work was done to establish the molecular basis
   and regulation of the formation pattern of
   cadherin/beta-catenin-mediated adherens junctions, using an animal model
   of unknown gene sequence, the toad Rhinella arenarum. A Rhinella
   arenarum beta-catenin homolog was isolated from larval tissue, their
   sequence compared and analyzed with those of eight other vertebrates
   using bioinformatics tools. The mRNA and protein expression levels of
   beta-catenin were determined during the development of Rhinella arenarum
   digestive tract both by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
   (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry-morphometry respectively.
   Using Xenopus laevis frog specific primers, a fragment 539 bp of
   Rhinella arenarum toad beta-catenin cDNA was obtained and sequenced. The
   resulting putative sequence of 177 amino acids showed high similarity at
   the amino acid level (97%) when compared to other six vertebrates
   (Xenopus laevis, Xenopus tropicalis, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus,
   Bos taurus and Homo sapiens), with sequences and structural domains
   characteristic of catenins. Subsequently, using primers specifically
   designed for Rhinella arenarum nucleotide sequence, beta-catenin-mRNA
   increasing levels were found during the Rhinella arenarum metamorphosis.
   Finally, increasing beta-catenin protein expression during development
   has confirmed the specificity the detection of Rhinella arenarum
   beta-catenin.
   Summarizing, we have isolated and sequenced a beta-catenin-homologue
   sequence from the Rhinella arenarum toad, which is highly conserved
   between species, and following we have detected beta-catenin mRNA and
   protein levels during their digestive tract development. (C) 2012

TI Genotoxic effects of copper oxide nanoparticles in Neuro 2A cell
   cultures
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are used for their biocide
   potential however they were also shown to be highly toxic to mammalian
   cells. Therefore, the effects of CuO NPs should be carefully
   investigated to determine the most sensitive processes for CuO NP
   toxicity. In this study, the genotoxicity of CuO NPs was investigated in
   vitro, using the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2A Genotoxic
   effects related to DNA fragmentation, DNA methylation and chromosomal
   damage, as well as lipid peroxidation, were investigated and compared to
   cytotoxic effects, measured by the mitochondria! reduction of
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide into
   formazan. Based on mitochondrial activity, CuO NPs were found to be
   cytotoxic At the highest concentration tested (400 mg l(-1)), 63% of
   cell viability was found in Neuro-2A cells after 24 h of treatment to
   CuO NPs. CuO NPs were also found to induce DNA fragmentation, lipid
   peroxidation and micronucleus formation. The micronucleus assay was the
   most sensitive to evaluate CuO NP genotoxicity and micronucleus
   frequency was increased significantly at 12.5 mg l(-1) CuO NPs after 24
   h of treatment. At this concentration, no significant change of cell
   viability was found using the mitochondrial activity assay. These
   results highlight the important risk of genotoxic effects of CuO NPs and
   show that genotoxicity assays are a sensitive approach to evaluate the
   risk of CuO NP toxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI BAF60 A, B, and Cs of muscle determination and renewal
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB Developmental biologists have defined many of the diffusible and
   transcription factors that control muscle differentiation, yet we still
   have only rudimentary knowledge of the mechanisms that dictate whether a
   myogenic progenitor cell forms muscle versus alternate lineages,
   including those that can be pathological in a state of disease or
   degeneration. Clues about the molecular basis for lineage determination
   in muscle progenitors are only now emerging from studies of chromatin
   modifications that avail myogenic genes for transcription, together with
   analysis of the composition and activities of the chromatin-modifying
   complexes themselves. Here we review recent progress on muscle
   determination and explore a unifying theme that environmental cues from
   the stem or progenitor niche control the selection of specific subunit
   variants of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF)
   chromatin-modifying complex, creating a combinatorial code that dictates
   whether cells adopt myogenic versus nonmyogenic cell fates. A key
   component of the code appears to be the mutually exclusive usage of the
   a, b, and c variants of the 60-kD structural subunit BAF60
   (BRG1/BRM-associated factor 60), of which BAF60c is essential to
   activate both skeletal and cardiac muscle programs. Since chromatin
   remodeling governs myogenic fate, the combinatorial assembly of the
   SWI/SNF complex might be targeted to develop drugs aimed at the
   therapeutic reduction of compensatory fibrosis and fatty deposition in
   chronic muscular disorders.

TI Histone H1 compacts DNA under force and during chromatin assembly
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB Histone H1 binds to linker DNA between nucleosomes, but the dynamics and
   biological ramifications of this interaction remain poorly understood.
   We performed single-molecule experiments using magnetic tweezers to
   determine the effects of H1 on naked DNA in buffer or during chromatin
   assembly in Xenopus egg extracts. In buffer, nanomolar concentrations of
   H1 induce bending and looping of naked DNA at stretching forces below
   0.6 pN, effects that can be reversed with 2.7-pN force or in 200 mM
   monovalent salt concentrations. Consecutive tens-of-nanometer bending
   events suggest that H1 binds to naked DNA in buffer at high
   stoichiometries. In egg extracts, single DNA molecules assemble into
   nucleosomes and undergo rapid compaction. Histone H1 at endogenous
   physiological concentrations increases the DNA compaction rate during
   chromatin assembly under 2-pN force and decreases it during disassembly
   under 5-pN force. In egg cytoplasm, histone H1 protects sperm nuclei
   undergoing genome-wide decondensation and chromatin assembly from
   becoming abnormally stretched or fragmented due to astral microtubule
   pulling forces. These results reveal functional ramifications of H1
   binding to DNA at the single-molecule level and suggest an important
   physiological role for H1 in compacting DNA under force and during
   chromatin assembly.

TI The Involvement of Acidic Nucleoplasmic DNA-binding Protein (And-1) in
   the Regulation of Prereplicative Complex (pre-RC) Assembly in Human
   Cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB DNA replication in all eukaryotes starts with the process of loading the
   replicative helicase MCM2-7 onto chromatin during late mitosis of the
   cell cycle. MCM2-7 is a key component of the prereplicative complex
   (pre-RC), which is loaded onto chromatin by the concerted action of
   origin recognition complex, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Here, we demonstrate that
   And-1 is assembled onto chromatin in late mitosis and early G(1) phase
   before the assembly of pre-RC in human cells. And-1 forms complexes with
   MCM2-7 to facilitate the assembly of MCM2-7 onto chromatin at
   replication origins in late mitosis and G(1) phase. We also present data
   to show that depletion of And-1 significantly reduces the interaction
   between Cdt1 and MCM7 in G(1) phase cells. Thus, human And-1 facilitates
   loading of the MCM2-7 helicase onto chromatin during the assembly of
   pre-RC.

TI Reversal of chronic stress-induced pain by transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS) in an animal model
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a
   therapeutic tool for pain syndromes. Although initial results in human
   subjects are encouraging, it still remains unclear whether the effects
   of tDCS can reverse maladaptive plasticity associated with chronic pain.
   To investigate this question, we tested whether tDCS can reverse the
   specific behavioral effects of chronic stress in the pain system, and
   also those indexed by corticosterone and interleukin-1 beta levels in
   serum and TNF alpha levels in the hippocampus, in a well-controlled rat
   model of chronic restraint stress (CRS). Forty-one adult male Wistar
   rats were divided into two groups control and stress. The stress group
   was exposed to CRS for 11 weeks for the establishment of hyperalgesia
   and mechanical allodynia as shown by the hot plate and von Frey tests,
   respectively. Rats were then divided into four groups control, stress,
   stress+sham tDCS and stress+tDCS. Anodal or sham tDCS was applied for 20
   min/day over 8 days and the tests were repeated. Then, the animals were
   killed, blood collected and hippocampus removed for ELISA testing. This
   model of CRS proved effective to induce chronic pain, as the animals
   exhibited hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The hot plate test
   showed an analgesic effect, and the von Frey test, an anti-allodynic
   effect after the last tDCS session, and there was a significant decrease
   in hippocampal TNF alpha levels. These results support the notion that
   tDCS reverses the detrimental effects of chronic stress on the pain
   system and decreases TNF alpha levels in the hippocampus. (c) 2012

TI Genetic and epigenetic variants influencing the development of
   nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common worldwide. The
   importance of genetic and epigenetic changes in etiology and
   pathogenesis of NAFLD has been increasingly recognized. However, the
   exact mechanism is largely unknown. A large number of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) related to NAFLD has been documented by candidate
   gene studies (CGSs). Among these genes, peroxisome
   pro-liferatoractivated receptor-gamma, adiponectin, leptin and tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha were frequently reported. Since the introduction
   of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), there have been significant
   advances in our understanding of genomic variations of NAFLD.
   Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing family member A3 (PNPLA3,
   SNP rs738409, encoding I148M), also termed adiponutrin, has caught most
   attention. The evidence that PNPLA3 is associated with increased hepatic
   fat levels and hepatic inflammation has been validated by a series of
   studies. Epigenetic modification refers to phenotypic changes caused by
   an adaptive mechanism unrelated to alteration of primary DNA sequences.
   Epigenetic regulation mainly includes microRNAs (miRs), DNA methylation,
   histone modifications and ubiquitination, among which miRs are studied
   most extensively. miRs are small natural single stranded RNA molecules
   regulating mRNA degradation or translation inhibition, subsequently
   altering protein expression of target genes. The miR-122, a highly
   abundant miR accounting for nearly 70% of all miRs in the liver, is
   significantly under-expressed in NAFLD subjects. Inhibition of miR-122
   with an antisense oligonucleotide results in decreased mRNA expression
   of lipogenic genes and improvement of liver steatosis. The investigation
   into epigenetic involvement in NAFLD pathogenesis is just at the
   beginning and needs to be refined. This review summarizes the roles of
   genetics and epigenetics in the development of NAFLD. The progress made
   in this field may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic
   targets for NAFLD management. (C) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI Protocol: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) methodology to
   investigate histone modifications in two model diatom species
SO PLANT METHODS
AB In this report we describe a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
   protocol for two fully sequenced model diatom species Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana. This protocol allows the
   extraction of satisfactory amounts of chromatin and gives reproducible
   results. We coupled the ChIP assay with real time quantitative PCR. Our
   results reveal that the two major histone marks H3K4me2 and H3K9me2
   exist in P. tricornutum and T. pseudonana. As in other eukaryotes,
   H3K4me2 marks active genes whereas H3K9me2 marks transcriptionally
   inactive transposable elements. Unexpectedly however, T. pseudonana
   housekeeping genes also show a relative enrichment of H3K9me2. We also
   discuss optimization of the procedure, including growth conditions,
   cross linking and sonication. Validation of the protocol provides a set
   of genes and transposable elements that can be used as controls for
   studies using ChIP in each diatom species. This protocol can be easily
   adapted to other diatoms and eukaryotic phytoplankton species for
   genetic and biochemical studies.

TI Piperine potentiates the protective effects of curcumin against chronic
   unpredictable stress-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative damage
   in mice
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Life event stressors are the major vulnerability factors for the
   development of cognitive disorders. A vital therapeutic for stress
   related disorders is curcumin, derived from curry spice turmeric.
   Dietary phytochemicals are currently used as an adjuvant therapy to
   accelerate their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the present study was
   designed to investigate the effect of curcumin and its co-administration
   with piperine against chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced
   cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in mice. Male Laca mice were
   subjected to undergo a battery of stressors for a period of 28 days.
   Vehicle/drugs were administered daily 30 mins before CUS procedure.
   Chronic stress significantly impaired memory performance (delayed
   latency time to reach platform in Morris water maze as well as to reach
   closed arm in elevated plus maze test) and decreased locomotor activity
   along with sucrose consumption. Further, there was a significant
   impairment in oxidative parameters (elevated malondialdehyde, nitrite
   concentration and decreased reduced glutathione, catalase levels) and
   mitochondrial enzyme complex activities, along with raised
   acetylcholinesterase and serum corticosterone levels. Chronic treatment
   with curcumin (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly improved these
   behavioral and biochemical alterations, restored mitochondrial enzyme
   complex activities and attenuated increased acetylcholinesterase and
   serum corticosterone levels. In addition, co-administration of piperine
   (20 mg/kg; p.o.) with curcumin (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly
   elevated the protective effect as compared to their effects alone. The
   results clearly suggest that piperine enhanced the bioavailability of
   curcumin and potentiated its protective effects against CUS induced
   cognitive impairment and associated oxidative damage in mice. (C) 2012

TI Postnatal exposure to trichloroethylene alters glutathione redox
   homeostasis, methylation potential, and neurotrophin expression in the
   mouse hippocampus
SO NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB Previous studies have shown that continuous exposure throughout
   gestation until the juvenile period to environmentally relevant doses of
   trichloroethylene (ICE) in the drinking water of MRL+/+ mice promoted
   adverse behavior associated with glutathione depletion in the cerebellum
   indicating increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The purpose of
   this study was to extend our findings and further characterize the
   impact of TCE exposure on redox homeostasis and biomarkers of oxidative
   stress in the hippocampus, a brain region prone to oxidative stress.
   Instead of a continuous exposure, the mice were exposed to water only or
   two environmentally relevant doses of TCE in the drinking water
   postnatally from birth until 6 weeks of age. Biomarkers of plasma
   metabolites in the transsulfuration pathway and the transmethylation
   pathway of the methionine cycle were also examined. Gene expression of
   neurotrophins was examined to investigate a possible relationship
   between oxidative stress, redox imbalance and neurotrophic factor
   expression with TCE exposure. Our results show that hippocampi isolated
   from male mice exposed to TCE showed altered glutathione redox
   homeostasis indicating a more oxidized state. Also observed was a
   significant, dose dependent increase in glutathione precursors. Plasma
   from the TCE treated mice showed alterations in metabolites in the
   transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways indicating redox
   imbalance and altered methylation capacity. 3-Nitrotyrosine, a biomarker
   of protein oxidative stress, was also significantly higher in plasma and
   hippocampus of TCE-exposed mice compared to controls. In contrast,
   expression of key neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus (BDNF, NGF,
   and NT-3) was significantly reduced compared to controls. Our results
   demonstrate that low-level postnatal and early life ICE exposure
   modulates neurotrophin gene expression in the mouse hippocampus and may
   provide a mechanism for TCE-mediated neurotoxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI The amphibian chytrid fungus in Bavarian populations of Alytes
   obstetricans: past absence, current presence, and metamorph mortality
SO AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA
AB In three Bavarian populations of Alytes obstetricans that were studied
   for the occurrence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the pathogen was
   detected. This is the first account of chytridiomycosis in Bavaria,
   Germany. Infected tadpoles had low infection loads mostly of 10(1) to
   10(2) genome equivalents. Under high-density rearing conditions in the
   laboratory mortality rates were high after metamorphosis. Some
   individuals, however, showed no infection with Bd, while others survived
   metamorphosis in spite of low Bd loads. A new approach was chosen to get
   historical data on Bd occurrence in one of these populations:
   skeletochronological phalanx cross sections of 248 individuals that had
   been collected in the late 1980s were used to analyse the epidermis for
   chytrid sporangia. No sporangia were detected, thus we conclude that
   this population was not affected by Bd in the past.

TI Degradation products of lignocellulosics in pulp mill effluents -
   comparison and evaluation of different gas chromatographic techniques
   for a comprehensive analysis
SO HOLZFORSCHUNG
AB Pulp mill effluents contain potentially valuable compounds and will gain
   even greater importance than today in future biorefinery scenarios as
   possible resources. Analysis of effluents of process streams is not
   straightforward because of the vast variety of substances embedded in
   the complex inorganic matrix of high concentration. In the present
   comparative investigation, different combinations of gas chromatography
   (GC) and derivatisation techniques were tested and critically evaluated
   aiming at a comprehensive description of all major compound classes
   (low-molecular weight and long-chain carboxylic acids, lignin fragments,
   carbohydrates and aldehydes). As derivatisation techniques,
   trimethylsilylation, (trimethyl silyl) methylation and methylation were
   applied. In addition, the effluents were analysed by pyrolysis-GC/mass
   spectrometry (MS), either directly or with simultaneous methylation. The
   study provides comprehensive information on the composition of
   effluents, the suitability of the various combinations of derivatisation
   and GC/MS techniques. The discrimination effects of the different
   approaches are compared. The comprehensive analytical approach led to a
   coherent balance in terms of the contribution of the major portion of
   organic compounds to the total organic carbon (TOC) content in pulp mill
   effluents.

TI Targeted manipulation of heterochromatin rescues MeCP2 Rett mutants and
   re-establishes higher order chromatin organization
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Heterochromatic regions represent a significant portion of the mammalian
   genome and have been implied in several important cellular processes,
   including cell division and genomic stability. However, its composition
   and dynamics remain largely unknown. To better understand how
   heterochromatin functions and how it is organized within the context of
   the cell nucleus, we have developed molecular tools allowing the
   targeting of virtually any nuclear factor specifically to
   heterochromatic regions and, thereby, the manipulation, also in a
   temporally controlled manner, of its composition. To validate our
   approach, we have ectopically targeted MeCP2 chromatin binding deficient
   Rett mutants to constitutive heterochromatic regions and analyze its
   functional consequences. We could show that, once bound to their
   endogenous target regions, their ability to re-organize higher order
   chromatin structure is restored. Furthermore, a temporally controlled
   targeting strategy allowed us to monitor MeCP2-mediated chromatin
   rearrangements in vivo and to visualize large-scale chromatin movements
   over several micrometers, as well as heterochromatic foci fusion events.
   This novel strategy enables specific tethering of any protein to
   heterochromatin and lays the ground for controlled manipulation of its
   composition and organization.

TI Transcription in the maintenance of centromere chromatin identity
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Recent evidence has shown that transcription is permissible through the
   purportedly repressive centromere domain, and that this transcriptional
   activity is of functional consequence. The best-studied example is
   transcription of the pericentric DNA repeats in the generation of siRNAs
   required for pericentric heterochromatin assembly in yeast. However,
   non-siRNA transcripts emanating from both pericentric and centromere
   core domains have also been detected in a cell cycle and cellular
   differentiation-dependent manner. Elevated levels of centromeric
   transcripts have also been detected in some cancers; however, it is
   still unclear how high levels of centromere transcripts may contribute
   towards disease progression. More recent studies have demonstrated that
   careful regulation of the histone modifications and transcription level
   at the centromere is vital for the recruitment of key centromere
   proteins and assembly of CENP-A domain. Here, we compare the
   transcriptional dynamics and function of various transcripts derived
   from pericentromeric and centromere core regions. We also propose a
   model in which the chromatin remodelling activity of transcription, and
   the resultant transcripts, contribute synergistically to perpetuate
   centromere chromatin identity.

TI The characteristics of the expression of heat shock proteins and cox-2
   in the liver of hamsters infected with Clonorchis sinensis, and the
   change of endocrine hormones and cytokines
SO FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA
AB The liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis (Digenea) is a high-risk parasite
   that causes serious diseases such as cirrhosis, carcinogenic liver
   damage and clonorchiasis in East Asia. This study was conducted to
   evaluate the relationship between stress/endocrine hormones and
   inflammation induced by infection as well as the expression of heat
   shock proteins (hsp-27, hsp-90), cox-2 and cytokines in the livers of
   hamsters infected with C. sinensis. The average body weight of infected
   hamsters decreased up to 25% compared with that of the control group,
   and bile duct hyperplasia with inflammation, liver fibrosis and hepatic
   necrosis were observed in C. sinensis-infected livers. The expression of
   hsp-27, hsp-90, and cox-2 was significantly increased in the livers of
   C. sinensis-infected hamsters compared with the control group. Moreover,
   the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2,
   TGF-beta 2 and IFN-alpha 1) were markedly increased in the livers of the
   infected group compared with those of the control group. Consistently,
   plasma IL-3 and IL-6 levels gradually increased during the infection
   period, and the concentration levels of testosterone, luteinizing
   hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), corticosterone, and
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in C. sinensis-infected hamsters
   increased over 25%, compared with those of the uninfected normal group.
   These results demonstrate that C. sinensis infection may increase the
   expression of hsp27, hsp90 and cox-2 as well as it may cause periductal
   fibrosis, chronic inflammation and hepatic necrosis in the liver.
   Furthermore, the results indicate that C. sinensis infection induces not
   only stress-induced hormone imbalance but also the sustained secretion
   of inflammatory cytokines through chronic stress/stimuli.

TI Forestry Influence by Stump Harvest and Site Preparation on
   Methylmercury, Total Mercury and Other Stream Water Chemistry Parameters
   Across a Boreal Landscape
SO ECOSYSTEMS
AB Forestry has been reported to cause elevated mercury (Hg) concentrations
   in runoff water. However, the degree to which forestry operations
   influence Hg in runoff varies among sites. A synoptic study, covering 54
   catchments distributed all over Sweden, subjected to either stump
   harvest (SH), site preparation (SP) or no treatment (Ref), was
   undertaken to reveal the degree of forestry impact and causes of
   eventual variation. All streams were sampled twice, in autumn 2009 and
   summer 2010. There were no significant differences in total mercury
   (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations between the three
   treatments in either 2009 or 2010. However, when pooling the treated
   catchments (that is, SH and SP) and taking catchment properties such as
   latitude into account, the treatment had a significant influence on the
   THg and MeHg concentrations. Although the treatment effect on THg and
   MeHg did not differ between SH and SP, the study did reveal significant
   forestry effects on potassium (K) and total nitrogen (TN) that were
   greater in the SH catchments and lower in the SP catchments. Partial
   least square (PLS) regressions indicated that organic matter was the
   most important variable influencing both the THg and MeHg
   concentrations. There were no significant differences between the
   treatment groups when comparing the ratios of THg/total organic carbon
   (TOC) and MeHg/TOC, suggesting that the high concentrations of THg and
   MeHg observed at some of the treated catchments are associated with
   increased concentrations of TOC rather than new methylation or increased
   mobilization caused by factors other than TOC.

TI Genome-wide mapping of methylated adenine residues in pathogenic

SO NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing allows the systematic
   detection of chemical modifications such as methylation but has not
   previously been applied on a genome-wide scale. We used this approach to
   detect 49,311 putative 6-methyladenine (m6A) residues and 1,407 putative
   5-methylcytosine (m5C) residues in the genome of a pathogenic
   Escherichia coli strain. We obtained strand-specific information for
   methylation sites and a quantitative assessment of the frequency of
   methylation at each modified position. We deduced the sequence motifs
   recognized by the methyltransferase enzymes present in this strain
   without prior knowledge of their specificity. Furthermore, we found that
   deletion of a phage-encoded methyltransferase-endonuclease
   (restriction-modification; RM) system induced global transcriptional
   changes and led to gene amplification, suggesting that the role of RM
   systems extends beyond protecting host genomes from foreign DNA.

TI Do researchers impact their study populations? Assessing the effect of
   field procedures in a long term population monitoring of sea kraits
SO AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA
AB Long term population monitoring is essential to ecological studies;
   however, field procedures may disturb individuals. Assessing this topic
   is important in worldwide declining taxa such as reptiles. Previous
   studies focussed on animal welfare issues and examined short-term
   effects (e.g. increase of stress hormones due to handling). Long-term
   effects with possible consequences at the population level remain poorly
   investigated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of widely
   used field procedures (e.g. handling, marking, forced regurgitation)
   both on short-term (hormonal stress response) and on long-term (changes
   in body condition, survival) scales in two intensively monitored
   populations of sea kraits (Laticauda spp.) in New Caledonia. Focusing on
   the most intensively monitored sites, from 2002 to 2012, we gathered
   approximately 11 200 captures/recaptures on 4500 individuals. Each snake
   was individually marked (scale clipping + branding) and subjected to
   various measurements (e.g. body size, head morphology, palpation). In
   addition, a subsample of more than 500 snakes was forced to regurgitate
   their prey for dietary analyses. Handling caused a significant stress
   hormonal response, however we found no detrimental long-term effect on
   body condition. Forced regurgitation did not cause any significant
   effect on both body condition one year later and survival. These results
   suggest that the strong short-term stress provoked by field procedures
   did not translate into negative effects on the population. Although
   similar analyses are required to test the validity of our conclusions in
   other species, our results suggest distinguishing welfare and population
   issues to evaluate the potential impact of population surveys.

   (THR) beta mRNA levels induced by cold. Administration of T3 to
   rosiglitazone-treated rats exacerbated the cold-induced increase in
   energy expenditure but did not restore a proper activation of D2 and
   PGC-1 alpha, nor further increased uncoupling protein 1 expression.
   Regarding adrenergic signaling, rosiglitazone did not affect the changes
   in BAT cAMP content and PKA activity induced by cold. Rosiglitazone
   alone or in combination with cold increased CREB binding to DNA, but it
   markedly reduced the expression of one of its major coactivators, CREB
   binding protein. In conclusion, pharmacological PPAR gamma activation
   impairs short-term cold elicitation of BAT adrenergic and thyroid
   signaling, which may result in abnormal tissue recruitment and
   thermogenic activity.

TI A Polycomb Group Protein Is Retained at Specific Sites on Chromatin in
   Mitosis
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including by Polycomb Group
   (PcG) proteins, may depend on heritable chromatin states, but how these
   states can be propagated through mitosis is unclear. Using
   immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation, we find PcG proteins
   associated with mitotic chromosomes in Drosophila S2 cells. Genome-wide
   sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP-SEQ) from mitotic
   cells indicates that Posterior Sex Combs (PSC) is not present at
   well-characterized PcG targets including Hox genes in mitosis, but does
   remain at a subset of interphase sites. Many of these persistent sites
   overlap with chromatin domain borders described by Sexton et al. (2012),
   which are genomic regions characterized by low levels of long range
   contacts. Persistent PSC binding sites flank both Hox gene clusters. We
   hypothesize that disruption of long-range chromatin contacts in mitosis
   contributes to PcG protein release from most sites, while persistent
   binding at sites with minimal long-range contacts may nucleate
   re-establishment of PcG binding and chromosome organization after
   mitosis.

TI Both chronic treatments by epothilone D and fluoxetine increase the
   short-term memory and differentially alter the mood status of STOP/MAP6
   KO mice
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY
AB Recent evidence underlines the crucial role of neuronal cytoskeleton in
   the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases. In this line, the deletion
   of STOP/MAP6 (Stable Tubule Only Polypeptide), a microtubule-stabilizing
   protein, triggers various neurotransmission and behavioral defects,
   suggesting that STOP knockout (KO) mice could be a relevant experimental
   model for schizoaffective symptoms. To establish the predictive validity
   of such a mouse line, in which the brain serotonergic tone is
   dramatically imbalanced, the effects of a chronic fluoxetine treatment
   on the mood status of STOP KO mice were characterized. Moreover, we
   determined the impact, on mood, of a chronic treatment by epothilone D,
   a taxol-like microtubule-stabilizing compound that has previously been
   shown to improve the synaptic plasticity deficits of STOP KO mice. We
   demonstrated that chronic fluoxetine was either antidepressive and
   anxiolytic, or pro-depressive and anxiogenic, depending on the paradigm
   used to test treated mutant mice. Furthermore, control-treated STOP KO
   mice exhibited paradoxical behaviors, compared with their clear-cut
   basal mood status. Paradoxical fluoxetine effects and control-treated
   STOP KO behaviors could be because of their hyper-reactivity to acute
   and chronic stress. Interestingly, both epothilone D and fluoxetine
   chronic treatments improved the short-term memory of STOP KO mice. Such
   treatments did not affect the serotonin and norepinephrine transporter
   densities in cerebral areas of mice. Altogether, these data demonstrated
   that STOP KO mice could represent a useful model to study the
   relationship between cytoskeleton, mood, and stress, and to test
   innovative mood treatments, such as microtubule-stabilizing compounds.

TI AIRE-PHD fingers are structural hubs to maintain the integrity of
   chromatin-associated interactome
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Mutations in autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene cause autoimmune
   polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy. AIRE is expressed
   in thymic medullary epithelial cells, where it promotes the expression
   of peripheral-tissue antigens to mediate deletional tolerance, thereby
   preventing self-reactivity. AIRE contains two plant homeodomains (PHDs)
   which are sites of pathological mutations. AIRE-PHD fingers are
   important for AIRE transcriptional activity and presumably play a
   crucial role in the formation of multimeric protein complexes at
   chromatin level which ultimately control immunological tolerance. As a
   step forward the understanding of AIRE-PHD fingers in normal and
   pathological conditions, we investigated their structure and used a
   proteomic SILAC approach to assess the impact of patient mutations
   targeting AIRE-PHD fingers. Importantly, both AIRE-PHD fingers are
   structurally independent and mutually non-interacting domains. In
   contrast to D297A and V301M on AIRE-PHD1, the C446G mutation on
   AIRE-PHD2 destroys the structural fold, thus causing aberrant AIRE
   localization and reduction of AIRE target genes activation. Moreover,
   mutations targeting AIRE-PHD1 affect the formation of a multimeric
   protein complex at chromatin level.Overall our results reveal the
   importance of AIRE-PHD domains in the interaction with
   chromatin-associated nuclear partners and gene regulation confirming the
   role of PHD fingers as versatile protein interaction hubs for multiple
   binding events.

TI Epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of vinclozolin induced mouse
   adult onset disease and associated sperm epigenome biomarkers
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB The endocrine disruptor vinclozolin has previously been shown to promote
   epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease in the
   rat. The current study was designed to investigate the transgenerational
   actions of vinclozolin on the mouse. Transient exposure of the F0
   generation gestating female during gonadal sex determination promoted
   transgenerational adult onset disease in F3 generation male and female
   mice, including spermatogenic cell defects, testicular abnormalities,
   prostate abnormalities, kidney abnormalities and polycystic ovarian
   disease. Pathology analysis demonstrated 75% of the vinclozolin lineage
   animals developed disease with 34% having two or more different disease
   states. Interestingly, the vinclozolin induced transgenerational disease
   was observed in the outbred CD-1 strain, but not the inbred 129 mouse
   strain. Analysis of the F3 generation sperm epigenome identified
   differential DNA methylation regions that can potentially be utilized as
   epigenetic biomarkers for transgenerational exposure and disease. (C)

TI Fkbp52 heterozygosity alters behavioral, endocrine and neurogenetic
   parameters under basal and chronic stress conditions in mice
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Aversive life events represent one of the main risk factors for the
   development of many psychiatric diseases, but the interplay between
   environmental factors and genetic predispositions is still poorly
   understood. One major finding in many depressed patients is an impaired
   regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The
   negative feedback loop of the HPA axis is mediated via the
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor. The
   co-chaperones FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) and FK506-binding
   protein 52 (FKBP52) are components of the heat shock protein
   90-receptor-heterocomplex and are functionally divergent regulators of
   both receptors. Here, we characterized heterozygous Fkbp52 knockout
   (Fkbp52(+/-)) mice under basal or chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)
   conditions with regard to physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioral and
   mRNA expression alterations. Fkbp52(+/-) mice displayed symptoms of
   increased stress sensitivity in a subset of behavioral and
   neuroendocrine parameters. These included increased anxiety-related
   behavior in the elevated plusmaze and an enhanced neuroendocrine
   response to a forced swim test (FST), possibly mediated by reduced GR
   sensitivity. At the same time, Fkbp52(+/-) mice also demonstrated signs
   of stress resilience in other behavioral and neuroendocrine aspects,
   such as reduced basal corticosterone levels and more active
   stress-coping behavior in the FST following CSDS. These contrasting
   results are in line with previous reports showing that FKBP52 is not
   involved in all branches of GR signaling, but rather acts in a
   gene-specific manner to regulate GR transcriptional activation. (C) 2012

TI Persistent carry-over effects of planktonic exposure to ocean
   acidification in the Olympia oyster
SO ECOLOGY
AB Predicting impacts of global environmental change is challenging due to
   the complex life cycles that characterize many terrestrial and aquatic
   taxa. Different life stages often interact with the physical environment
   in distinct ways, and a growing body of work suggests that stresses
   experienced during one life stage can "carry over'' to influence
   subsequent stages. Assessments of population responses to environmental
   perturbation must therefore consider how effects might propagate across
   life-history transitions. We investigated consequences of ocean
   acidification (decreased pH and carbonate saturation) for early life
   stages of the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), a foundation species in
   estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America. We reared oysters at
   three levels of seawater pH, including a control (8.0) and two
   additional levels (7.9 and 7.8). Oysters were cultured through their
   planktonic larval period to metamorphosis and into early juvenile life.
   Larvae reared under pH 7.8 exhibited a 15% decrease in larval shell
   growth rate, and a 7% decrease in shell area at settlement, compared to
   larvae reared under control conditions. Impacts were even more
   pronounced a week after settlement, with juveniles that had been reared
   as larvae under reduced pH exhibiting a 41% decrease in shell growth
   rate. Importantly, the latter effect arose regardless of the pH level
   the oysters experienced as juveniles, indicating a strong carry-over
   effect from the larval phase. Adverse impacts of early exposure to low
   pH persisted for at least 1.5 months after juveniles were transferred to
   a common environment. Overall, our results suggest that a stringent
   focus on a single phase of the life cycle (e.g., one perceived as the
   "weakest link'') may neglect critical impacts that can be transferred
   across life stages in taxa with complex life histories.

SO JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY
AB We recorded the initial appearance of pigmentation on the blind side in
   olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, and investigated the
   morphological features of abnormal blind-side pigmentation in
   hypermelanic juveniles at the microscopic level. In addition, we
   examined the development of malpigmentation on the blind side of
   flounder during early development, from 24 to 94 days after hatching
   (d.a.h.). A total of 60 flounder were collected every 7 d and assessed
   for quantitative pattern changes in abnormal blind-side pigmentation.
   The primitive spot and the first patch were visible under a microscope
   and to the naked eye appeared at 38 d.a.h. (total length [TL] = 18.3 +/-
   0.4 mm, body weight [BW] = 57.6 +/- 4.1 mg) and 45 d.a.h. (TL = 28.1 +/-
   0.7 mm, BW = 213.0 +/- 14.9 mg), respectively, around the area between
   the anus and pelvic fin or caudal edge of the trunk. The malpigmented
   patch was composed of adult-type melanophores, xanthophores, and
   iridophores, indicating that it can reversely change its color according
   to background color, as that on the eyed side in both color and pattern.
   The pigmented patches subsequently became more distinctive and large in
   appearance and spread across the entire body on the blind side of the
   fish.

TI Protein and nucleic acid methylating enzymes: mechanisms and regulation
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB Protein and nucleic acid methylating enzymes are implicated in myriad
   cellular processes. These enzymes utilize diverse chemical mechanisms
   ranging from nucleophilic substitution-displacement to a novel
   radical-based reaction found in bacterial iron-sulfur cluster proteins.
   Within the cell, methylation activity is governed by interactions with
   endogenous molecular machinery. Of particular interest are the
   observations that methylating enzyme activity can be allosterically
   controlled by regulatory binding partners. Recent advances and emerging
   trends in the study of methylating enzyme mechanisms and regulation
   highlight the importance of protein and nucleic acid methylation in

TI Glutathione S-transferase M1, T1, and P1 polymorphisms and thyroid
   cancer risk: A meta-analysis
SO CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genetic variants have been explored
   extensively as a predictive factor for cancer etiology. This
   meta-analysis aimed to examine the associations GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1
   genetic polymorphisms with thyroid cancer risk. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
   Library, and HuGNet database were searched up to November 2011 using the
   appropriate terms. Twelve studies regarding GSTM1 null polymorphism
   (1569 cases and 2907 controls), 11 studies concerning GSTT1 null
   polymorphism (1515 cases and 2863 controls), and 8 studies on GSTP1
   Ile105Val (965 cases and 1604 controls) were included in the
   meta-analysis. The random effects odds ratio was 1.07 (95% CI:
   0.88-1.31; I(2) = 54.1%, P for heterogeneity = 0.013) for the GSTM1 null
   vs. present genotype and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.75-1.57; I(2) = 81.4%, P for
   heterogeneity < 0.001) for the GSTT1 null vs. present genotype, and 1.02
   (95% CI: 0.70-1.49; I(2) = 74.6%, P for heterogeneity < 0.001) for the
   GSTP1 Val/Val + Val/Ile vs. Ile/Ile genotype. Similarly, no significant
   associations were demonstrated for subgroup analyses performed by
   ethnicity and histological type. In conclusion, these three
   polymorphisms are unlikely to be major determinants of susceptibility to
   thyroid cancer. Reasons for potential heterogeneity of effects, which
   could include true biologic heterogeneity, publication bias, or chance,
   deserve further investigation. The relationship between these three
   genes and thyroid carcinoma must be evaluated further with gene-gene and
   gene-environment interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Induction of human lampbrush chromosomes
SO CHROMOSOME RESEARCH
AB We previously demonstrated that sperm heads from amphibians (Xenopus and
   Rana) and zebrafish (Danio) could form giant lampbrush chromosomes when
   injected into the nucleus of amphibian oocytes. However, similar
   experiments with mammalian sperm heads were unsuccessful. Here, we
   describe a slightly modified procedure and demonstrate that human sperm
   heads can form giant lampbrush chromosomes when injected into the oocyte
   nucleus of the frog Xenopus laevis or the newt Notophthalmus
   viridescens. Human and other mammalian chromosomes do not form
   recognizable lampbrush chromosomes in their own oocytes or in any
   somatic cells. These experiments thus demonstrate that the lampbrush
   condition is an inducible state and that the amphibian oocyte nucleus
   contains all factors required to remodel the inactive chromatin of a
   mammalian sperm into a transcriptionally active state. They also
   demonstrate that absence of lampbrush chromosomes from human oocytes
   must relate to specific features of mammalian oogenesis, not to
   permanent genetic or epigenetic changes in the chromatin.

TI Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis reveal that TFIIB
   occupies the SL RNA gene promoter region in Trypanosoma brucei
   chromosomes
SO MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY
AB RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II) synthesizes the m(7)G-capped Spliced Leader
   (SL) RNA and most protein-coding mRNAs in trypanosomes. RNAP-II
   recruitment to DNA usually requires a set of transcription factors that
   make sequence-specific contacts near transcriptional start sites within
   chromosomes. In trypanosomes, the transcription factor TFIIB is
   necessary for RNAP-II-dependent SL RNA transcription. However, the
   trypanosomal TFIIB (tTFIIB) lacks the highly basic DNA binding region
   normally found in the C-terminal region of TFIIB proteins. To assess the
   precise pattern of tTFIIB binding within the SL RNA gene locus, as well
   as within several other loci, we performed chromatin
   immunoprecipitation/microarray analysis using a tiled gene array with a
   probe spacing of 10 nucleotides. We found that tTFIIB binds non-randomly
   within the SL RNA gene locus mainly within a 220-nt long region that
   straddles the transcription start site. tTFIIB does not bind within the
   small subunit (SSU) rRNA locus, indicating that trypanosomal TFIIB is
   not a component of an RNAP-I transcriptional complex. Interestingly,
   discrete binding sites were observed within the putative promoter
   regions of two loci on different chromosomes. These data suggest that
   although trypanosomal TFIIB lacks a highly basic DNA binding region, it
   nevertheless localizes to discrete regions of chromatin that include the
   SL RNA gene promoter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mercury Bioaccumulation in Wood Frogs Developing in Seasonal Pools
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
AB Seasonal woodland pools contribute significant biomass to terrestrial
   eco-systems through production of pool-breeding amphibians. The movement
   of amphibian metamorphs potentially transports toxins bioaccumulated
   during larval development in the natal pool into the surrounding
   terrestrial environment. We documented total mercury (THg) in seasonal
   woodland pool water, sediment, litter, and Lithobates sylvaticus LeConte
   (Wood Frog) in Acadia National Park, ME. THg concentrations in pool
   water varied over the study season, increasing during April-June and
   remaining high in 2 of 4 pools upon October refill. Water in pools
   surrounded by softwoods had lower pH, greater dissolved organic carbon,
   and greater THg concentrations than pools surrounded by hardwoods, with
   seasonal patterns in sediment THg but not litter THg. THg increased
   rapidly from near or below detection in 1-2 week old embryos (< 0.2 ng;
   0-0.49 ppb wet weight) to 17.1-54.2 ppb in tadpoles within 6 weeks;
   7.2-42.0% of THg was methyl Hg in tadpoles near metamorphosis.
   Metamorphs emigrating from seasonal pools may transfer mercury into
   terrestrial food webs.

TI Fluoxetine reverses depressive-like behaviors and increases hippocampal
   acetylcholinesterase activity induced by olfactory bulbectomy
SO PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR
AB The olfactory bulbectomy (OB) is an animal model of depression that
   results in behavioral, neurochemical and neuroendocrinological changes,
   features comparable to those seen in depressive patients. This study
   investigated OB-induced alterations in locomotor activity and
   exploratory behavior in the open-field test, self-care and motivational
   behavior in the splash test, hyperactivity in the novel object test and
   novel cage test, and the influence of chronic treatment with fluoxetine
   (10 mg/kg, p.o., once daily for 14 days) on these parameters. Fluoxetine
   reversed OB-induced hyperactivity in the open-field test, locomotor
   hyperactivity and the increase in exploratory behavior induced by
   novelty in the novel object and novel cage tests, and the loss of
   self-care and motivational behavior in the splash test. Moreover. OB
   decreased the number of grooming and fecal boli in the open-field and
   novel cage tests, alterations that were not reversed by fluoxetine. OB
   caused an increase in hippocampal, but not in prefrontal
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Fluoxetine was able to reverse the
   increase in hippocampal AChE activity induced by OB. Serum
   corticosterone was increased in SHAM and bulbectomized mice treated with
   fluoxetine. In conclusion, OB mice exhibited depressive-like behaviors
   associated with an increase in hippocampal AChE activity, effects that
   were reversed by chronic treatment with fluoxetine. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Pesticide and insect repellent mixture (permethrin and DEET) induces
   epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and sperm
   epimutations
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB Environmental compounds are known to promote epigenetic
   transgenerational inheritance of disease. The current study was designed
   to determine if a "pesticide mixture" (pesticide permethrin and insect
   repellent N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide. DEET) promotes epigenetic
   transgenerational inheritance of disease and associated DNA methylation
   epimutations in sperm. Gestating F0 generation female rats were exposed
   during fetal gonadal sex determination and the incidence of disease
   evaluated in F1 and F3 generations. There were significant increases in
   the incidence of total diseases in animals from pesticide lineage F1 and
   F3 generation animals. Pubertal abnormalities, testis disease, and
   ovarian disease (primordial follicle loss and polycystic ovarian
   disease) were increased in F3 generation animals. Analysis of the
   pesticide lineage F3 generation sperm epigenome identified 363
   differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) termed epimutations.
   Observations demonstrate that a pesticide mixture (permethrin and DEET)
   can promote epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset
   disease and potential sperm epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral
   environmental exposures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI SPOC1 modulates DNA repair by regulating key determinants of chromatin
   compaction and DNA damage response
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Survival time-associated plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein in
   Ovarian Cancer 1 (SPOC1, also known as PHF13) is known to modulate
   chromatin structure and is essential for testicular stem-cell
   differentiation. Here we show that SPOC1 is recruited to DNA
   double-strand breaks (DSBs) in an ATM-dependent manner. Moreover, SPOC1
   localizes at endogenous repair foci, including OPT domains and
   accumulates at large DSB repair foci characteristic for delayed repair
   at heterochromatic sites. SPOC1 depletion enhances the kinetics of
   ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation after gamma-irradiation
   (gamma-IR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair activity, and
   cellular radioresistance, but impairs homologous recombination (HR)
   repair. Conversely, SPOC1 overexpression delays IRIF formation and cH2AX
   expansion, reduces NHEJ repair activity and enhances cellular
   radiosensitivity. SPOC1 mediates dose-dependent changes in chromatin
   association of DNA compaction factors KAP-1, HP1-alpha and H3K9
   methyltransferases (KMT) GLP, G9A and SETDB1. In addition, SPOC1
   interacts with KAP-1 and H3K9 KMTs, inhibits KAP-1 phosphorylation and
   enhances H3K9 trimethylation. These findings provide the first evidence
   for a function of SPOC1 in DNA damage response (DDR) and repair. SPOC1
   acts as a modulator of repair kinetics and choice of pathways. This
   involves its dose-dependent effects on DNA damage sensors, repair
   mediators and key regulators of chromatin structure.

TI The methylomes of six bacteria
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Six bacterial genomes, Geobacter metallireducens GS-15, Chromohalobacter
   salexigens, Vibrio breoganii 1C-10, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987,
   Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81-176 and C. jejuni NCTC 11168, all
   of which had previously been sequenced using other platforms were
   re-sequenced using single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing
   specifically to analyze their methylomes. In every case a number of new
   N(6)-methyladenine ((m6)A) and N(4)-methylcytosine ((m4)C) methylation
   patterns were discovered and the DNA methyltransferases (MTases)
   responsible for those methylation patterns were assigned. In 15 cases,
   it was possible to match MTase genes with MTase recognition sequences
   without further sub-cloning. Two Type I restriction systems required
   sub-cloning to differentiate their recognition sequences, while four
   MTase genes that were not expressed in the native organism were
   sub-cloned to test for viability and recognition sequences. Two of these
   proved active. No attempt was made to detect 5-methylcytosine ((m5)C)
   recognition motifs from the SMRT (R) sequencing data because this
   modification produces weaker signals using current methods. However, all
   predicted (m6)A and (m4)C MTases were detected unambiguously. This study
   shows that the addition of SMRT sequencing to traditional sequencing
   approaches gives a wealth of useful functional information about a
   genome showing not only which MTase genes are active but also revealing
   their recognition sequences.

   review
SO LARYNGOSCOPE
AB Thyroid carcinomas with massive intralumen invasion of the great veins
   are extremely rare and reported to have poor prognosis. We report a case
   of a poorly differentiated follicular carcinoma of the thyroid with
   extensive invasion into the bilateral internal jugular veins,
   brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava. All of the seven major
   drainage veins from the thyroid were involved by tumor thrombus. The
   patient was successfully treated by surgical resection including removal
   of the tumor thrombus and repair of the great veins. The importance of
   preoperative radiological findings, treatment, and outcome are discussed
   along with a literature review.

TI Personalization of radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease: a
   prospective, randomized study with a novel method for calculating the
   optimal I-131-iodide activity based on target reduction of thyroid mass
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB Aim. There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate dosimetric
   approach to cure Graves' disease. This study describes a personalized
   approach based on the desired therapy-induced volume (mass) reduction in
   order to define the activity of I-131-iodide to be administered, based
   on the MIRD approach and the radiobiological Linear Quadratic Model.
   Methods. A model for calculating the "optimal" final thyroid mass has
   been developed and published in the past years. Based on this model, it
   is possible to predict the thyroid absorbed dose following
   administration of a certain activity as a function of desired reduction
   of the starting mass of the gland. A total of 147 Graves' disease
   patients were randomly divided into four groups based on the absorbed
   thyroid dose, respectively 100 Gy (Group A, N.=29), 200 Gy (Group B,
   N.=25), and 400 Gy (Group C, N.=29), while patients of Group D (n=64)
   received a I-131-iodide activity calculated based on the desired
   "optimal" final thyroid mass.
   Results. At one-year follow-up, 48% of patients in Group A, 64% in Group
   B, 97% in Group C, and 94% in Group D were cured. There was no
   statistical difference between cure rate in Group C versus Group D. The
   administered I-131-iodide activity for Group C was significantly higher
   than for Group 13 (524 +/- 201 MBq versus 386 +/- 173 MBq, P<0.001).
   Conclusion. These results demonstrate that the proposed method allows to
   optimize I-131-iodide therapy for Graves' disease patients on an
   individual basis, avoiding the administration of unjustified higher
   activities.

TI Thyroid disorders during pregnancy
SO GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Thyroid physiology is altered during pregnancy as a result of an
   increase in thyroid-binding globulin, the stimulatory effect of hCG on
   TSH receptors, and increased peripheral thyroid hormone requirements. In
   addition, hyper and hypothyroid disorders are prevalent among women of
   reproductive age, and most of them have a significant impact on the
   gravida, fetus and neonate. Aberrant thyroid function can be readily
   recognized and treated during pregnancy, avoiding such complications.
   Here, we will review the thyroid function changes occurring during
   pregnancy, the different disorders, their maternal and fetal
   implications, and the ways to screen, prevent and treat these
   conditions.

TI Laboratory culturing of Elysia chlorotica reveals a shift from transient
   to permanent kleptoplasty
SO SYMBIOSIS
AB The kleptoplastic sacoglossan Elysia chlorotica shares a requisite,
   intracellular symbiosis with the plastids (= chloroplasts) of the
   Xanthophyte alga Vaucheria litorea. Although wild specimens have been
   used to address a range of biological questions, no studies have
   thoroughly characterized animal development during the initial
   establishment of the symbiosis under controlled laboratory conditions.
   Laboratory culture conditions were modified and the time required for
   successful metamorphosis was reduced by 40 % relative to previous work.
   Plastids were not initially stable within the host; "permanent
   kleptoplasty" was obtained only after a parts per thousand yen7 days of
   feeding on V. litorea. Feeding for shorter time periods resulted in the
   loss of plastids and abnormal development; this phase was characterized
   as "transient kleptoplasty". Individuals in the transient state
   exhibited a significantly greater decrease in length compared to animals
   with permanent kleptoplasts after the same starvation period. To test
   the effect of food availability after obtaining permanent kleptoplasty,
   animals were subjected to various dietary regimes followed by a recovery
   period of constant feeding. Thirty percent of animals survived prolonged
   starvation (> 4 weeks) after only the initial week of feeding required
   to establish permanent kleptoplasty. All treatments showed rapid growth
   when re-exposed to Vaucheria. Thus, during initial development E.
   chlorotica experiences enhanced fitness when Vaucheria is available for
   consumption. However, the animal rapidly establishes permanent
   kleptoplasty, which bestows flexible food requirements and resistance to
   food limitation, a likely advantage for E. chlorotica in salt marsh
   environments where Vaucheria sp. abundance is sporadic.

SO CHROMOSOMA
AB The metazoan nucleus is disassembled and re-built at every mitotic cell
   division. The nuclear envelope, including nuclear pore complexes, breaks
   down at the beginning of mitosis to accommodate the capture of massively

   membrane sheets of the envelope, the mechanisms governing nuclear pore
   complex assembly and integration in the nascent nuclear membranes, and
   the regulated coordination of these events with chromatin
   de-condensation.

TI Role of Epigenomics in Drug Discovery and Therapies
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB Recent studies suggest that the mammalian genome alone cannot completely
   explain many physiological and pathophysiological phenomena including
   variability in phenotypes, drug responses, discordance between
   monozygotic twins for the same trait or disorder, and disease
   susceptibility of an individual. The missing link could be epigenetic
   modifications of genome such as DNA methylation, numerous
   posttranslational modifications of histone proteins and regulation of
   expression of microRNAs. Epigenetic modifications are well known and are
   involved in normal mammalian development. They are modulated globally
   and in a gene-specific manner by environmental factors including
   nutrition, hormones, toxins, and drugs. Age also plays an important role
   in gene-environmental interactions. Epigenomic pathways are essential
   for normal cellular functions with abnormalities in their programming
   leading to complex disorders including psychiatric diseases. Epigenetic
   factors can thus serve as molecular markers to predict the
   responsiveness of diseases to therapy. Further knowledge of epigenomic
   changes and identification of factors that mediate alterations in the
   epigenome may lead to new drug targets and therapies. In this overview
   the importance of epigenomics in drug development and therapies has been

TI Genome-wide analysis of FoxO1 binding in hepatic chromatin: Potential
   involvement of FoxO1 in linking retinoid signaling to hepatic
   gluconeogenesis
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 is a critical regulator of
   hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, and dysregulation of FoxO1
   function has been implicated in diabetes and insulin resistance. We
   globally identified FoxO1 occupancy in mouse hepatic chromatin on a
   genome-wide level by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with
   high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). To establish the specific
   functional significance of FoxO1 against other FoxO proteins, ChIP-seq
   was performed with chromatin from liver-specific FoxO1 knockout and
   wild-type mice. Here we identified 401 genome-wide FoxO1-binding
   locations. Motif search reveals a sequence element, 5' GTAAACA 3',
   consistent with a previously known FoxO1-binding site. Gene set
   enrichment analysis shows that the data from FoxO1 ChIP-seq are highly
   correlated with the global expression profiling of genes regulated by
   FoxO1, demonstrating the functional relevance of our FoxO1 ChIP-seq
   study. Interestingly, gene ontology analysis reveals the functional
   significance of FoxO1 in retinoid metabolic processes. We show here that
   FoxO1 directly binds to the genomic sites for the genes in retinoid
   metabolism. Notably, deletion of FoxO1 caused a significantly reduced
   induction of Pck1 and Pdk4 in response to retinoids. As Pck1 and Pdk4
   are downstream targets of retinoid signaling, these results suggest that
   FoxO1 plays a potential role in linking retinoid metabolism to hepatic
   gluconeogenesis.

TI The Chromosomal Proteins JIL-1 and Z4/Putzig Regulate the Telomeric
   Chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Drosophila telomere maintenance depends on the transposition of the
   specialized retrotransposons HeT-A, TART, and TAHRE. Controlling the
   activation and silencing of these elements is crucial for a precise
   telomere function without compromising genomic integrity. Here we
   describe two chromosomal proteins, JIL-1 and Z4 (also known as Putzig),
   which are necessary for establishing a fine-tuned regulation of the
   transcription of the major component of Drosophila telomeres, the HeT-A
   retrotransposon, thus guaranteeing genome stability. We found that
   mutant alleles of JIL-1 have decreased HeT-A transcription, putting
   forward this kinase as the first positive regulator of telomere
   transcription in Drosophila described to date. We describe how the
   decrease in HeT-A transcription in JIL-1 alleles correlates with an
   increase in silencing chromatin marks such as H3K9me3 and HP1a at the
   HeT-A promoter. Moreover, we have detected that Z4 mutant alleles show
   moderate telomere instability, suggesting an important role of the
   JIL-1-Z4 complex in establishing and maintaining an appropriate
   chromatin environment at Drosophila telomeres. Interestingly, we have
   detected a biochemical interaction between Z4 and the HeT-A Gag protein,
   which could explain how the Z4-JIL-1 complex is targeted to the
   telomeres. Accordingly, we demonstrate that a phenotype of telomere
   instability similar to that observed for Z4 mutant alleles is found when
   the gene that encodes the HeT-A Gag protein is knocked down. We propose
   a model to explain the observed transcriptional and stability changes in
   relation to other heterochromatin components characteristic of
   Drosophila telomeres, such as HP1a.

   2012; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00421.2012.-Here, we tested the hypothesis
   that excess maternal androgen in late pregnancy reduces placental and
   fetal growth, increases placental steroidogenesis, and adversely affects
   glucose and lipid metabolism in adult female offspring. Pregnant Wistar
   rats were randomly assigned to treatment with testosterone (daily
   injections of 5 mg of free testosterone from gestational days 16 to 19)
   or vehicle alone. In experiment 1, fetal and placental weights,
   circulating maternal testosterone, estradiol, and corticosterone levels,
   and placental protein expression and distribution of estrogen
   receptor-alpha and -beta, androgen receptor, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase 2 were determined. In experiment 2, birth weights,
   postnatal growth rates, circulating testosterone, estradiol, and
   corticosterone levels, insulin sensitivity, adipocyte size, lipid
   profiles, and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver were assessed in
   female adult offspring. Treatment with testosterone reduced placental
   and fetal weights and increased placental expression of all four
   proteins. The offspring of testosterone-treated dams were born with
   intrauterine growth restriction; however, at 6 wk of age there was no
   difference in body weight between the offspring of testosterone-and
   control-treated rats. At 10-11 wk of age, the offspring of the
   testosterone-treated dams had less fat mass and smaller adipocyte size
   than those born to control rats and had no difference in insulin
   sensitivity. Circulating triglyceride levels were higher in the
   offspring of testosterone-treated dams, and they developed nonalcoholic
   fatty liver as adults. We demonstrate for the first time that prenatal
   testosterone exposure alters placental steroidogenesis and leads to
   dysregulation of lipid metabolism in their adult female offspring.

AB A successful, euthyroid outcome after radioiodine therapy in
   hyperthyroid cats ranges from 83% to 95%. Thyroid volume has been
   reported as one of the factors influencing radioiodine therapy outcome
   in man and cats. The goal of this study was to describe the most
   reliable and practically applicable formula to determine thyroid volume
   using scintigraphy. The volume of each thyroid lobe of 32 hyperthyroid
   cats was determined by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The
   ultrasonographically determined volume (ellipsoid formula) for each
   thyroid lobe was compared with the scintigraphic volume that was
   calculated using eight different formulas: F1 [(pi/6) x L x H x W], F2
   [(pi/2) x L x W(2)], F3 [0.33 x (area cm(2))(3/2)], F4 [1.08 x (pi/6) x
   L x W(2)], F5 (area x H), F6 (0.27 x area x L), F7 (pi x L x W(2)) and
   F8 [pi x (4/3) x W(3)]. F1, F3, F4 and F6 did not differ statistically
   from the volumes measured on ultrasound, while F2, F5, F7 and F8 did.
   Subjective shape assessment of the thyroid lobes, assigned as
   cylindrical or spherical, and the use of corresponding formulas, did not
   appear to be useful.

TI Occurrence of Epilepsy at Different Zeitgeber Times Alters Sleep
   Homeostasis Differently in Rats
SO SLEEP
AB Study Objectives: Controversial sleep disruptions (e.g., poor nighttime
   sleep and daytime somnolence) are common in epilepsy patients. Sleep is
   known to be regulated by homeostatic factors, which mediate sleep
   propensity, and the circadian oscillator, a clocklike mechanism.
   However, it is unknown how epileptic episodes that occur at different
   zeitgeber times (ZTs) alter sleep regulation. This study was designed to
   elucidate the sleep disruptions associated with epilepsy and their
   underlying mechanisms by delivering kindled epilepsy at different ZTs:
   ZT0, ZT6, and ZT13.
   Design: Kindled epilepsy was induced at 3 different ZTs, and sleep-wake
   activities were analyzed before and after full-blown seizure.
   Ribonuclease protection assay, radioimmunoassay, and
   immunohistochemistry were respectively employed to determine the levels
   of interleukin-1 mRNA, corticosterone, and PER1 protein.
   Setting: The experiments were performed at Neurophysiology Laboratory at
   National Taiwan University.
   Participant and Interventions: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted
   with electroencephalograph (EEG) electrodes, a bipolar stimulating
   electrode, and a guide cannula. Kindling stimuli were delivered via a
   bipolar electrode placed in the right central nucleus of the amygdala.
   Measurement and Results: Kindled epilepsy occurring at ZT0 and ZT13
   predominantly affected homeostatic factors, whereas ZT6-kindling stimuli
   altered the circadian oscillator. ZT0-kindling decreased rapid eye
   movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, which was mediated by
   corticotrophin-releasing hormone, but did not alter the rhythm of
   sleep-wake fluctuation. On the other hand, ZT13-kindling enhanced
   interleukin-1 and consequently increased NREM sleep without altering the
   sleep-wake fluctuation. Nevertheless, the expression of PER1 protein in
   suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and the circadian rhythm of
   sleep fluctuation were respectively advanced 6 h and 2 h when kindling
   stimulation was delivered at ZT6. Shifts of sleep circadian rhythm and
   PER1 oscillation induced by ZT6-kindling were blocked by administration
   of hypocretin receptor antagonist SB334867 into the SCN, indicating the
   involvement of hypocretin.
   Conclusion: These observations suggest that the occurrence of epilepsy
   at different ZTs alters sleep processes differently.

TI Effects of Exogenous Methionine on Arsenic Burden and NO Metabolism in
   Brain of Mice Exposed to Arsenite Through Drinking Water
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB The aim of this study was to explore the effects of exogenous methionine
   (Met) on arsenic burden and metabolism of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain
   of mice exposed to arsenite via drinking water. Mice were exposed to
   sodium arsenite through drinking water contaminated with 50 mg/L arsenic
   for four consecutive weeks, and treated intraperitoneally with saline
   solution, 100 mg/kg body weight (b.w), 200 mg/kg b.w or 400 mg/kg b.w of
   Met, respectively at the fourth week. Levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs),
   monomethylarsenic acid (MMAs), and dimethylarsenic acid (DMAs) in the
   liver, blood and brain were determined by method of hydride generation
   coupled with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Nitric oxide synthase
   (NOS) activities and NO levels in the brain were determined by
   colorimetric method. Compared with mice exposed to arsenite alone,
   administration of Met increased significantly the primary methylation
   ratio in the liver, which resulted in decrease of percent iAs and
   increase of percent DMAs in the liver, and decrease of iAs, MMAs and
   total arsenic levels (TAs) in the blood and DMAs and TAs in the brain.
   NOS activities and NO levels in the brain of mice exposed to arsenite
   alone were significantly lower than those in control, however
   administration of Met could increase significantly NO levels. Findings
   from this study suggested that exogenous Met could benefit the primary
   arsenic methylation in the liver, which might increase the production of
   methylated arsenicals and facilitate arsenic excretion. As a
   consequence, arsenic burden in both blood and brain was reduced, and
   toxic effects on NO metabolism in the brain were ameliorated. (C) 2011

TI Immunohistochemical analysis of the colocalization of
   corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in
   kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamus of female rats
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB Kisspeptin, a neuropeptide encoded by Kiss1 gene, plays pivotal roles in
   the regulation of reproductive function. Recently various stressors and
   stress-induced molecules such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
   and corticosterone have been shown to inhibit Kiss? expression in rat
   hypothalamus. To determine whether CRH and glucocorticoids directly act
   on kisspeptin neurons, we examined the colocalization of CRH receptor
   (CRH-R) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in kisspeptin neurons in the
   female rat hypothalamus. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry revealed
   that most kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular
   nucleus and periventricular nucleus continuum (AVPV/PeN), and arcuate
   nucleus (ARC) expressed CRH-R. We also observed a few close appositions
   of CRH immunoreactive fibers on some of kisspeptin neurons in AVPV/PeN
   and ARC. On the other hand, most kisspeptin neurons in AVPV/PeN
   expressed GR, whereas only a few of kisspeptin neurons in ARC expressed
   GR.
   Altogether, our study provides neuroanatomical evidence of the direct
   modulation of kisspeptin neurons by CRH and glucocorticoids and suggests
   that stress-induced CRH and glucocorticoids inhibit gonadotropin
   secretion via the kisspeptin system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

TI Histone H2A variants in nucleosomes and chromatin: more or less stable?
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB In eukaryotes, DNA is organized together with histones and non-histone
   proteins into a highly complex nucleoprotein structure called chromatin,
   with the nucleosome as its monomeric subunit. Various interconnected
   mechanisms regulate DNA accessibility, including replacement of
   canonical histones with specialized histone variants. Histone variant
   incorporation can lead to profound chromatin structure alterations
   thereby influencing a multitude of biological processes ranging from
   transcriptional regulation to genome stability. Among core histones, the
   H2A family exhibits highest sequence divergence, resulting in the
   largest number of variants known. Strikingly, H2A variants differ mostly
   in their C-terminus, including the docking domain, strategically placed
   at the DNA entry/exit site and implicated in interactions with the
   (H3-H4)(2)-tetramer within the nucleosome and in the L1 loop, the
   interaction interface of H2A-H2B dimers. Moreover, the acidic patch,
   important for internucleosomal contacts and higher-order chromatin
   structure, is altered between different H2A variants. Consequently, H2A
   variant incorporation has the potential to strongly regulate DNA
   organization on several levels resulting in meaningful biological
   output. Here, we review experimental evidence pinpointing towards
   outstanding roles of these highly variable regions of H2A family
   members, docking domain, L1 loop and acidic patch, and close by
   discussing their influence on nucleosome and higher-order chromatin
   structure and stability.

TI Productive thyroid follicular carcinoma in a wild barred owl (Strix
   varia)
SO JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION
AB An adult male barred owl (Strix varia) was found unable to fly on a
   pasture during the day. On presentation, several lacerations were noted
   on the left wing. The animal was anesthetized for radiographic
   examination, which revealed mild swelling and irregularity of the soft
   tissues of the left wing. Over the plane of the syrinx and great
   vessels, ill-defined soft tissue opacity was present. The anesthetic
   recovery was unsuccessful, and the patient died. On gross necropsy, a 1
   cm in diameter, round, soft, red-tan nodule, with scattered light tan to
   white foci was noticed between the right subclavian artery and the
   syrinx. The histopathology of this structure was characteristic of a
   thyroid follicular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells were immunoreactive to
   thyroglobulin and pancytokeratin proteins. A blood sample, taken
   antemortem, was analyzed for total and free thyroxine. Due to the lack
   of reference intervals for the current species, 4 blood samples from
   other barred owls were taken, 2 of which were clinically normal and 2
   with an unhealthy status. The thyroid values were higher than the
   controls (total thyroxine by radioimmunoassay [mu g/dl] 1.1 vs. <0.2,
   <0.2, 0.6, <0.2; free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis [ng/dl] >10 vs.
   <0.3, <0.3, 2.1, <0.3). Although the other 4 birds are not intended to
   serve as a reference interval because of the low number and unhealthy
   status, findings are indicative of a productive thyroid follicular
   carcinoma.

TI RNA-Directed DNA Methylation Is Involved in Regulating
   Photoperiod-Sensitive Male Sterility in Rice
SO MOLECULAR PLANT
AB Photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) is a valuable germplasm for
   hybrid rice breeding. Recently, we cloned pms3, a locus controlling
   PSMS, which encodes a long non-coding RNA called LDMAR required for
   normal male fertility of the rice plant under long-day conditions.
   Increased methylation in the promoter of LDMAR in the PSMS rice (Nongken
   585) relative to the wild-type (Nongken 58) reduced expression of LDMAR
   leading to male sterility under long-day conditions. In this study, we
   identified a siRNA named Psi LDMAR in the LDMAR promoter region that was
   more abundant in Nongken 585 than in Nongken 58. We showed that Psi
   LDMAR was likely derived from AK111270, a transcript obtained from the
   sense strand of the LDMAR promoter with its 3'-end having a 110-base
   overlap with the 5'-end of LDMAR. Overexpressing AK111270 in Nongken 585
   greatly enriched Psi LDMAR, which induced RNA-directed DNA methylation
   in the LDMAR promoter and repressed the expression of LDMAR. Reduction
   of LDMAR in Nongken 585 changed the critical day length for fertility
   recovery and delayed the fertility recovery under short-day conditions.
   This result added to our understanding of the molecular mechanism for
   PSMS.

TI From cells to chromatin: Capturing snapshots of genome organization with
   5C technology
SO METHODS
AB In eukaryotes, genome organization can be observed on many levels and at
   different scales. This organization is important not only to reduce
   chromosome length but also for the proper execution of various
   biological processes. High-resolution mapping of spatial chromatin
   structure was made possible by the development of the chromosome
   conformation capture (3C) technique. 3C uses chemical cross-linking
   followed by proximity-based ligation of fragmented DNA to capture
   frequently interacting chromatin segments in cell populations. Several
   3C-related methods capable of higher chromosome conformation mapping
   throughput were reported afterwards. These techniques include the
   3C-carbon copy (5C) approach, which offers the advantage of being highly
   quantitative and reproducible. We provide here an updated reference
   protocol for the production of SC libraries analyzed by next-generation
   sequencing or onto microarrays. A procedure used to verify that 3C
   library templates bear the high quality required to produce superior SC
   libraries is also described. We believe that this detailed protocol will
   help guide researchers in probing spatial genome organization and its
   role in various biological processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Effects of Cage Density, Sanitation Frequency, and Bedding Type on
   Animal Wellbeing and Health and Cage Environment in Mice and Rats
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of cage
   density, sanitation frequency, and bedding type on animal growth and
   welfare. At weaning, Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice were allocated
   to treatment groups according to sex, bedding type (shredded aspen,
   cellulose, or a 50:50 mixture), and cage density and sanitation
   frequency (inhouse cage density standards and sanitation procedures
   measured against Guide recommendations) for an 8-wk period. Body weight,
   feed disappearance, cage ammonia, ATP concentrations, behavior,
   morbidity, and mortality were assessed weekly; fecal corticosterone,
   microbiology, and lung histopathology (rats only) were evaluated at the
   culmination of the trial. In both rats and mice, parameters indicative
   of animal health and welfare were not significantly affected by cage
   density and sanitation frequency or bedding type. Occasional effects of
   feed disappearance and cage ammonia concentrations due to density and
   sanitation guidelines were noted in rat cages, and bedding type affected
   cage ammonia and ATP concentrations. Periodic spikes of cage ammonia and
   ATP concentrations were recorded in mouse cages maintained according to
   inhouse compared with Guide standards and in cages containing aspen
   compared with cellulose or aspen cellulose mixed bedding. Ongoing
   studies and historical data support the finding that deviations or
   exceptions from the cage density and sanitation frequency standards set
   forth in the Guide do not negatively affect animal health, welfare, or
   production parameters at our institution. These parameters appear to be
   credible measures of animal health and wellbeing and may be useful for
   evaluating performance standards for animal husbandry.

TI Pure docosahexaenoic acid can improve depression behaviors and affect
   HPA axis in mice
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to identify whether docosahexaenoic
   acid (DHA) has a vital antidepressant by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   axis (HPA axis) or not.
   METHODS: Mice were divided into 2 groups: control group and DHA dietary
   group. DHA dietary group was treated with DHA dietary everyday for
   consecutive 50 days. The forced swimming test and tail suspension test
   were conducted. Hypothalamic and erythrocyte fatty acids and monoamine
   neurotransmitters levels in hypothalamus were assayed; corticosterone,
   adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticotropin-releasing factor in serum,
   hypothalamus and pituitary were assayed, respectively.
   RESULTS: (1) In the forced swimming test, DHA dietary significantly
   decreased immobility time, whereas swimming time and climbing time were
   increased. In tail suspension test DHA dietary significantly shortened
   immobility time. (2) DHA dietary increased the ration of n-3/n-6
   (polyunsaturated fatty acids) and DHA level in hypothalamic and
   erythrocyte fatty acids; (3) DHA dietary significantly increased
   5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and dopamine levels in
   hypothalamus; (4) DHA dietary significantly decreased serum
   corticosterone level by 20.23% and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone
   level by 25.13%; significantly increased serum corticotropin releasing
   factor level by 21.92%. Besides, DHA dietary decreased arginine
   vasopressin level by 20.11% in hypothalamus, by 23.76% in pituitary
   tissues, respectively; (5) DHA dietary decreased corticotropin-releasing
   factor levels by 30.83% in hypothalamus, by 29.75% in pituitary tissues,
   respectively. In hypothalamus, DHA dietary decreased significantly
   adrenocorticotropic hormone level by 19.14%, but insignificantly
   decreased adrenocorticotropic hormone level in pituitary.
   CONCLUSIONS: DHA shows an antidepressant property. Moreover, DHA has
   multiple effects on depression including the monoamine neurotransmitter
   systems, red blood cell membranes and HPA axis.

TI Histone Methyltransferases MES-4 and MET-1 Promote Meiotic Checkpoint
   Activation in Caenorhabditis elegans
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Chromosomes that fail to synapse during meiosis become enriched for
   chromatin marks associated with heterochromatin assembly. This response,
   called meiotic silencing of unsynapsed or unpaired chromatin (MSUC), is
   conserved from fungi to mammals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, unsynapsed
   chromosomes also activate a meiotic checkpoint that monitors synapsis.
   The synapsis checkpoint signal is dependent on cis-acting loci called
   Pairing Centers (PCs). How PCs signal to activate the synapsis
   checkpoint is currently unknown. We show that a chromosomal duplication
   with PC activity is sufficient to activate the synapsis checkpoint and
   that it undergoes heterochromatin assembly less readily than a
   duplication of a non-PC region, suggesting that the chromatin state of
   these loci is important for checkpoint function. Consistent with this
   hypothesis, MES-4 and MET-1, chromatin-modifying enzymes associated with
   transcriptional activity, are required for the synapsis checkpoint. In
   addition, a duplication with PC activity undergoes heterochromatin
   assembly when mes-4 activity is reduced. MES-4 function is required
   specifically for the X chromosome, while MES-4 and MET-1 act redundantly
   to monitor autosomal synapsis. We propose that MES-4 and MET-1
   antagonize heterochromatin assembly at PCs of unsynapsed chromosomes by
   promoting a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment that is
   required for meiotic checkpoint function. Moreover, we suggest that
   different genetic requirements to monitor the behavior of sex
   chromosomes and autosomes allow for the lone unsynapsed X present in
   male germlines to be shielded from inappropriate checkpoint activation.

TI Genome-Wide RNA Polymerase II Profiles and RNA Accumulation Reveal
   Kinetics of Transcription and Associated Epigenetic Changes During
   Diurnal Cycles
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Interactions of cell-autonomous circadian oscillators with diurnal
   cycles govern the temporal compartmentalization of cell physiology in
   mammals. To understand the transcriptional and epigenetic basis of
   diurnal rhythms in mouse liver genome-wide, we generated temporal DNA
   occupancy profiles by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as well as profiles of
   the histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. We used these data to
   quantify the relationships of phases and amplitudes between different
   marks. We found that rhythmic Pol II recruitment at promoters rather
   than rhythmic transition from paused to productive elongation underlies
   diurnal gene transcription, a conclusion further supported by modeling.
   Moreover, Pol II occupancy preceded mRNA accumulation by 3 hours,
   consistent with mRNA half-lives. Both methylation marks showed that the
   epigenetic landscape is highly dynamic and globally remodeled during the
   24-hour cycle. While promoters of transcribed genes had tri-methylated
   H3K4 even at their trough activity times, tri-methylation levels reached
   their peak, on average, 1 hour after Pol II. Meanwhile, rhythms in
   tri-methylation of H3K36 lagged transcription by 3 hours. Finally,
   modeling profiles of Pol II occupancy and mRNA accumulation identified
   three classes of genes: one showing rhythmicity both in transcriptional
   and mRNA accumulation, a second class with rhythmic transcription but
   flat mRNA levels, and a third with constant transcription but rhythmic
   mRNAs. The latter class emphasizes widespread temporally gated
   posttranscriptional regulation in the mouse liver.

TI Subconjunctival Injection of Triamcinolone for the Treatment of Upper
   Lid Retraction Associated With Thyroid Eye Disease
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Management of retraction of the upper lid during the congestive phase of
   thyroid eye disease is usually limited to conservative treatment. We
   evaluated the efficacy of subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone for
   the treatment of the upper lid retraction associated with thyroid eye
   disease.
   Thirty patients (43 eyes, 11 men and 19 women) with the upper lid
   retraction associated with thyroid eye disease were evaluated between
   May 2009 and September 2010. A dose of 0.5 mL of triamcinolone acetonide
   (40 mg/mL) was injected into the subconjunctival space at the upper
   margin of the tarsus. If the upper lid retraction had not improved or
   was still severe 2 weeks after the initial injection, then triamcinolone
   was injected repeatedly at 2-week intervals. Photographs were taken
   before the injection and at the follow-up visit, and lid parameters
   including marginal reflex distance 1, interpalpebral fissure height,
   total palpebral fissure area, the upper nasal palpebral fissure area,
   and the upper temporal palpebral fissure area were measured. Changes in
   the lid parameters after the injection were evaluated.
   The mean number of injections per patient was 2.67, and the mean (SD)
   follow-up period was 260.97 (91.10) days. All lid parameters improved
   significantly after the triamcinolone injection (all P's < 0.05).
   Nineteen of 22 patients in the congestive phase responded to the
   triamcinolone injection; however, 6 of 8 patients in the fibrotic phase
   did not respond to the triamcinolone injection. Complications associated
   with the triamcinolone injection included an increased intraocular
   pressure (2 patients) and a mild ptosis (1 patient).
   The subconjunctival triamcinolone injection is a simple and effective
   treatment option for the upper lid retraction associated with thyroid
   eye disease, and this treatment is more effective for the patients in
   the congestive phase.

TI Cafeteria diet-induced obesity plus chronic stress alter serum leptin
   levels
SO PEPTIDES
AB Obesity is a disease that has become a serious public health issue
   worldwide, and chronic stressors, which are a problem for modern
   society, cause neuroendocrine changes with alterations in food intake.
   Obesity and chronic stress are associated with the development of
   cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. In this study, a rat
   model was used to evaluate the effects of a hypercaloric diet plus
   chronic restraint stress on the serum leptin and lipids levels and on
   the weight of specific adipose tissue (mesenteric, MAT; subcutaneous,
   SAT and visceral, VAT). Wistar rats were divided into the following 4
   groups: standard chow (C), hypercaloric diet (HD), stress plus standard
   chow (S), and stress plus hypercaloric diet (SHD). The animals in the
   stress groups were subjected to chronic stress (placed inside a 25 cm x
   7 cm plastic tube for 1 h per day, 5 days per week for 6 weeks). The
   following parameters were evaluated: the weight of the liver, adrenal
   glands and specific adipose tissue; the delta weight; the Lee index; and
   the serum levels of leptin, corticosterone, glucose, total cholesterol,
   and triglycerides. The hypercaloric diet induced obesity in rats,
   increasing the Lee index, weight, leptin, triglycerides, and cholesterol
   levels. The stress decreased weight gain even in animals fed a
   hypercaloric diet but did not prevent a significant increase in the Lee
   index. However, an interaction between the independent factors
   (hypercaloric diet and stress) was observed, which is demonstrated by
   the increased serum leptin levels in the animals exposed to both
   protocols. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   has not been conclusively studied under this aspect. COPD is a complex
   condition, which cannot be considered a lung-related disorder, but
   rather a systemic disease also associated to increased oxidative stress.
   We evaluated thyroid hormones and antioxidant systems, the lipophilic
   Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in COPD
   patients to reveal the presence of a low-T3 syndrome in COPD and
   investigate the correlation between thyroid hormones, lung function
   parameters and antioxidants.
   Methods: We studied: 32 COPD patients and 45 controls, evaluating
   thyrotropin (TSH), free-triiodotyronine (fT(3)), free-tetraiodotyronine
   (fT(4)), CoQ(10) (also corrected for cholesterol) and TAC. CoQ(10) was
   assayed by HPLC; TAC by the metmyoglobin-ABTS method and expressed as
   latency time (LAG) in radical species appearance.
   Results: We found significantly lower LAG values, fT(3) and fT(4) levels
   and significantly higher TSH in COPD patients vs. controls. LAG values
   significantly correlated with fT(3) concentration. 12 out of 32 patients
   exhibited fT(3) levels lower than normal range. So we divided COPD
   patients in 2 groups on the basis of the fT(3) concentration (normal
   fT(3) COPD and low fT(3) COPD). We observed lower LAG values in normal
   fT(3)-COPD, compared to healthy subjects, with a further significant
   reduction in low fT(3)-COPD patients. Moreover higher TSH concentration
   was present in normal fT(3)-COPD, compared to healthy subjects, with a
   further significant increase in low fT(3)-COPD patients.
   CoQ(10)/cholesterol ratio was higher in low fT(3)-COPD vs. normal
   fT(3)-COPD, with a nearly significant difference.
   Conclusions: These data seem to indicate an increased oxidative stress
   in low fT(3)-COPD and a role of fT(3) in modulating antioxidant systems.
   However low fT(3) levels are joined to metabolic indexes of true
   hypothyroidism, suggesting that elevated CoQ(10) expresses a reduced
   tissue utilization. These data might suggest the need of thyroid
   replacement therapy in such a condition.

TI Bisphenol-A affects the developmental progression and expression of
   heat-shock protein genes in the moth Sesamia nonagrioides
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB The effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on the endocrine system of vertebrates
   have been demonstrated in several studies. Here, we report the impact of
   BPA on the developmental progression and expression of heat shock
   protein genes on the terrestrial insect Sesamia nonagrioides
   (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). S. nonagrioides 1st instar larvae were exposed
   until the end of 6th (last) instar to selected concentrations of BPA (1
   mu g/L, 10 mu g/L, 100 mu g/L, 1 mg/L and 10 mg/L) applied in their
   artificial diets. The lower doses of BPA (1-10 mu g/L) were found to
   decrease larvae's weight while the 100 mu g/L dose increased it. The
   higher doses of BPA were found to induce various abnormal phenotypes
   during 5th instar larval molting, larval-pupal transformation and
   metamorphosis. The developmental and metamorphosis endpoints presented
   here may indicate the possible impact of BPA on terrestrial insects.
   Additionally, 6th instar larvae were injected with several
   concentrations of BPA. Semi-quantitative and Real-Time PCR assays were
   used to identify the effects of BPA in the transcriptional regulation of
   five heat shock protein genes (SnoHsp19.5, SnoHsp20.8, SnoHsp70,
   SnoHsc70 and SnoHsp83). Application of BPA by feeding or by injection
   induced the synthesis of the SnoHsp19.5 and SnoHsp20.8 mRNAs. The
   expression levels of SnoHsp70 were not affected. In contrast, SnoHsc70
   and SnoHsp83, which play a pivotal role in vertebrate sex steroid signal
   transduction, were elevated by BPA. Our results suggest that SnoHsp19.5,
   SnoHsp20.8, SnoHsp83 and SnoHsc70 genes can be modulated by BPA.

TI Analysis of long-range chromatin interactions using Chromosome
   Conformation Capture
SO METHODS
AB Chromosome Conformation Capture, or 3C, is a pioneering method for
   investigating the three-dimensional structure of chromatin. 3C is used
   to analyze long-range looping interactions between any pair of selected
   genomic loci. Most 3C studies focus on defined genomic regions of
   interest that can be up to several hundred Kb in size. The method has
   become widely adopted and has been modified to increase throughput to
   allow unbiased genome-wide analysis. These large-scale adaptations are
   presented in other articles in this issue of Methods. Here we describe
   the 3C procedure in detail, including the appropriate use of the
   technology, the experimental set-up, an optimized protocol and
   troubleshooting guide, and considerations for data analysis. The
   protocol described here contains previously unpublished improvements,
   which save time and reduce labor. We pay special attention to primer
   design, appropriate controls and data analysis. We include notes and
   discussion based on our extensive experience to help researchers
   understand the principles of 3C-based techniques and to avoid common
   pitfalls and mistakes. This paper represents a complete resource and
   detailed guide for anyone who desires to perform 3C. (c) 2012 Published

TI The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Family Members are Key Players in
   S-adenosylmethionine Formation by MAT2A and Modify BACE1 and PSEN1 Gene
   Expression-Relevance for Alzheimer's Disease
SO MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS
AB Central hallmark of Alzheimer's disease are senile plaques mainly
   composed of beta-amyloid, which is a cleavage product of the amyloid
   precursor protein (APP). The physiological function of APP and its
   family members APLP1 and APLP2 is poorly understood. In order to fill
   this gap, we established a cell-culture based model with simultaneous
   knockdown of all members of the family. A comprehensive proteome study
   of the APP/APLP1/APLP2 knockdown cell lysates versus controls revealed
   significant protein abundance changes of more than 30 proteins. Targeted
   validation of selected candidates by immunoblotting supported the
   significant down-regulation of the methionine adenosyltransferase II,
   alpha (MAT2A) as well as of peroxiredoxin 4 in the knockdown cells.
   Moreover, MAT2A was significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level as
   well. MAT2A catalyzes the production of S-adenosylmethionine from
   methionine and ATP, which plays a pivotal role in the methylation of
   neurotransmitters, DNA, proteins, and lipids. MAT2A-dependent
   significant up-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine was also detectable in
   the knockdown cells compared with controls. Our results point to a role
   of the APP family proteins in cellular methylation mechanisms and fit to
   findings of disturbed S-adenosylmethionine levels in tissue and CSF of
   Alzheimer disease patients versus controls. Importantly, methylation
   plays a central role for neurotransmitter generation like acetylcholine
   pointing to a crucial relevance of our findings for Alzheimer's disease.
   In addition, we identified differential gene expression of BACE1 and
   PSEN1 in the knockdown cells, which is possibly a consequence of MAT2A
   deregulation and may indicate a self regulatory mechanism. Molecular &

TI Tissue-Restricted Transcription from a Conserved Intragenic CpG Island
   in the Klf1 Gene in Mice
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB Beyond Mendelian inheritance, an understanding of the complexities and
   consequences of the transfer of nonhereditary information to successive
   generations is at an early stage. Such epigenetic functionality is
   exemplified by DNA methylation and, as genome-wide high-throughput
   methodologies emerge, is increasingly being considered in the context of
   conserved intragenic and intergenic CpG islands that function as
   alternate sites of transcription initiation. Here we characterize an
   intragenic CpG island in exon 2 of the protein-coding mouse Klf1 gene,
   from which clustered transcription initiation sites yield
   positive-strand, severely truncated, capped and spliced RNAs. Expression
   from this CpG island in the testis begins between Postnatal Days 14-20,
   increases during development, and is temporally correlated with the
   maturation of secondary spermatocytes as they become the dominant cell
   population in the seminiferous epithelium. Only full-length
   KLF1-encoding mRNAs are detected in the hematopoietic tissue, spleen;
   thus, expression from the exon 2 CpG island is both developmentally
   regulated and tissue restricted. DNA methylation analysis indicates that
   spatiotemporal expression from the Klf1 CpG island is not associated
   with hypermethylation. Finally, our computational analysis from multiple
   species confirms intragenic transcription initiation and indicates that
   the KLF1 CpG island is evolutionarily conserved. Currently we have no
   evidence that these truncated RNAs can be translated via nonconventional
   mechanisms such as in-frame, conserved non-AUG-dependent Kozak consensus
   sequences; however, high-quality carboxyl-terminal antibodies will more
   effectively address this issue.

TI Accuracy of Ultrasound Elastography in the Diagnosis of Thyroid Cancer
   in a Low-risk Population
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES
AB Objective: Stiffness has been associated to malignancy in prostate and
   breast, as well as thyroid. Ultrasound elastography objectively measures
   tissue elasticity, and previous studies have described it as a high
   sensitivity and specificity technique for the detection of malignant
   thyroid nodules in high-risk populations. The aim was to assess the
   accuracy of elastography in a population with low risk of malignancy.
   Design and patients: 128 consecutive patients with nodular goiter were
   recruited. Elastography and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration
   were performed. When malignancy was suspected by citology, surgery was
   recommended. Thyroid nodules were classified by elastography according
   the criteria described by Ueno, and an alternative classification.
   Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and odds ratio were
   calculated.
   Results: Most patients were female, aged 56.1 year, with single nodule
   (52.0 %) or multinodular goiter (45.6 %), and a few thyroiditis (2.4 %).
   The majority of nodules were mostly elastic. Fine-needle aspiration
   found 86 % of benign nodules, 9.3 % of indeterminate, and 4.7 % possibly
   malignant. After surgery, 3 malignant nodules were confirmed, all of
   them being papillary carcinomas. All the malignant nodules were mostly
   elastic, as well as 75 % of indeterminate nodules. Low values of
   sensitivity and specificity were found for elastic nodules being benign
   and hard nodules malignant.
   Conclusion: In a low-risk population for thyroid cancer, elastography
   lacks accuracy for the diagnosis of malignant nodules. Clinical Trials

TI Mobilization of Stowaway-like MITEs in newly formed allohexaploid wheat
   species
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Transposable elements (TEs) dominate the genetic capacity of most
   eukaryotes, especially plants, where they can account for up to 90 % of
   the genome, such as in wheat. The relationship between TEs and their
   hosts and the role of TEs in organismal biology are poorly understood.
   In this study, we have applied next generation sequencing, together with
   a transposon display technique in order to test whether a Stowaway-like
   MITE, termed Minos, transposes following allopolyploidization events in
   wheat. We have generated a 454-pyrosequencing database of Minos-specific
   amplicons (transposon display products) from a newly formed wheat
   allohexaploid and its parental lines and retrieved hundreds of novel
   MITE insertions in the allohexaploid. Clear mobilization of Minos was
   also seen by site-specific PCR analysis and sequence validation. In
   addition, using real-time qPCR analysis we observed an insignificant
   change in the relative quantity of Minos from the expected value of
   merging the two parental genomes, indicating that, despite its
   activation, no significant burst in Minos copy number can be seen in the
   newly formed allohexaploid. Interestingly, we found that CCGG sites
   surrounding Minos underwent massive hypermethylation following the
   allohexaploidization process. Our data suggest that MITEs have
   maintained their capacity for activity throughout the evolution of wheat
   and might be epigenetically deregulated in the first generations
   following allopolyploidization.

TI Radiation exposure of eyes, thyroid gland and hands in orthopaedic
   staff: a systematic review
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Various procedures, especially minimal invasive techniques
   using fluoroscopy, pose a risk of radiation exposure to orthopaedic
   staff. Anatomical sites such as the eyes, thyroid glands and hands are
   more vulnerable to radiation considering the limited use of personal
   protective devices in the workplace. The objective of the study is to
   assess the annual mean cumulative and per procedure radiation dose
   received at anatomical locations like eyes, thyroid glands and hands in
   orthopaedic staff using systematic review.
   Methods: The review of literature was conducted using systematic search
   of the database sources like PUBMED and EMBASE using appropriate
   keywords. The eligibility criteria and the data extraction of literature
   were based on study design (cohort or cross-sectional study), study
   population (orthopaedic surgeons or their assistants), exposure (doses
   of workplace radiation exposure at hands/fingers, eye/forehead,
   neck/thyroid), language (German and English). The literature search was
   conducted using a PRISMA checklist and flow chart.
   Results: Forty-two articles were found eligible and included for the
   review. The results show that radiation doses for the anatomical
   locations of eye, thyroid gland and hands were lower than the dose
   levels recommended. But there is a considerable variation of radiation
   dose received at all three anatomical locations mainly due to different
   situations including procedures (open and minimally invasive), work
   experience (junior and senior surgeons), distance from the primary and
   secondary radiation, and use of personal protective equipments (PPEs).
   The surgeons receive higher radiation dose during minimally invasive
   procedures compared to open procedures. Junior surgeons are at higher
   risk of radiation exposure compared to seniors. PPEs play a significant
   role in reduction of radiation dose.
   Conclusions: Although the current radiation precautions appear to be
   adequate based on the low dose radiation, more in-depth studies are
   required on the variations of radiation dose in orthopaedic staff, at
   different anatomical locations and situations.

TI Changes in specialized blood vessels in lymph nodes and their role in
   cancer metastasis
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: High endothelial venules (HEV) have been recognized to play
   a role in metastasis by its changes seen in the cancer microenvironment
   of lymph nodes (LN) and solid cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of
   the tongue is a prevalent tumor of the head and neck region with high
   propensity for LN metastasis. The extent of LN metastasis is the most
   reliable adverse prognostic factor. Primary tumors can induce
   vasculature reorganization within sentinel LN before the arrival of
   tumor cells and HEV represents these remodelled vessels. This study aims
   to evaluate the cancer induced vascular changes in regional lymph nodes
   (LN) of patients by studying the morphological and functional
   alterations of HEV and its correlation with clinical outcome and
   pathological features.
   Methods: This study was based on 65 patients with SCC tongue who
   underwent primary surgical treatment including neck dissection. The
   patients were categorized into 2 groups based on the presence of
   malignancy in their cervical lymph nodes. A review of the patients'
   pathological and clinical data was performed from a prospective
   database. Immunohistochemical staining of the tissue blocks for HEV and
   high-power-field image analysis were performed and analyzed with
   correlation to the patients' clinical and pathological features.
   Results: The total number of HEV was found to be significantly
   associated to disease-free interval. There was a similar association
   comparing the HEV parameters to overall survival. The density of
   abnormal HEV was significantly higher in patients with established
   metastases in their lymph nodes and HEV was shown to be a better
   prognosis factor than conventional tumor staging. The HEV morphological
   metamorphosis demonstrates a spectrum that correlates well with disease
   progression and clinical outcome.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the HEV displays a spectrum of
   morphological changes in the presence of cancer and LN metastasis, and
   that HEV is possibly involved in the process of cancer metastasis. We
   revealed the relationship of HEV and their metamorphosis in
   pre-metastatic and metastatic environments in regional lymph nodes of
   tongue cancer patients in relation to clinical outcomes. The significant
   observation of modified dilated HEV containing red blood cells in lymph
   nodal basin of a cancer suggests the shifting of its function from one
   primarily of immune response to that of a blood carrying vessel. It also
   demonstrated potential prognostic value. More studies are needed to
   elucidate its potential role in cancer immunotherapy and as a potential
   novel therapeutic approach to preventing metastasis by manipulating the
   remodelling processes of HEV.

TI The widened use of exogenous stimulation with recombinant human TSH to
   treat metastatic thyroid carcinoma in Italy
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB Recently, in Italy, the reimbursement for the use of rhTSH in preparing
   patients for radiometabolic treatment of iodine-avid metastases from
   differentiated thyroid cancer has been made possible.
   Intramuscular administration of rhTSH increases the radioiodine uptake
   and thyroglobulin production by thyroid cells. In addition to the
   previous indications on the use of rhTSH (mainly: serum thyreoglobulin
   assay with or without (131)I scintigraphy and ablation with (131)I of
   remnants in low risk patients), the reimbursement is now allowed for the
   treatment with radioiodine of iodine-avid loco-regional and distant
   metastases, in subjects with inability to reach adequate TSH levels
   and/or severe clinical conditions which could be potentially worsened by
   other concurrent diseases (history of stroke or transient ischemic
   attack, severe cardiac disease, renal failure or major psychiatric
   disorders). The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) approved this use (and
   added this hormone in the special list of drugs regulated by the D.Lgs
   648/96) on the basis of a series of scientific evidences, proposed by a
   "team of experts". In the present paper we illustrate the scientific
   background of the use of rhTSH (clinical usefulness, economic
   considerations, aspects related to a better quality of life) that
   allowed the modification of the reimbursement and how it was made
   possible in the Italian legislative context.

TI Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Monitoring during Thyroid Surgery: Normative
   Vagal and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Electrophysiological Data
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB Objective. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) remains a
   significant cause of morbidity during thyroid surgery. Intraoperative
   nerve monitoring (IONM) is being applied in many centers to facilitate
   nerve identification. The aim of this study was to elucidate normative
   human vagal and recurrent laryngeal nerve electromyograhic (EMG)
   parameters during standard IONM application.
   Study Design. A prospective IONM study conducted over an 8-month period.
   Internal review board (IRB) approval was obtained.
   Settings. Department of Otolaryngology, Division of Thyroid and
   Parathyroid Surgery, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston.
   Subjects and Methods. All patients who were scheduled for routine
   thyroid, parathyroid, or neck exploration surgery were invited to
   participate. All patients had a preoperative and postoperative laryngeal
   examination to assess vocal cord function. Any patient with an abnormal
   preoperative laryngeal examination was excluded.
   Results. Fifty-eight patients participated in this study. The right and
   left RLN latencies were similar. The left vagus latency was greater than
   the right vagus but was not significant. The RLN latency was
   significantly less than the vagus nerve. The right vagus nerve amplitude
   was significantly greater than the left. There was no difference between
   male and female amplitudes for either the RLN or vagus nerve.
   Conclusion. This study highlights the electrophysiological/EMG
   differences and similarities between the RLN and vagus nerve. Normative
   amplitude measurements for bilateral RLN and vagus nerve stimulation are
   presented. There are limited data available in the literature on normal
   RLN and vagal EMG signals generated during thyroid surgery.

TI ADVANTAGES OF LONG-TERM, MULTI-SCALE MONITORING: ASSESSING THE CURRENT
   STATUS OF THE YOSEMITE TOAD (ANAXYRUS [BUFO] CANORUS) IN THE SIERRA
   NEVADA, CALIFORNIA, USA
SO HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY
AB A comprehensive bioregional evaluation of the current status of at-risk
   species is critical for effective management and conservation. As part
   of a long-term, multi-scale amphibian monitoring program, we evaluated
   the current status of the Yosemite Toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] canorus) on
   national forest lands across the species' range in the Sierra Nevada,
   California, USA. We conducted monitoring at extensive (rangewide) and
   intensive (individual population) scales with small watersheds (2-4
   km(2)), individual meadows, and breeding areas within meadows as sample
   units. Yosemite Toad breeding was found in an estimated proportion of
   0.84 +/- 0.03 (SE) of recently occupied watersheds (locality data from
   1990-2001), and 0.13 +/- 0.04 of historically occupied watersheds
   (locality data prior to 1990). Rangewide, breeding was found in an
   estimated proportion of 0.22 +/- 0.01 of watersheds. We quantified
   demographic parameters (abundance and survival of breeding males,
   abundance of egg masses, successful metamorphosis) in six meadows in two
   watersheds. Abundances were small, with the largest populations having
   only 16-21 and 18-19 breeding males each year. Annual survival rates of
   males by meadow ranged from 0.49-0.72. Numbers of egg masses per year
   were low, and the proportion of breeding areas with successful
   metamorphosis ranged from 0.14-0.73. Using the multi-scale data, we
   examined Yosemite Toad spatial and temporal occupancy patterns. Yosemite
   Toads tended to breed in one or two sites (lakes, meadows, stream
   reaches) per watershed every year, and occasionally in other sites. This
   assessment of the status of the Yosemite Toad will inform management
   decisions at both bioregional and population scales and the development
   of conservation priorities.

TI Glucocorticoids interact with the noradrenergic arousal system in the
   nucleus accumbens shell to enhance memory consolidation of both
   appetitive and aversive taste learning
SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY
AB It is well established that glucocorticoid hormones strengthen the
   consolidation of long-term memory of emotionally arousing experiences
   but have little effect on memory of low-arousing experiences. Although
   both positive and negative emotionally arousing events tend to be well
   remembered, studies investigating the neural mechanism underlying
   glucocorticoid-induced memory enhancement focused primarily on
   negatively motivated training experiences. In the present study we show
   an involvement of glucocorticoids within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in
   enhancing memory consolidation of both an appetitive and aversive form
   of taste learning. The specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist RU
   28362 (1 or 3 ng) administered bilaterally into the NAc shell, but not
   core, of male Sprague-Dawley rats immediately after an appetitive
   saccharin drinking experience dose-dependently enhanced 24-h retention
   of the safe taste, resulting in a facilitated attenuation of neophobia.
   Similarly, GR agonist infusions given into the NAc shell immediately
   after pairing of the saccharin taste with a malaise-inducing agent
   enhanced memory of this negative experience, resulting in an intensified
   conditioned aversion. Importantly, a suppression of noradrenergic
   activity within the NAc shell with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist
   propranolol blocked the facilitating effect of a concurrently
   administered GR agonist on memory consolidation in both the appetitive
   and aversive learning task. Thus, these findings indicate that GR
   activation interacts with the noradrenergic arousal system within the
   NAc to enhance memory consolidation of emotionally arousing training
   experiences regardless of valence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Reevaluating the Prognostic Significance of Age in Differentiated
   Thyroid Cancer
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB Objective. To determine the impact of age on disease-specific survival
   in differentiated thyroid cancer.
   Study Design. Retrospective analysis of a large population database.
   Setting. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
   database/multiple settings.
   Subjects and Methods. The SEER database was examined to identify
   patients diagnosed with either papillary or follicular carcinoma of the
   thyroid between the years 1988 and 2003. Information obtained included
   patient age, sex, tumor type, size, extension, and nodal or distant
   metastases. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to estimate
   disease-specific survival based on patient age range, and the log-rank
   test was used to assess for statistical differences between survival
   curves. A multivariate analysis was performed including the variables
   listed above to determine disease-specific hazard ratios of death for
   various age cutoffs.
   Results. A total of 42,209 patients were identified. Patients 45 years
   and older had significantly worse survival than younger patients (P <
   .0001). A significant decrease in disease-specific survival was first
   seen in patients aged 35 years and older, and survival continued to
   steadily decrease with each additional decade of age (P < . 001).
   Patients aged 35 years and older were 14 times more likely to die from
   differentiated thyroid cancer than patients younger than 35 years.
   Conclusion. Increasing age is associated with poorer survival in
   differentiated thyroid cancer. This relationship represents a continuum
   with an initial decrease in survival starting at age 35 years that
   continues to decline with further advancing age.

TI Chromatin remodeling by the SWI/SNF complex is essential for
   transcription mediated by the yeast cell wall integrity MAPK pathway
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcriptional program triggered by
   cell wall stress is coordinated by Slt2/Mpk1, the mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK) of the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, and is
   mostly mediated by the transcription factor Rlm1. Here we show that the
   SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex plays a critical role in
   orchestrating the transcriptional response regulated by Rlm1. swi/snf
   mutants show drastically reduced expression of cell wall
   stress-responsive genes and hypersensitivity to cell wall-interfering
   compounds. On stress, binding of RNA Pol II to the promoters of these
   genes depends on Rlm1, Slt2, and SWI/SNF. Rlm1 physically interacts with
   SWI/SNF to direct its association to target promoters. Finally, we
   observe nucleosome displacement at the CWI-responsive gene MLP1/KDX1,
   which relies on the SWI/SNF complex. Taken together, our results
   identify the SWI/SNF complex as a key element of the CWI MAPK pathway
   that mediates the chromatin remodeling necessary for adequate
   transcriptional response to cell wall stress.

TI Understanding of the impact of chemicals on amphibians: a meta-analytic
   review
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Many studies have assessed the impact of different pollutants on
   amphibians across a variety of experimental venues (laboratory,
   mesocosm, and enclosure conditions). Past reviews, using vote-counting
   methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by
   amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical
   power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do
   not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these
   challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that
   measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and
   phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other
   wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on
   amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and
   frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant
   exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a
   large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3%
   decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in
   abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no
   overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to
   metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among
   experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected
   weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that
   variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of
   phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was
   detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among
   stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on
   amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that
   pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important
   threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global
   decline.

TI Masculine Epigenetic Sex Marks of the CYP19A1/Aromatase Promoter in
   Genetically Male Chicken Embryonic Gonads Are Resistant to
   Estrogen-Induced Phenotypic Sex Conversion
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB Sex of birds is genetically determined through inheritance of the ZW sex
   chromosomes (ZZ males and ZW females). Although the mechanisms of avian
   sex determination remains unknown, the genetic sex is experimentally
   reversible by in ovo exposure to exogenous estrogens (ZZ-male
   feminization) or aromatase inhibitors (ZW-female masculinization).
   Expression of various testis-and ovary-specific marker genes during the
   normal and reversed gonadal sex differentiation in chicken embryos has
   been extensively studied, but the roles of sex-specific epigenetic marks
   in sex differentiation are unknown. In this study, we show that a 170-nt
   region in the promoter of CYP19A1/aromatase, a key gene required for
   ovarian estrogen biosynthesis and feminization of chicken embryonic
   gonads, contains highly quantitative, nucleotide base-level epigenetic
   marks that reflect phenotypic gonadal sex differentiation. We developed
   a protocol to feminize ZZ-male chicken embryonic gonads in a highly
   quantitative manner by direct injection of emulsified ethynylestradiol
   into yolk at various developmental stages. Taking advantage of this
   experimental sex reversal model, we show that the epigenetic sex marks
   in the CYP19A1/aromatase promoter involving DNA methylation and histone
   lysine methylation are feminized significantly but only partially in
   sex-converted gonads even when morphological and transcriptional marks
   of sex differentiation show complete feminization, being
   indistinguishable from gonads of normal ZW females. Our study suggests
   that the epigenetic sex of chicken embryonic gonads is more stable than
   the morphologically or transcriptionally characterized sex
   differentiation, suggesting the importance of the nucleotide base-level
   epigenetic sex in gonadal sex differentiation.

TI INVESTIGATING THE OPTIMAL REARING STRATEGY FOR AMBYSTOMA SALAMANDERS
   USING A HEMATOLOGICAL STRESS INDEX
SO HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY
AB Captive-rearing for conservation endeavors is often used as a management
   tool in response to amphibian declines. The goal of such projects should
   be to produce organisms that are as functionally equivalent to their
   wild counterparts as possible. Caudates (salamanders) in the genus
   Ambystoma represent a challenge for rearing because of their aggressive
   nature, and several recent projects have found higher than normal stress
   levels in captive-reared salamanders. In this study I compared various
   captive-rearing scenarios designed to minimize stress levels in Spotted
   Salamanders (A. maculatum). I reared larvae in five treatments, three
   that varied in starting density (six, 12, and 30 larvae per 1000 L
   tank), one with high food, and one with added environmental complexity
   to the tanks (sticks and refugia). After metamorphosis, I weighed the
   salamanders and collected blood samples to determine the relative
   abundance of two white blood cell types (neutrophils and lymphocytes) to
   calculate neutrophil-lymphocyte (N-L) ratios, which covary with stress
   hormone levels. Increasing density led to lower salamander body mass and
   decreased survival. Adding food, however, was not effective at
   increasing survival or body mass, or at lowering the average
   hematological stress index (N-L ratio). Likewise, adding complexity to
   the tanks did not affect these variables. Moreover, it was difficult to
   capture the metamorphosed salamanders from the tanks with the refugia
   and sticks. The treatment that led to the largest salamanders overall
   and the only one where N-L ratios were similar to those from the wild
   was the treatment with the lowest starting density (six larvae per 1000
   L tank). Furthermore, N-L ratios across all treatments were a direct
   function of body size; larger salamanders exhibited lower stress.

TI Importance of Measurement of Thyroglobulin and Anti-Thyroglobulin
   Antibodies in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB Differentiated thyroid cancers include papillary and follicular
   carcinomas, both originating from follicular epithelium. Treatment of
   choice is usually total or near total thyroidectomy, followed by
   ablative radioiodine (131)I treatment, and by the long term
   administration of thyroid hormone. Despite its excellent prognosis,
   recurrent disease does occur in approximately 20-40% of patients.
   Guidelines for the follow-up management of differentiated thyroid cancer
   are commonly based on circulating thyrogobulin measurement in the
   complete absence of eutopic thyroid tissue. A retrospective review was
   conducted on 116 patients (66 papillary and 50 follicular carcinoma,
   mean age 51.2 years) who had undergone total or near total thyroidectomy
   and radioactive iodine remnant ablation. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and
   anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) levels were measured
   preoperatively, 1 month after thyroidectomy (before (131)I treatment)
   and 6 and 12 months after ablation therapy (Tg 1, TgAb1 and Tg2, TgAb2,
   respectively). During one year of follow-up, in a total of 24 patients
   (21%) recurrent disease were confirmed by ultrasonography and
   whole-body-scanning, mostly. It was found significant correlation
   between serum Tg levels (measured preoperatively and postoperatively)
   and recurrent diseases (p<0.05), while serum TgAb levels did not have
   any statistical significance. However, in multivariate regression
   analysis only Tg levels measured 12 months after the therapy (Tg2)
   remained a significant predictor of recurrent disease (p=0.008).
   Although a high Tg level before surgery does not indicate that tumor is
   present, in the postoperative period and after ablative therapy Tg has
   proven predictive value because stimulated Tg levels above 10ng/ml
   confirmed that indicate residual or recurrent cancer, and its
   periodically measurements is recommended.

TI Epigenetic Influence of Stress and the Social Environment
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Animal models of early-life stress and variation in social experience
   across the lifespan have contributed significantly to our understanding
   of the environmental regulation of the developing brain. Plasticity in
   neurobiological pathways regulating stress responsivity, cognition, and
   reproductive behavior is apparent during the prenatal period and
   continues into adulthood, suggesting a lifelong sensitivity to
   environmental cues. Recent evidence suggests that dynamic epigenetic
   changes-molecular modifications that alter gene expression without
   altering the underlying DNA sequence-account for this plasticity. In
   this review, we highlight studies of laboratory rodents that illustrate
   the association between the experience of prenatal stress, maternal
   separation, maternal care, abusive caregiving in infancy, juvenile
   social housing, and adult social stress and variation in DNA methylation
   and histone modification. Moreover, we discuss emerging evidence for the
   transgenerational impact of these experiences. These experimental
   paradigms have yielded insights into the potential role of epigenetic
   mechanisms in mediating the effects of the environment on human
   development and also indicate that consideration of the sensitivity of
   laboratory animals to environmental cues may be an important factor in
   predicting long-term health and welfare.

TI Identification of gntK, a gene required for the methylation of

SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB Gentamicin and sisomicin are two different aminoglycoside antibiotics.
   The comparison of their chemical structure and biosynthetic gene
   clusters, coupled with bioinformatic analysis, suggested that the gntK
   gene would be associated with methylation. The gntK gene fragment in M.
   purpurea G1008 was inactivated by genetic engineering and its mutant
   strain M. purpurea GK1101 (Delta gntK) was screened. The metabolites of
   G1008 and GK1101 was analyzed by HPLC-MS, which revealed that GK1101 no
   longer produced gentamicin C(1) or C(2), while mainly synthesizing
   gentamicin C(1a), and the production of C(1a) increased significantly.
   This indicated that the metabolic flow for the gentamicin C(1) and C(2)
   biosynthesis was blocked by disrupting the gntK gene, which
   substantiated that the gntK gene encoded the enzyme that catalyzes the
   methylation of purpurosamine C-6'. The mutant GK1101 has good prospects
   for industrial application. In addition, our study provides information
   that can be used to clarify the function of a single gene and simplify
   the targeted genetic breeding of important pharmaceutical

TI Epigenetic contributions in the development of rheumatoid arthritis
SO ARTHRITIS RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by
   chronic inflammation of the joints with severe pain and swelling, joint
   damage and disability, which leads to joint destruction and loss of
   function. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying cause for
   RA is still unknown and current therapies are more or less effective in
   controlling symptoms but still fail to cure the disease. In recent
   years, epigenetic modifications were found to strongly contribute to the
   development of RA by affecting diverse aspects of the disease and
   modifying gene expression levels and behavior of several cell types,
   first and foremost joint resident synovial fibroblasts (SF). RASF are
   the most common cell type at the site of invasion. Owing to their
   aggressive, intrinsically activated phenotype, RASF are active
   contributors in joint damage. RASF are characterized by their ability to
   secrete cytokines, chemokines and joint-damaging enzymes. Furthermore,
   these cells are resistant to apoptosis, leading to hyperplasia of the
   synovium. In addition, RASF have invasive and migratory properties that
   could lead to spreading of the disease to unaffected joints. Epigenetic
   modifications, including DNA methylation and post-translational histone
   modifications, such as histone (de) acetylation, histone methylation and
   histone sumoylation were identified as regulatory mechanisms in
   controlling aggressive cell activation in vitro and in disease outcome
   in animal models in vivo. In the last 5 years, the field of epigenetics
   in RA has impressively increased. In this review we consider the role of
   diverse epigenetic modifications in the development of RA, with a
   special focus on epigenetic modifications in RASF.

TI Nuclear damages and oxidative stress: new perspectives for laminopathies
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY
AB Mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins, particularly LMNA
   encoding the A-type lamins, cause a broad range of diverse diseases,
   referred to as laminopathies. The astonishing variety of diseased
   phenotypes suggests that different mechanisms could be involved in the
   pathogenesis of laminopathies. In this review we will focus mainly on
   two of these pathogenic mechanisms: the nuclear damages affecting the
   chromatin organization, and the oxidative stress causing un-repairable
   DNA damages. Alteration in the nuclear profile and in chromatin
   organization, which are particularly impressive in systemic
   laminopathies whose cells undergo premature senescence, are mainly due
   to accumulation of unprocessed prelamin A. The toxic effect of these
   molecular species, which interfere with chromatin-associated proteins,
   transcription factors, and signaling pathways, could be reduced by drugs
   which reduce their farnesylation and/or stability. In particular,
   inhibitors of farnesyl transferase (Ens), have been proved to be active
   in rescuing the altered cellular phenotype, and statins, also in
   association with other drugs, have been included into pilot clinical
   trials. The identification of a mechanism that accounts for accumulation
   of un-repairable DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   generation in laminopathic cells, similar to that found in other
   muscular dystrophies (MDs) caused by altered expression of extracellular
   matrix (ECM) components, suggests that anti-oxidant therapeutic
   strategies might prove beneficial to laminopathic patients.

TI Hog1 bypasses stress-mediated down-regulation of transcription by RNA
   polymerase II redistribution and chromatin remodeling
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Cells are subjected to dramatic changes of gene expression
   upon environmental changes. Stress causes a general down-regulation of
   gene expression together with the induction of a set of
   stress-responsive genes. The p38-related stress-activated protein kinase
   Hog1 is an important regulator of transcription upon osmostress in
   yeast.
   Results: Genome-wide localization studies of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol
   II) and Hog1 showed that stress induced major changes in RNA Pol II
   localization, with a shift toward stress-responsive genes relative to
   housekeeping genes. RNA Pol II relocalization required Hog1, which was
   also localized to stress-responsive loci. In addition to RNA Pol
   II-bound genes, Hog1 also localized to RNA polymerase III-bound genes,
   pointing to a wider role for Hog1 in transcriptional control than
   initially expected. Interestingly, an increasing association of Hog1
   with stress-responsive genes was strongly correlated with chromatin
   remodeling and increased gene expression. Remarkably, MNase-Seq analysis
   showed that although chromatin structure was not significantly altered
   at a genome-wide level in response to stress, there was pronounced
   chromatin remodeling for those genes that displayed Hog1 association.
   Conclusion: Hog1 serves to bypass the general down-regulation of gene
   expression that occurs in response to osmostress, and does so both by
   targeting RNA Pol II machinery and by inducing chromatin remodeling at
   stress-responsive loci.

TI DOCA Sensitive Pendrin Expression in Kidney, Heart, Lung and Thyroid
   Tissues
SO CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Background/Aims: Pendrin (SLC26A4), a transporter accomplishing anion
   exchange, is expressed in inner ear, thyroid gland, kidneys, lung, liver
   and heart. Loss or reduction of function mutations of SLC26A4 underlie
   Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading to hearing loss with
   enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and
   goiter. Renal pendrin expression is up-regulated by mineralocorticoids
   such as aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone (DOCA). Little is known about
   the impact of mineralocorticoids on pendrin expression in extrarenal
   tissues. Methods: The present study utilized RT-qPCR and Western
   blotting to quantify the transcript levels and protein abundance of
   Slc26a4 in murine kidney, thyroid, heart and lung prior to and following
   subcutaneous administration of 100 mg/kg DOCA. Results: Slc26a4
   transcript levels as compared to Gapdh transcript levels were
   significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and
   thyroid. Accordingly pendrin protein expression was again significantly
   increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid.
   Conclusion: The observations reveal mineralocorticoid sensitivity of
   pendrin expression in kidney, heart, thyroid and lung. Copyright (c)

AB Background: Methylation of cytosine in DNA (5mC) is an important
   epigenetic mark that is involved in the regulation of genome function.
   During early embryonic development in mammals, the methylation landscape
   is dynamically reprogrammed in part through active demethylation. Recent
   advances have identified key players involved in active demethylation
   pathways, including oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
   and 5-formylcytosine (5fC) by the TET enzymes, and excision of 5fC by
   the base excision repair enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). Here, we
   provide the first genome-wide map of 5fC in mouse embryonic stem (ES)
   cells and evaluate potential roles for 5fC in differentiation.
   Results: Our method exploits the unique reactivity of 5fC for pulldown
   and high-throughput sequencing. Genome-wide mapping revealed 5fC
   enrichment in CpG islands (CGIs) of promoters and exons. CGI promoters
   in which 5fC was relatively more enriched than 5mC or 5hmC corresponded
   to transcriptionally active genes. Accordingly, 5fC-rich promoters had
   elevated H3K4me3 levels, associated with active transcription, and were
   frequently bound by RNA polymerase II. TDG down-regulation led to 5fC
   accumulation in CGIs in ES cells, which correlates with increased
   methylation in these genomic regions during differentiation of ES cells
   in wild-type and TDG knockout contexts.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that 5fC plays a role in
   epigenetic reprogramming within specific genomic regions, which is
   controlled in part by TDG-mediated excision. Notably, 5fC excision in ES
   cells is necessary for the correct establishment of CGI methylation
   patterns during differentiation and hence for appropriate patterns of
   gene expression during development.

TI Thyroid Cancer in Tuzla region of Bosnia and Herzegovina: A 10-year
   study (1999-2008)
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) is one of the Eastern European countries
   with lacking data on thyroid cancer (TC) epidemiology. We aimed to
   assess the incidence of TC in Tuzla Canton of B&H during a 10-year
   period (1999-2008). We retrospectively evaluated 65000 hospital records
   of both inpatients and outpatients with possible thyroid symptoms
   residing in Tuzla Canton of B&H (total of 496280 inhabitants) between
   1999 and 2008. Patients with histological proof of TC were included in
   study. Incidence rates were calculated with age standardisation using
   European standard population. Trends in incidence were evaluated as
   moving three-year averages. During observed period 117 patients met the
   diagnostic criteria for TC with male to female ratio of 1:4.85. Median
   age of all cases was 51 years (interquartile range: 41 to 60) with men
   in average 9 years older than women at the time of diagnosis. The mean
   annual standardized incidence was found to be 2.30/10(5) (%95 CI=
   1.38-3.22) inhabitants ranging from 1.0 to 3.2 per 10(5). The average
   crude incidence in men was 0.82/10(5) and 3.83/10(5) in women. The
   prevalence of TC, at the end of the observed period was found to be
   23.58/10(5) (%95 CI= 19.3-27.58). There is a slight decline of incidence
   in our region during the observed period, but with the increase in the
   latest years of the study. This increase is probably the result of
   combination of various factors, mainly the better detection of new cases
   due to wider availability of diagnostics. Based on depicted trends, we
   believe that in the future years, TC incidence in our region will
   continue to rise.

TI Effect of alloxan on ultrastructural and hormonal changes of the
   endocrine pancreas with hormonal profiles of adrenal gland and their
   influence on carbohydrate metabolism in soft-shelled turtles, Lissemys
   punctata punctata Bonnoterre
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB Alloxan action on B- and non-B-cells of the endocrine pancreas, adrenal
   gland and their influence on carbohydrate metabolism are not clearly
   understood in chelonians. Earlier findings were inconsistent and
   inexhaustive. These issues were investigated from cytological,
   ultrastructural, immunocytochemical (B cells) and hormonal (insulin)
   standpoints in soft-shelled turtles. Alloxan treatment (200 mg/kg body
   wt on alternate day for 6 days) significantly increased population of
   necrotic B-cells (87%) with decrease of healthy B-cell population, cell
   size and nuclear size, and increase of cell/nucleus (C/N) ratio.
   Ultrastructurally, B-cells were necrotic with extremely pycnotic
   nucleus, disorganized hypervacuolated cell cytoplasm, and indistinct,
   clustered secretory granules. The intensity of reaction of
   insulin-immunoreactive (insulin-IR) B cells and serum insulin level were
   drastically decreased. Alloxan also caused ultrastructural changes of
   A-cells, with hyperchromatic nucleus, clustered secretory granules and
   abundance of vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Population and size of A -cells
   were significantly declined without significant changes in necrotic cell
   population, nuclear size and C/N ratio. Alloxan partially increased
   necrotic D-cell population with decreased cell size and nuclear size,
   and increased population of healthy D-cells. Ultrastructurally, large
   vesicular structures and secretory granules, surrounded by peripheral
   halo were abundant. Small granule size was reduced with increase of its
   population and decrease of large granule population. Alloxan increased
   population of healthy PP-cells with increased cell and nuclear size.
   Granule size and population were altered in A-, D- and PP-cells after
   alloxan treatment. Adrenal corticosterone level was decreased with
   increased levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Liver glycogen level
   was declined with elevated level of serum glucose, but muscle glycogen
   level was increased with a fall in serum lactate level. Alloxan causes
   diabetes by inducing B-cell necrosis and also affects non - B cells of
   the endocrine pancreas. Alloxan also disturbs adrenal hormone production
   and affects carbohydrate metabolism in turtles.

TI Target therapies for radioiodine refractory advanced thyroid tumors
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
AB A small but not irrelevant percentage of differentiated thyroid cancers
   become refractory to radioiodine treatment either because they lose the
   ability of taking up iodine over the time or because, despite a
   persistent uptaking ability, the effect of the radioiodine is lost in
   terms of tumor burden reduction. These patients receive only few and
   transient benefits from other conventional therapies and particularly
   from chemotherapy. In the last decade, several new drugs have been
   discovered as potentially useful and tested in clinical trials. They are
   mainly represented by protein kinase inhibitor molecules that should be
   proposed to advanced and progressive 1311 refractory thyroid cancer
   patients by enrolling them in clinical trials or by the "off label" use

TI Expression of the Skeletal Calsequestrin Isoform in Normal and
   Regenerated Skeletal Muscles and in the Hearts of Rats With Altered
   Thyroid Status
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB We have investigated expression of skeletal calsequestrin (CSQ1) and
   fiber type composition in normal and regenerated fast and slow skeletal
   muscles and in the left heart ventricles of euthyroid (EU), hypothyroid
   (MY) and hyperthyroid (TH) adult inbred Lewis strain rats. The CSQ1
   level was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. CSQ1
   gene expression was assessed using reverse transcription and subsequent
   real time polymerase chain reaction. Muscle regeneration was achieved by
   intramuscular grafting of either soleus or extensor digitorum longus
   (EDL) from 3- to 4-week-old rats to either EDL or soleus muscle of
   2-month-old rats. The fiber type composition was assessed by a
   stereological method applied to stained muscle cross sections. We found
   that the protein and mRNA levels for CSQ1 were highest in the EDL
   muscle, the relative CSQ1 protein levels in the soleus muscle were two
   times lower and the transcript levels more than 5 times lower compared
   to the EDL. In the left heart ventricle, protein isoform and CSQ1
   transcript were also present, although at protein level, CSQ1 was hardly
   detectable. TH status increased and HY status decreased the expression
   of CSQ1 in the EDL, but its relative levels in the soleus and in the
   heart did not change. The regenerated soleus transplanted into EDL, as
   well as EDL transplanted into soleus exhibited protein and mRNA levels
   of CSQ1 corresponding to the host muscle and not to the graft source. TH
   status increased the percentages of the fastest 2X/D and 2B fibers at
   the expense of slow type 1 and fast 2A fibers in the EDL and that of
   fast 2A fibers in the soleus at the expense of slow type 1 fibers. HY
   status led to converse fiber type changes. We suggest that the observed
   changes in CSQ1 levels in TH and MY compared to EU rats can be related
   to fiber type changes caused by alteration of the thyroid status rather
   than to the direct effect of thyroid hormones on CSQ1 gene expression.

TI Non-genotoxic carcinogen exposure induces defined changes in the
   5-hydroxymethylome
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Induction and promotion of liver cancer by exposure to
   non-genotoxic carcinogens coincides with epigenetic perturbations,
   including specific changes in DNA methylation. Here we investigate the
   genome-wide dynamics of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a likely
   intermediate of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) demethylation in a DNA
   methylation reprogramming pathway. We use a rodent model of
   non-genotoxic carcinogen exposure using the drug phenobarbital.
   Results: Exposure to phenobarbital results in dynamic and reciprocal
   changes to the 5mC/5hmC patterns over the promoter regions of a cohort
   of genes that are transcriptionally upregulated. This reprogramming of
   5mC/5hmC coincides with characteristic changes in the histone marks
   H3K4me2, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. Quantitative analysis of
   phenobarbital-induced genes that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism
   reveals that both DNA modifications are lost at the transcription start
   site, while there is a reciprocal relationship between increasing levels
   of 5hmC and loss of 5mC at regions immediately adjacent to core
   promoters.
   Conclusions: Collectively, these experiments support the hypothesis that
   5hmC is a potential intermediate in a demethylation pathway and reveal
   precise perturbations of the mouse liver DNA methylome and
   hydroxymethylome upon exposure to a rodent hepatocarcinogen.

TI Tumour suppressor PTEN enhanced enzyme activity of GPx, SOD and catalase
   by suppression of PI3K/AKT pathway in non-small cell lung cancer cell
   lines
SO JOURNAL OF ENZYME INHIBITION AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Phosphates and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a
   tumour suppressor gene which dephosphorilates phosphoinositol 3,4,5
   triphosphates. Therefore PTEN can regulate PI3K/AKT pathway in cells.
   Because of promoter methylation or gene deletion, PTEN expression is
   commonly decreased or lost in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
   lines. Therefore, we hypothesized that PTEN could regulate the activity
   of superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and
   catalase. We first recreated PTENwt, G129R and G129E expressions in lung
   cell lines, in which endogenous PTEN expression was not detected. Then,
   we showed that PTEN could suppress AKT activity by its lipid phosphatase
   domain. We then examined the effect of recreated PTEN expressions in
   NSCLC cells. While PTENwt expression caused enhanced activity of SOD,
   GPx and catalase in transfected cells lines, neither G129R nor G129E
   expression effected enzyme activities. These results suggest that PTEN
   can up-regulate SOD, GPx and catalase activity by inhibition of PI3K/AKT
   pathway in NSCLC cell lines.

TI Peyer's patch-mediated intestinal immune system modulating activity of
   pectic-type polysaccharide from peel of Citrus unshiu
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB An intestinal immune system modulating polysaccharide (CUI-3IIb-3-2, 18
   kDa) was purified from Citrus unshiu peel. CUI-3IIb-3-2 mainly comprised
   GalA, GlcA, Ara, Gal and Rha, and it consisted of 4-linked GalA,
   terminal Araf, 4- or 5-linked/3,4- or 3,5-branched Ara, terminal Gal,
   and 2-linked/2,4-branched Rha. After CUI-3IIb-3-2 digestion by
   endo-alpha-D-(1 -> 4)-polygalacturonase, its hydrolysate was
   fractionated into PG-1 and PG-2. Methylation analyses of PG-1 and PG-2
   using base-catalysed beta-elimination suggested that CUI-3IIb-3-2 be
   assumed as pectic-type polysaccharide. Since the activities of PG-1 and
   PG-2 were potently decreased, the whole polysaccharide structure of
   CUI-3IIb-3-2 would be essential to maintain the activity. Meanwhile,
   when CUI-3IIb was orally administered in mice, bone marrow cell
   proliferation and GM-CSF/IL-6 production from Peyer's patch cell were
   significantly higher (1.76- and 2.03/2.51-fold, respectively) than a
   saline. Therefore, a pectic-type polysaccharide from citrus peel could
   stimulate Peyer's patches and produce hematopoietic growth factors
   resulted in bone marrow cell proliferation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Effectiveness of preoperative plasmapheresis in a pregnancy complicated
   by hyperthyroidism and anti-thyroid drug-associated angioedema
SO GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Hyperthyroidism is not a rare entity in pregnancy and 85% of these cases
   attributed to Graves' disease (GD). There is no therapeutic modality for
   GD considered as totally safe in pregnancy. Fetal and neonatal risks of
   maternal hyperthyroid disease are related to the hyperthyroidism itself
   and/or to the medical treatment of the disease. There are no data
   supporting an association between congenital anomalies in the fetus and
   propylthiouracil (PTU). Hepatotoxicity, cytopenias - especially
   agranulocytosis and quite rarely, angioedema, may be seen as side
   effects of PTU. In this case report, we examine an instance of Graves'
   hyperthyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy. In this case, a serious side
   effect during antithyroid drug usage was encountered, eventually
   resulting in surgery in the second trimester. This intervention was
   assisted by the use of plasmapheresis to obtain rapid normalization of
   serum thyroid hormone levels.

TI Distinct Chromatin Configurations Regulate the Initiation and the
   Maintenance of hGH Gene Expression
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB For many mammalian genes, initiation of transcription during embryonic
   development must be subsequently sustained over extensive periods of
   adult life. It remains unclear whether maintenance of gene expression
   reflects the same set of pathways as are involved in initial gene
   activation. The human pituitary growth hormone (hGH-N) locus is
   activated in the differentiating somatotrope midway through
   embryogenesis by a multicomponent locus control region (LCR). DNase
   I-hypersensitive site I (HSI) of the LCR is essential to full
   developmental activation of the hGH-N locus. Here we demonstrate that
   conditional deletion of HSI from the active hGH locus in the adult
   pituitary effectively silences hGH-N expression. Analyses of chromatin
   structure and locus positioning demonstrate that a specific subset of
   the HSI functions active in the embryo retain their HSI dependence in
   the adult pituitary. These functions sustain engagement of the hGH locus
   with polymerase II (Pol II) factories, histone acetylation at the hGH-N
   promoter, and looping of the LCR to its target promoter. These data
   reveal that HSI is essential to both the maintenance and the initiation
   phases of gene expression. These observations contribute to our
   mechanistic understanding of how stable patterns of mammalian gene
   expression are established in a terminally differentiated cell.

TI The Drosophila Ortholog of MLL3 and MLL4, trithorax related, Functions
   as a Negative Regulator of Tissue Growth
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB The human MLL genes (MLL1 to MLL4) and their Drosophila orthologs,
   trithorax (trx) and trithorax related (trr), encode proteins capable of
   methylating histone H3 on lysine 4. MLL1 and MLL2 are most similar to
   trx, while MLL3 and MLL4 are more closely related to trr. Several MLL
   genes are mutated in human cancers, but how these proteins regulate cell
   proliferation is not known. Here we show that trr mutant cells have a
   growth advantage over their wild-type neighbors and display changes in
   the levels of multiple proteins that regulate growth and cell division,
   including Notch, Capicua, and cyclin B. trr mutant clones display
   markedly reduced levels of H3K4 monomethylation without obvious changes
   in the levels of H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The trr mutant phenotype
   resembles that of Utx, which encodes a H3K27 demethylase, consistent
   with the observation that Trr and Utx are found in the same protein
   complex. In contrast to the overgrowth displayed by trr mutant tissue,
   trx clones are un-derrepresented, express low levels of the
   antiapoptotic protein Diap1, and exhibit only modest changes in global
   levels of H3K4 methylation. Thus, in Drosophila eye imaginal discs, Trr,
   likely functioning together with Utx, restricts tissue growth. In
   contrast, Trx appears to promote cell survival.

TI Biological determinants of health disparities in prostate cancer
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
AB Purpose of review
   Prostate cancer mortality rates are highest among men of African
   ancestry in the United States and globally. Environmental exposures and
   ancestry-related factors may influence tumor biology and induce a more
   aggressive disease in this population. Here, we summarize the most
   recent advances in our understanding of race/ethnic differences in the
   tumor biology of prostate cancer with an emphasis on the excess disease
   burden among African-Americans.
   Recent findings
   Results from several DNA methylation studies showed an increased
   prevalence in DNA hypermethylation at disease-related loci in tumors
   from African-American patients compared with tumors from
   European-American patients. Analyses of genome-wide gene expression in
   prostate tumors revealed frequent alterations in the expression of genes
   related to immunobiology among the African-American patients, consistent
   with immune response differences between them and their
   European-American counterparts. Lastly, population differences in the
   frequency of oncogenic erythroblast transformation-specific family of
   transcription factors (ETS)-related gene rearrangements were evaluated
   in three studies that showed that these alterations manifest themselves
   most commonly in tumors from men of European ancestry, but are
   significantly less frequent in men of African ancestry, whereas least
   common in men of Asian ancestry.
   Summary
   Analysis of tumor markers indicates that tumor biological differences
   may exist between prostate cancer patients of African ancestry and those
   of European or Asian ancestry. These differences could affect disease
   aggressiveness and response to therapy.

TI Novel water-soluble Tc-99m(I)/Re(I)-porphyrin conjugates as potential
   multimodal agents for molecular imaging
SO JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The synthesis and characterization of two novel water soluble porphyrins
   with three meso pyridyl rings and one peripheral chelator - either a
   diethylenetriamine unit (4) or a bipyridyl fragment (8) - for binding to
   the {Tc-99m(CO)(3)}(+) moiety is reported. In 8, despite the presence of
   a flexible and hydrophilic PEG-like linker that connects the bpy unit to
   the macrocycle, good water solubility was only obtained by methylation
   of the pyridyl N atoms that provided three extra positive charges.
   Furthermore, the water-soluble conjugates of 4 and 8 with either one
   fac-{Re(CO)(3)}(+) (9 and 10, respectively) or one
   fac-{Tc-99m(CO)(3)}(+) fragment (9a and 10a, respectively) are

TI Efficacy of decitabine-loaded nanogels in overcoming cancer drug
   resistance is mediated via sustained DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
   depletion
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) promotes DNA methylation to maintain
   cancer drug resistance. The epigenetic drug, decitabine (DAC) is a
   potent hypomethylating agent, but its effect is transient because of its
   instability. We tested the efficacy of DAC-loaded nanogels in
   doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells, DAC-resistant melanoma cells,
   and leukemia cells. DAC in nanogel sustained DNMT1 depletion, prolonged
   cell arrest in the G2/M cell-cycle phase, and significantly enhanced
   antiproliferative effect of DAC. The efficacy of DAC-loaded nanogels was
   more significant in resistant than sensitive cells. Our data suggest
   that effective delivery of DAC and prolonged DNMT1 depletion are
   critical to overcoming drug resistance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   (Mont.) Singer
SO CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH
AB An immunostimulating water-soluble heteroglycan (PS-II) was isolated
   from an aqueous extract of the fruit bodies of a hybrid mushroom, pfls1h
   produced by intergeneric protoplast fusion between Pleurotus florida and
   Lentinus squarrosulus (Mont.) Singer. Structural characterization of
   PS-II was carried out using sugar analysis, methylation experiment,
   periodate oxidation and 1D/2D NMR studies. Sugar analysis indicated the
   presence of glucose, mannose and galactose in a molar ratio of 1:1:2.
   Methylation analysis revealed that PS-II was composed of (1 -> 6)- and
   (1 -> 2,4,6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl, terminal beta-D-mannopyranosyl
   and terminal beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues in a relative proportion of
   approximately 1:1:1:1. On the basis of chemical analysis and NMR
   studies, the structure of the repeating unit of the heteroglycan was
   established to consist of a backbone chain of two (1 ->
   6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residues, one of which is branched at O-2
   with terminal beta-D-Manp and at O-4 with terminal beta-D-Glcp. This
   heteroglycan (PS-II) showed in vitro splenocyte, thymocyte and
   macrophage activations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A high-molecular mass polysaccharide fraction was obtained by mild acid
   hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharide of diazotrophic rhizobacterium
   Azospirillum brasilense SR80 followed by GPC on Sephadex G-50 Superfine.
   Studies by composition and methylation analyses, Smith degradation, and

TI Involvement of Src and the actin cytoskeleton in the antitumorigenic
   action of adenosine dialdehyde
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB Trans methylation is an important reaction that transfers a methyl group
   in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to substrates such as DNA, RNA, and
   proteins. It is known that transmethylation plays critical roles in
   various cellular responses. In this study, we examined the effects of
   transmethylation on tumorigenic responses and its regulatory mechanism
   using an upregulation strategy of adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) acting as a
   negative feedback inhibitor. Treatment with adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx),
   an inhibitor of transmethylation-suppressive adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
   hydrolase (SAHH), enhanced the level of SAH and effectively blocked the
   proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells; the treatment
   also induced the differentiation of C6 glioma cells and suppressed the
   neovascular genesis of eggs in a dose-dependent manner. Through
   immunoblotting analysis, it was found that AdOx was capable of
   indirectly diminishing the phosphorylation of oncogenic Src and its
   kinase activity. Interestingly, AdOx disrupted actin cytoskeleton
   structures, leading to morphological changes, and suppressed the
   formation of a signaling complex composed of Src and p85/PI3K, which is
   linked to various tumorigenic responses. In agreement with these data,
   the exogenous treatment of SAH or inhibition of SAHH by specific siRNA
   or another type of inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine (DAZA), similarly
   resulted in antitumorigenic responses, suppressive activity on Src, the
   alteration of actin cytoskeleton, and a change of the colocalization
   pattern between actin and Src. Taken together, these results suggest
   that SAH/SAHH-mediated transmethylation could be linked to the
   tumorigenic processes through cross-regulation between the actin
   cytoskeleton and Src kinase activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Toxocara canis: Molecular basis of immune recognition and evasion
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB Toxocara canis has extraordinary abilities to survive for many years in
   the tissues of diverse vertebrate species, as well as to develop to
   maturity in the intestinal tract of its definitive canid host. Human
   disease is caused by larval stages invading musculature, brain and the
   eye, and immune mechanisms appear to be ineffective at eliminating the
   infection. Survival of T. canis larvae can be attributed to two
   molecular strategies evolved by the parasite. Firstly, it releases
   quantities of 'excretory-secretory' products which include lectins,
   mucins and enzymes that interact with and modulate host immunity. For
   example, one lectin (CTL-1) is very similar to mammalian lectins,
   required for tissue inflammation, suggesting that T. canis may interfere
   with leucocyte extravasation into infected sites. The second strategy is
   the elaboration of a specialised mucin-rich surface coat; this is
   loosely attached to the parasite epicuticle in a fashion that permits
   rapid escape when host antibodies and cells adhere, resulting in an
   inflammatory reaction around a newly vacated focus. The mucins have been
   characterised as bearing multiple glycan side-chains, consisting of a
   blood-group-like trisaccharide with one or two O-methylation
   modifications. Both the lectins and these trisaccharides are targeted by
   host antibodies, with anti-lectin antibodies showing particular
   diagnostic promise. Antibodies to the mono-methylated trisaccharide
   appear to be T. canis-specific, as this epitope is not found in the
   closely related Toxocara cati, but all other antigenic determinants are
   very similar between the two species. This distinction may be important
   in designing new and more accurate diagnostic tests. Further tools to
   control toxocariasis could also arise from understanding the molecular
   cues and steps involved in larval development. In vitro-cultivated
   larvae express high levels of four mRNAs that are translationally
   silenced, as the proteins they encode are not detectable in cultured
   larvae. However, these appear to be produced once the parasite has
   entered the mammalian host, as they are recognised by specific
   antibodies in infected patients. Elucidating the function of these
   genes, or analysing if micro-RNA translational silencing suppresses
   production of the proteins, may point towards new drug targets for
   tissue-phase parasites in humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Zinc protects HepG2 cells against the oxidative damage and DNA damage
   induced by ochratoxin A
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Oxidative stress and DNA damage are the most studied mechanisms by which
   ochratoxin A (OTA) induces its toxic effects, which include
   nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity and genotoxicity. Zinc,
   which is an essential trace element, is considered a potential
   antioxidant. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether zinc
   supplement could inhibit OTA-induced oxidative damage and DNA damage in
   HepG2 cells and the mechanism of inhibition. The results indicated that
   that exposure of OTA decreased the intracellular zinc concentration;
   zinc supplement significantly reduced the OTA-induced production of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   activity but did not affect the OTA-induced decrease in the
   mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)). Meanwhile, the addition
   of the zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine
   (TPEN) strongly aggravated the OTA-induced oxidative damage. This study
   also demonstrated that zinc helped to maintain the integrity of DNA
   through the reduction of OTA-induced DNA strand breaks,
   8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation and DNA hypomethylation.
   OTA increased the mRNA expression of metallothionein1-A (MT1A),
   metallothionein2-A (MT2A) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Zinc
   supplement further enhanced the mRNA expression of MT1A and MT2A, but it
   had no effect on the mRNA expression of SOD1 and catalase (CAT). Zinc
   was for the first time proven to reduce the cytotoxicity of OTA through
   inhibiting the oxidative damage and DNA damage, and regulating the
   expression of zinc-associated genes. Thus, the addition of zinc can
   potentially be used to reduce the OTA toxicity of contaminated feeds.

TI Putative tumour suppressor gene necdin is hypermethylated and mutated in
   human cancer
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Background: Necdin (NDN) expression is downregulated in
   telomerase-immortalised normal human urothelial cells.
   Telomerase-immortalised normal human urothelial cells have no detected
   genetic alterations. Accordingly, many of the genes whose expression is
   altered following immortalisation are those for which epigenetic
   silencing is reported.
   Methods: NDN expression was examined in normal tissues and tumour cell
   lines by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting.
   Immunohistochemistry was performed on urothelial carcinoma (UC).
   Urothelial carcinoma and UC cell lines were subject to
   HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Array-based methylation analyses. Mutation
   screening was performed. The functional significance of NDN expression
   was investigated using retroviral-mediated downregulation or
   overexpression.
   Results: NDN protein was widely expressed in normal tissues. Loss of
   expression was observed in 38 out of 44 (86%) of UC cell lines and 19
   out of 25 (76%) of non-UC cell lines. Loss of NDN protein was found in
   the majority of primary UC. Oncomine analysis demonstrated
   downregulation of expression in multiple tumour types. In UC,
   tumour-specific hypermethylation of NDN and key CpG sites where
   hypermethylation correlated with reduced expression were identified. Six
   novel mutations, including some of predicted functional significance,
   were identified in colorectal and ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional
   studies showed that NDN could suppress colony formation at low cell
   density and affect anchorage-independent growth and anoikis in vitro.
   Conclusion: NDN is a novel tumour suppressor candidate that is
   downregulated and hypermethylated or mutated in cancer.

TI Gestational doxorubicin alters fetal thyroid-brain axis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Administration of chemotherapy during pregnancy may represent a big risk
   factor for the developing brain, therefore we studied whether the
   transplacental transport of doxorubicin (DOX) may affect the development
   of neuroendocrine system. DOX (25 mg/kg; 3 times
   interaperitoneally/week) was given to pregnant rats during whole
   gestation period. The disturbances in neuroendocrine functions were
   investigated at gestation day (GD) 15 and 20 by following the maternal
   and fetal thyroid hormone levels, fetal nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP)
   levels and adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase
   and Mg(2+)-ATPase) activities in two brain regions, cerebrum and
   cerebellum. In control group, the levels of maternal and fetal serum
   thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyrotropin (TSH), and fetal
   serum growth hormone (GH) increased from days 15 to 20, whereas in the
   DOX group, a decrease in maternal and fetal T4, T3 and increase in TSH
   levels (hypothyroid status) were observed. Also, the levels of fetal GH
   decreased continuously from GD 15 to 20 with respect to control group.
   In cerebrum and cerebellum, the levels of fetal nucleotides and the
   activities of fetal ATPases in control group followed a synchronized
   course of development. The fetal hypothyroidism due to maternal
   administration of DOX decreased the levels of nucleotides, ATPases
   activities, and total adenylate, instead, the adenylate energy charge
   showed a trend to an increase in both brain regions at all ages tested.
   These alterations were dose- and age-dependent and this, in turn, may
   impair the nerve transmission. Finally, DOX may act as neuroendocrine
   disruptor causing hypothyroidism and fetal brain energetic dysfunction.

TI CHD6, a Cellular Repressor of Influenza Virus Replication, Is Degraded
   in Human Alveolar Epithelial Cells and Mice Lungs during Infection
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The influenza virus polymerase associates to an important number of
   transcription-related proteins, including the largest subunit of the RNA
   polymerase II complex (RNAP II). Despite this association, degradation
   of the RNAP II takes place in the infected cells once viral
   transcription is completed. We have previously shown that the chromatin
   remodeler CHD6 protein interacts with the influenza virus polymerase
   complex, represses viral replication, and relocalizes to inactive
   chromatin during influenza virus infection. In this paper, we report
   that CHD6 acts as a negative modulator of the influenza virus polymerase
   activity and is also subjected to degradation through a process that
   includes the following characteristics: (i) the cellular proteasome is
   not implicated, (ii) the sole expression of the three viral polymerase
   subunits from its cloned cDNAs is sufficient to induce proteolysis, and
   (iii) degradation is also observed in vivo in lungs of infected mice and
   correlates with the increase of viral titers in the lungs. Collectively,
   the data indicate that CHD6 degradation is a general effect exerted by
   influenza A viruses and suggest that this viral repressor may play an
   important inhibitory role since degradation and accumulation into
   inactive chromatin occur during the infection.

TI Lipopolysaccharide induces epididymal and testicular antimicrobial gene
   expression in vitro: insights into the epigenetic regulation of
   sperm-associated antigen 11e gene
SO IMMUNOGENETICS
AB Infections of the male reproductive tract lead to infertility, and the
   molecular mechanisms that operate under these conditions are not well
   studied. Using epididymal and testicular tissues cultured in vitro, we
   demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the mRNA expression of
   beta-defensins, Spag11s, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the rat
   caput, cauda, and testes. LPS-induced antimicrobial gene expression
   involved NF-kB activation and decreased levels of histone deacetylase 1
   (HDAC1) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), all of which possibly allow
   antimicrobial gene transcription. Inhibition of endogenous HDAC1 and
   DNMT1 resulted in higher antimicrobial gene expression when compared to
   the LPS alone treated conditions. Increased trimethylation of histone 3,
   its binding to the upstream region of Spag11e gene, and demethylation of
   this region were observed during endotoxin challenge. We demonstrate
   that antimicrobial gene expression in the male reproductive tract
   tissues during endotoxin challenge involves NF-kB activation and
   epigenetic changes.

TI Epigenetic Regulation of Nestin Expression During Neurogenic
   Differentiation of Adipose Tissue Stem Cells
SO STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) have received considerable
   attention due to their easy access, expansion potential, and
   differentiation capacity. ASCs are believed to have the potential to
   differentiate into neurons. However, the mechanisms by which this may
   occur remain largely unknown. Here, we show that culturing ASCs under
   active proliferation conditions greatly improves their propensity to
   differentiate toward osteogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic lineages.
   Neurogenic-induced ASCs express early neurogenic genes as well as
   markers of mature neurons, including voltage-gated ion channels. Nestin,
   highly expressed in neural progenitors, is upregulated by mitogenic
   stimulation of ASCs, and as in neural progenitors, then repressed during
   neurogenic differentiation. Nestin gene (NES) expression under these
   conditions appears to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. The
   neural-specific, but not muscle-specific, enhancer regions of NES are
   DNA demethylated by mitogenic stimulation, and remethylated upon
   neurogenic differentiation. We observe dynamic changes in histone H3K4,
   H3K9, and H3K27 methylation on the NES locus before and during
   neurogenic differentiation that are consistent with epigenetic processes
   involved in the regulation of NES expression. We suggest that ASCs are
   epigenetically prepatterned to differentiate toward a neural lineage and
   that this prepatterning is enhanced by demethylation of critical NES
   enhancer elements upon mitogenic stimulation preceding neurogenic
   differentiation. Our findings provide molecular evidence that the
   differentiation repertoire of ASCs may extend beyond mesodermal
   lineages.

TI Differential in vitro and cellular effects of iron chelators for hypoxia
   inducible factor hydroxylases
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), an essential transcriptional factor,
   is negatively regulated by two different types of oxygen and
   Fe2+-dependent HIF hydroxylases, proline hydroxylase (PHD) and factor
   inhibiting HIF (FIH), under normoxia. Iron chelators have therefore been
   used for inducing HIF-1 expression by inhibiting the hydroxylases. In
   this study, the iron chelators displayed differential effects for PHD
   and FIH in cells depending on their iron specificity and membrane
   permeability rather than their in vitro potencies. The membrane
   permeability of the strict Fe2+-chelator potentially inhibited both
   hydroxylases, whereas the membrane impermeable one showed no inhibitory
   effect in cells. In contrast, the depletion of the extracellular Fe3+
   ion was mainly correlated to PHD inhibition, and the membrane permeable
   one elicited low efficacy for both enzymes in cells. The 3-hydroxyl
   group of quercetin, a natural flavonoid, was critical for inhibition of
   intracellular hydroxylases. Since the 3-methylation of quercetin is
   induced by catechol-O-methyl transferase, the enzyme may regulate the
   intracellular activity of quercetin. These data suggest that the
   multiple factors of iron-chelators may be responsible for regulating the
   intracellular activity HIF hydroxylases. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 864873,

TI Circannual Variation in Thyroid Hormone Deiodinases in a Short-Day
   Breeder
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB At temperate latitudes, many mammals and birds show internally timed,
   long-term changes in seasonal physiology, synchronised to the seasons by
   changing day length (photoperiod). Photoperiodic control of thyroid
   hormone levels in the hypothalamus dictates the timing. This is effected
   through reciprocal regulation of thyroid hormone deiodinase gene
   expression. The local synthesis of type 2 deiodinase (Dio2) promotes
   triiodothyronine (T3) production and summer biology, whereas type 3
   deiodinase (Dio3) promotes T3 degradation and winter biology. In the
   present study, we investigated the extent to which the hypothalamic
   expression of Dio2 and Dio3 is circannually regulated in the Soay sheep,
   a short-day breeding mammal. Male sheep were exposed to a long
   photoperiod (LP; 16:24h light/dark cycle) or a short photoperiod (SP;
   8:24h light/dark cycle), for up to 28weeks to establish four different
   endocrine states: (i) LP animals in a spring/summer-like state of
   reproductive arrest; (ii) LP refractory (LPR) animals showing
   spontaneous reproductive reactivation; (iii) SP animals showing
   autumn/winter-like reproductive activation; and (iv) SP refractory (SPR)
   animals showing spontaneous reproductive arrest. A complex pattern of
   hypothalamic Dio2 and Dio3 expression was observed, revealing
   distinctive photoperiod-driven and internally timed effects for both
   genes. The patterns of expression differed both spatially and
   temporally, with phases of peak Dio2 expression in the median eminence
   and tuberoinfundibular sulcus, as well as in the paraventricular zone
   (PVZ) (maximal under LP), whereas Dio3 expression was always confined to
   the PVZ (maximal under SP). These effects likely reflect the distinct
   roles of these enzymes in the localised control of hypothalamic T3
   levels. The spontaneous decline in Dio2 and spontaneous increase in Dio3
   in LPR animals occurred with a corresponding decline in
   thyroid-stimulating hormone expression in the neighbouring pars
   tuberalis (PT), although this relationship did not hold for the
   corresponding Dio2 increase/Dio3 decrease seen in SPR animals. We
   conclude that internally timed and spatially regulated changes in Dio2
   and Dio3 expression may drive the cycling between breeding and
   nonbreeding states in long-lived seasonal species, and may be either
   PT-dependent or PT-independent at different phases of the circannual
   cycle.

TI Ethosuximide reduces epileptogenesis and behavioral comorbidity in the
   GAERS model of genetic generalized epilepsy
SO EPILEPSIA
AB Purpose Ethosuximide (ESX) is a drug of choice for the symptomatic
   treatment of absence seizures. Chronic treatment with ESX has been
   reported to have disease-modifying antiepileptogenic activity in the
   WAG/Rij rat model of genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) with absence
   seizures. Here we examined whether chronic treatment with ESX (1)
   possesses antiepileptogenic effects in the genetic absence epilepsy rats
   from Strasbourg (GAERS) model of GGE, (2) is associated with a
   mitigation of behavioral comorbidities, and (3) influences gene
   expression in the somatosensory cortex region where seizures are thought
   to originate. Methods GAERS and nonepileptic control (NEC) rats were
   chronically treated with ESX (in drinking water) or control (tap water)
   from 3 to 22weeks of age. Subsequently, all animals received tap water
   only for another 12weeks to assess enduring effects of treatment.
   Seizure frequency and anxiety-like behaviors were serially assessed
   throughout the experimental paradigm. Treatment effects on the
   expression of key components of the epigenetic molecular machinery, the
   DNA methyltransferase enzymes, were assessed using quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Key Findings ESX treatment
   significantly reduced seizures in GAERS during the treatment phase, and
   this effect was maintained during the 12-week posttreatment phase
   (p<0.05). Furthermore, the anxiety-like behaviors present in GAERS were
   reduced by ESX treatment (p<0.05). Molecular analysis revealed that ESX
   treatment was associated with increased expression of DNA
   methyltransferase enzyme messenger RNA (mRNA) in cortex. Significance
   Chronic ESX treatment has disease-modifying effects in the GAERS model
   of GGE, with antiepileptogenic effects against absence seizures and
   mitigation of behavioral comorbidities. The cellular mechanism for these
   effects may involve epigenetic modifications.

TI Developmental and androgenic regulation of chromatin regulators EZH2 and
   ANCCA/ATAD2 in the prostate Via MLL histone methylase complex
SO PROSTATE
AB BACKGROUND Chromatin regulators ANCCA and EZH2 are overexpressed in
   prostate cancer and play crucial roles in androgen-stimulated and
   castration-refractory prostate tumor growth and survival. However, how
   their expression is regulated in the tumors and whether they play a role
   in prostate development remains unclear. METHODS Prostate tissue from
   different developmental stages of mouse and human were examined by IHC,
   qRT-PCR and Western for expression of ANCCA, EZH2, and Ki-67. Animals
   were castrated and T-implanted for the expression response in normal
   prostate and tumors. siRNA knockdown and ChIP were performed for the
   mechanism of ANCCA regulation of EZH2. RESULTS In contrast to their very
   low level expression in adult prostate, ANCCA and EZH2 are strongly
   expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme of mouse and human UGS. Their
   expression becomes more restricted to epithelial cells during later
   development and displays a second peak during puberty, which correlates
   with the proliferative status of the epithelium. Importantly, their
   expression in normal prostate and tumors is strongly suppressed by
   castration and markedly induced by testosterone replacement. While
   androgen suppresses EZH2 in CRPC cells, in LNCaP cells, physiological
   concentrations of androgen stimulate expression of PRC2 genes (EZH2,
   SUZ12, and EED), which is mediated by androgen-induced ANCCA and
   involves E2F and histone H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 complex. CONCLUSION EZH2
   and ANCCA are androgen regulated and strongly expressed in early
   prostate morphogenesis and during puberty, suggesting their important
   role in prostate development. Regulation of EZH2 by ANCCA emphasizes
   bromodomain protein ANCCA as a potential therapeutic target against
   prostate cancer. Prostate 73: 455466, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

TI Partial reductions in mechanical loading yield proportional changes in
   bone density, bone architecture, and muscle mass
SO JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH
AB Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes
   in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional
   adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We
   investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading
   using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point
   harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while
   maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6
   mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of
   body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included
   for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing.
   Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing,
   and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS,
   bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of
   unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density,
   calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and
   cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the
   degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight
   bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle
   atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than
   HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical
   stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the
   PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced,
   long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes
   in muscle and bone of the hindlimb. (c) 2012 American Society for Bone

TI Polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene and risk of autoimmune
   thyroid diseases: a meta-analysis
SO ENDOCRINE
AB Environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved in the
   pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), which include
   Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Polymorphisms of vitamin D
   receptor (VDR) were implicated in AITDs risk. To date, many studies have
   evaluated the association between a functional polymorphism in the VDR
   gene and AITDs risk; however, the result is still ambiguous and
   inconclusive. To address the association of VDR gene FokI (rs10735810),
   TaqI (rs731236), BsmI (rs1544410), and ApaI (rs7975232) polymorphisms
   with AITD risk by meta-analysis. By searching the relevant literature, a
   total of eight studies were identified and meta-analyzed. HWE for each
   study are checked. Crude odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals
   (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association in the allele
   polymorphism, codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model. The
   result indicates that the BsmI or TaqI polymorphisms is significantly
   associated with AITD risk (OR = 0.801 95 % CI 0.705, 0.910, Pz = 0.001
   for B vs. b; OR = 0.854, 95 % CI 0.757, 0.963, Pz = 0.010 for t vs. T),
   while the ApaI or FokI polymorphism do not. In the subgroup analysis in
   Europeans, the decreased risk of AITD remained for the B or t variant.
   This gene-based analysis indicates that, based on current evidence from
   published studies, the cumulative effect of BsmI or TaqI polymorphisms
   in VDR is significantly associated with AITD.

TI Hybrid Detectors Improved Time-Lapse Confocal Microscopy of PML and
   53BP1 Nuclear Body Colocalization in DNA Lesions
SO MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS
AB We used hybrid detectors (HyDs) to monitor the trajectories and
   interactions of promyelocytic leukemia (GFP-PML) nuclear bodies (NBs)
   and mCherry-53BP1-positive DNA lesions. 53BP1 protein accumulates in NBs
   that occur spontaneously in the genome or in gamma-irradiation-induced
   foci. When we induced local DNA damage by ultraviolet irradiation, we
   also observed accumulation of 53BP1 proteins into discrete bodies,
   instead of the expected dispersed pattern. In comparison with
   photomultiplier tubes, which are used for standard analysis by confocal
   laser scanning microscopy, HyDs significantly eliminated photobleaching
   of GFP and mCherry fluorochromes during image acquisition. The low laser
   intensities used for HyD-based confocal analysis enabled us to observe
   NBs for the longer time periods, necessary for studies of the
   trajectories and interactions of PML and 53BP1 NBs. To further
   characterize protein interactions, we used resonance scanning and a
   novel bioinformatics approach to register and analyze the movements of
   individual PML and 53BP1 NBs. The combination of improved HyD-based
   confocal microscopy with a tailored bioinformatics approach enabled us
   to reveal damage-specific properties of PML and 53BP1 NBs.

TI Coordination of hypothalamic and pituitary T3 production regulates TSH
   expression
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Type II deiodinase (D2) activates thyroid hormone by converting
   thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3). This allows plasma T4 to
   signal a negative feedback loop that inhibits production of
   thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH)
   and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the pituitary. To determine the
   relative contributions of these D2 pathways in the feedback loop, we
   developed 2 mouse strains with pituitary- and astrocyte-specific D2
   knockdown (pit-D2 KO and astro-D2 KO mice, respectively). The pit-D2 KO
   mice had normal serum T3 and were systemically euthyroid, but exhibited
   an approximately 3-fold elevation in serum TSH levels and a 40%
   reduction in biological activity. This was the result of elevated serum
   T4 that increased D2-mediated T3 production in the MBH, thus decreasing
   Trh mRNA. That tanycytes, not astrocytes, are the cells within the MBH
   that mediate T4-to-T3 conversion was defined by studies using the
   astro-D2 KO mice. Despite near-complete loss of brain D2, tanycyte D2
   was preserved in astro-D2 KO mice at levels that were sufficient to
   maintain both the T4-dependent negative feedback loop and thyroid
   economy. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the
   hypothalamic-thyroid axis is wired to maintain normal plasma T3 levels,
   which is achieved through coordination of T4-to-T3 conversion between
   thyrotrophs and tanycytes.

TI Seminal and molecular evidence that sauna exposure affects human
   spermatogenesis
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB What are the effects of continuous sauna exposure on seminal parameters,
   sperm chromatin, sperm apoptosis and expression of genes involved in
   heat stress and hypoxia?
   Scrotal hyperthermia by exposure to sauna can induce a significant
   alteration of spermatogenesis.
   Several authors have evidenced that high temperature has dramatic
   effects on spermatogenesis.
   A longitudinal time-course study. Data from 10 subjects exposed to
   Finnish sauna were collected before sauna (T0), after3 months of sauna
   sessions (T1) and after 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3) from the end of sauna
   exposure.
   Ten normozoospermic volunteers underwent two sauna sessions per week for
   3 months, at 8090C, each lasting 15 min. Sex hormones, sperm parameters,
   sperm chromatin structure, sperm apoptosis and expression of genes
   involved in heat stress and hypoxia were evaluated at the start, at the
   end of sauna exposure and after 3 and 6 months from sauna
   discontinuation. Students t-test for paired data was used for
   statistical analysis.
   At the end of sauna exposure, we found a strong impairment of sperm
   count and motility (P 0.001), while no significant change in sex
   hormones was present. Decreases in the percentage of sperm with normal
   histone-protamine substitution (78.7 4.5 versus 69.0 4.1), chromatin
   condensation (70.7 4.7 versus 63.6 3.3) and mitochondrial function (76.8
   4.9 versus 54.0 6.1) were also evident at T1, and strong parallel
   up-regulation of genes involved in response to heat stress and hypoxia
   was found. All these effects were completely reversed at T3.
   Absence of subjects with abnormal sperm parameters was the major
   limitation of this study.
   Our data demonstrated for the first time that in normozoospermic
   subjects, sauna exposure induces a significant but reversible impairment
   of spermatogenesis, including alteration of sperm parameters,
   mitochondrial function and sperm DNA packaging. The large use of Finnish
   sauna in Nordic countries and its growing use in other parts of the
   world make it important to consider the impact of this lifestyle choice
   on mens fertility.
   No external funding was sought for this study and the authors have no
   conflict of interest to declare.

TI Loss of Estrogen Receptor Beta Expression in Follicular Thyroid
   Carcinoma Predicts Poor Outcome
SO THYROID
AB Background: Well-differentiated follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs)
   usually act indolently, while aggressively acting tumors are difficult
   to detect early enough. Estrogen receptors (ERs) have prognostic
   significance in many cancers. Thyroid diseases, including neoplasms, are
   associated with the female sex. The prognostic significance of ERs in
   FTCs has not been reported previously.
   Methods: We studied the role of ER alpha and ER beta in 83 cases of
   follicular thyroid adenomas (FTA) and 43 FTC cases, including seven
   cases of poorly differentiated FTC, obtained from the Department of
   Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1990 and 2009.
   Patient follow-up was conducted until March 2011. Expression of ER
   alpha, ER beta, and MIB-1/Ki-67 was investigated by immunohistochemistry
   and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics, including
   survival.
   Results: Two major observations were apparent. First, ER beta expression
   was significantly higher in FTA than in FTC, and it was a stronger
   differential diagnostic marker than MIB-1/Ki-67. Second, low ER beta
   expression correlated with poor survival in FTC. All cancer-specific
   deaths due to FTC were among low ER beta-score patients.
   Conclusion: ER beta is a differential marker for malignancy and could
   thus be used as a preoperative tool. FTC patients with a low ER beta
   score need more thorough follow-up and may benefit from more aggressive
   treatment.

TI DC-SCRIPT Regulates Glucocorticoid Receptor Function and Expression of
   Its Target GILZ in Dendritic Cells
SO JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immune system; they can
   induce immunity or tolerance depending on diverse factors in the DC
   environment. Pathogens, but also tissue damage, hormones, and vitamins,
   affect DC activation and maturation. In particular, glucocorticoids
   (GCs) are known for their immunosuppressive effect on DCs, creating
   tolerogenic DCs. GCs activate the type I nuclear receptor (NR)
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR), followed by induced expression of the
   transcription factor glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper (GILZ).
   GILZ has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for GC-induced
   tolerogenic DC generation. Recently, we have identified the DC-specific
   transcript (DC-SCRIPT) as an NR coregulator, suppressing type I steroid
   NRs estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. In this study, we
   analyzed the effect of DC-SCRIPT on GR activity. We demonstrate that
   DC-SCRIPT coexists with GR in protein complexes and functions as a
   corepressor of GR-mediated transcription. Coexpression of DC-SCRIPT and
   GR is shown in human monocyte-derived DCs, and DC-SCRIPT knockdown
   enhances GR-dependent upregulation of GILZ mRNA expression in DCs. This
   demonstrates that DC-SCRIPT serves an important role in regulating GR
   function in DCs, corepressing GR-dependent upregulation of the
   tolerance-inducing transcription factor GILZ. These data imply that by
   controlling GR function and GILZ expression DC-SCRIPT is potentially
   involved in the balance between tolerance and immunity. The Journal of
   Immunology, 2013, 190: 3172-3179.

TI Cloning of TPO gene and associations of polymorphisms with chicken
   growth and carcass traits
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which located on the apical membrane surface
   of thyrocytes, is the key enzyme involved in thyroid hormone synthesis,
   mainly catalyses the iodination of tyrosine residues and the coupling of
   iodotyrosines on thyroglobulin to form thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
   The objectives of this study were to identify genetic polymorphisms of
   the chicken TPO gene and to analyze potential association between single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and growth and carcass traits in
   chicken. Partial sequences of TPO gene were cloned firstly. The
   nucleotide sequence was found to have 72 % identity with that of humans.
   The chicken TPO amino acid sequence was 71 %. Through polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing
   methods, three novel mutations of the chicken TPO gene were detected in
   the F-2 resource population from Gushi chickens and Anka broilers. The
   association analysis indicated that all of the three SNPs showed
   association with chicken growth at different periods. The g.29996C > T
   polymorphisms was significantly associated with body weight, breast bone
   length, pectoral angle at 12 weeks, claw weight and leg muscle weight (P
   < 0.05). In addition, individuals with the TT genotype had higher value
   for almost all the traits than CC and CT genotype. Meanwhile for CLW,
   the additive effects were significant (P < 0.05). Hence, we suggest that
   genotype TT can be regarded as a potential molecular marker for later
   growth and carcass traits in chicken.

TI Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Microarray Analysis Suggest Functional
   Cooperation between Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus ORF57 and
   K-bZIP
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) open reading frame 57
   (ORF57)-encoded protein (Mta) is a multifunctional regulator of viral
   gene expression. ORF57 is essential for viral replication, so
   elucidation of its molecular mechanisms is important for understanding
   KSHV infection. ORF57 has been implicated in nearly every aspect of
   viral gene expression, including transcription, RNA stability, splicing,
   export, and translation. Here we demonstrate that ORF57 interacts with
   the KSHV K-bZIP protein in vitro and in cell extracts from lytically
   reactivated infected cells. To further test the biological relevance of
   the interaction, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation and
   microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis using anti-ORF57 antibodies and a KSHV
   tiling array. The results revealed four specific areas of enrichment,
   including the ORF4 and K8 (K-bZIP) promoters, as well as oriLyt, all of
   which interact with K-bZIP. In addition, ORF57 associated with DNA
   corresponding to the PAN RNA transcribed region, a known
   posttranscriptional target of ORF57. All of the peaks were RNase
   insensitive, demonstrating that ORF57 association with the viral genome
   is unlikely to be mediated exclusively by an RNA tether. Our data
   demonstrate that ORF57 associates with the viral genome by using at
   least two modes of recruitment, and they suggest that ORF57 and K-bZIP
   coregulate viral gene expression during lytic infection.

TI The Mouse Cytosine-5 RNA Methyltransferase NSun2 Is a Component of the
   Chromatoid Body and Required for Testis Differentiation
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB Posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms are crucial for protein
   synthesis during spermatogenesis and are often organized by the
   chromatoid body. Here, we identify the RNA methyltransferase NSun2 as a
   novel component of the chromatoid body and, further, show that NSun2 is
   essential for germ cell differentiation in the mouse testis. In
   NSun2-depleted testes, genes encoding Ddx4, Miwi, and Tudor
   domain-containing (Tdr) proteins are repressed, indicating that
   RNA-processing and posttranscriptional pathways are impaired. Loss of
   NSun2 specifically blocked meiotic progression of germ cells into the
   pachytene stage, as spermatogonial and Sertoli cells were unaffected in
   knockout mice. We observed the same phenotype when we simultaneously
   deleted NSun2 and Dnmt2, the only other cytosine-5 RNA methyltransferase
   characterized to date, indicating that Dnmt2 was not functionally
   redundant with NSun2 in spermatogonial stem cells or Sertoli cells.
   Specific NSun2- and Dnmt2-methylated tRNAs decreased in abundance when
   both methyltransferases were deleted, suggesting that RNA methylation
   pathways play an essential role in male germ cell differentiation.

TI Multiple Functions of Kip-Related Protein5 Connect Endoreduplication and
   Cell Elongation
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Despite considerable progress in our knowledge regarding the cell cycle
   inhibitor of the Kip-related protein (KRP) family in plants, less is
   known about the coordination of endoreduplication and cell
   differentiation. In animals, the role of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
   inhibitors as multifunctional factors coordinating cell cycle regulation
   and cell differentiation is well documented and involves not only the
   inhibition of CDK/cyclin complexes but also other mechanisms, among them
   the regulation of transcription. Interestingly, several plant KRPs have
   a punctuated distribution in the nucleus, suggesting that they are
   associated with heterochromatin. Here, one of these chromatin-bound
   KRPs, KRP5, has been studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). KRP5
   is expressed in endoreduplicating cells, and loss of KRP5 function
   decreases endoreduplication, indicating that KRP5 is a positive
   regulator of endoreduplication. This regulation relies on several
   mechanisms: in addition to its role in cyclin/CDK kinase inhibition
   previously described, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data
   combined with transcript quantification provide evidence that KRP5
   regulates the transcription of genes involved in cell wall organization.
   Furthermore, KRP5 overexpression increases chromocenter decondensation
   and endoreduplication in the Arabidopsis trithorax-related protein5
   (atxr5) atxr6 double mutant, which is deficient for the deposition of
   heterochromatin marks. Hence, KRP5 could bind chromatin to coordinately
   control endoreduplication and chromatin structure and allow the
   expression of genes required for cell elongation.

TI Oxygen, epigenetic signaling, and the evolution of early life
SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB After approximately 3 billion years of unicellular life on Earth,
   multicellular animals appeared some 600 million years ago, followed by
   the rapid emergence of most animal phyla during the Cambrian radiation.
   This evolutionary jump was paralleled by an increase in atmospheric
   oxygen, which I propose allowed the generation of epigenetic signaling
   systems that are essential for cellular differentiation in animals.
   Epigenetic signaling is based on the reversible deposition of chemically
   stable marks in DNA and histone proteins, with methylation of cytosine
   and lysine residues, respectively, playing a central role. Recent
   evidence indicates that the removal of such methyl groups critically
   depends on oxygenases. Hence, reversible epigenetic systems could only
   appear after accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.

TI Mitochondrial DNA Haplotypes Define Gene Expression Patterns in
   Pluripotent and Differentiating Embryonic Stem Cells
SO STEM CELLS
AB Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are associated with various phenotypes,
   such as altered susceptibility to disease, environmental adaptations,
   and aging. Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial DNA is
   essential for cell differentiation and the cell phenotype. However, the
   effects of different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes on differentiation and
   development remain to be determined. Using embryonic stem cell lines
   possessing the same Mus musculus chromosomes but harboring one of Mus
   musculus, Mus spretus, or Mus terricolor mitochondrial DNA haplotypes,
   we have determined the effects of different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes
   on chromosomal gene expression, differentiation, and mitochondrial
   metabolism. In undifferentiated and differentiating embryonic stem
   cells, we observed mitochondrial DNA haplotype-specific expression of
   genes involved in pluripotency, differentiation, mitochondrial energy
   metabolism, and DNA methylation. These mitochondrial DNA haplotypes also
   influenced the potential of embryonic stem cells to produce
   spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. The differences in gene expression
   patterns and cardiomyocyte production were independent of ATP content,
   oxygen consumption, and respiratory capacity, which until now have been
   considered to be the primary roles of mitochondrial DNA. Differentiation
   of embryonic stem cells harboring the different mitochondrial DNA
   haplotypes in a 3D environment significantly increased chromosomal gene
   expression for all haplotypes during differentiation. However,
   haplotype-specific differences in gene expression patterns were
   maintained in this environment. Taken together, these results provide
   significant insight into the phenotypic consequences of mitochondrial
   DNA haplotypes and demonstrate their influence on differentiation and
   development. We propose that mitochondrial DNA haplotypes play a pivotal
   role in the process of differentiation and mediate the fate of the cell.

TI DNA mutagenesis in 2- and 20-yr-old Panax ginseng cell cultures
SO IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT
AB Previously, Panax ginseng var. Mimaki C.A. Meyer had been shown to
   accumulate genetic mutations during long-term propagation of a callus
   culture over a period of 20 yr. In this study, we analyzed the mutation
   types and frequency in a 2-yr-old P. ginseng callus culture and compared
   it with the 20-yr-old callus culture, and leaves of cultivated plants.
   We analyzed the sequence variability between the Actin genes, which are
   a family of housekeeping genes; phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and
   dammarenediol synthase (DDS), which actively participate in the
   biosynthesis of ginsenosides; and the somatic embryogenesis receptor
   kinases (SERK), which control plant development. The frequency of point
   mutations in the Actin, PAL, DDS, and SERK genes in the 2-yr-old P.
   ginseng callus culture was markedly higher than in cultivated plants,
   but lower than in the 20-yr-old callus culture. Most of the mutations in
   the 2-yr-old P. ginseng calli were Aa dagger"G and Ta dagger"C
   transitions, as in the 20-yr-old calli and intact P. ginseng plants. The
   number of nonsynonymous mutations was higher in the 2- and 20-yr-old
   callus cultures than the number of nonsynonymous mutations in cultivated
   P. ginseng. Interestingly, the total number of N -> G or N -> C
   substitutions in the analyzed genes was 1.6 times higher than the total
   number of N -> A or N -> T substitutions. Using a methylation-sensitive
   DNA fragmentation assay, we showed the level of methylcytosine to be
   higher in the DNA of the 20-yr-old P. ginseng calli that than in the DNA
   of the 2-yr-old cultures.

TI Rho-kinase negatively regulates thyroid hormone-stimulated osteocalcin
   synthesis in osteoblasts
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Evidence is accumulating that Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) plays
   important roles not only in vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, but
   also in a variety of cellular functions, including bone metabolism. In
   the present study, we investigated the involvement of Rho-kinase in the
   osteocalcin synthesis induced by triiodothyronine (T-3) in
   osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. T-3 time-dependently induced
   phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT-1), a
   substrate of Rho-kinase. Y27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase,
   attenuated the MYPT-1 phosphorylation induced by T-3. T-3-stimulated
   osteocalcin release was significantly enhanced by Y27632. Fasudil,
   another Rho-kinase inhibitor, amplified the osteocalcin release induced
   by T-3. T-3-stimulated osteocalcin release was significantly augmented
   in Rho-knockdown cells with Rho A-siRNA. Y27632 and fasudil also
   increased the mRNA expression level of osteocalcin induced by T-3. These
   results strongly suggest that T-3 stimulates the activation of
   Rho-kinase in osteoblasts, which functions as a negative regulator of
   T-3-stimulated osteocalcin synthesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

TI Role of epigenetic and miR-22 and miR-29b alterations in the
   downregulation of Mat1a and Mthfr genes in early preneoplastic livers in
   rats induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene
SO MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS
AB Carcinogenesis is a multistep sequential process of clonal expansion of
   initiated cells associated with the accumulation of multiple
   cancer-specific heritable phenotypes. The acquisition of these heritable
   cancer-specific alterations may be triggered by mutational and/or
   non-mutational changes in the genome that affect the regulation of gene
   expression. Currently, cancer-specific epigenetically mediated changes
   in gene expression are regarded as driving events in tumorigenesis. In
   the present study, we investigated the role of gene-specific expression
   changes in the mechanism of rat hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the
   complete hepatocarcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). The results of
   the present study demonstrate significant alterations in gene
   expression, especially of Mat1a and Mthfr genes, during early stages of
   rat 2-AAF-induced liver carcinogenesis. Both of these genes were
   downregulated in the livers of 2-AAF-treated male rats. Inhibition of
   Mat1a expression was associated with an increase in histone H3 lysine 27
   trimethylation and a decrease in histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation at the
   gene promoter/first exon region. Additionally, we demonstrate for the
   first time a critical contribution of miR-22 and miR-29b microRNAs in
   the inhibition of Mat1a and Mthfr gene expression during 2-AAF-induced
   rat hepatocarcinogenesis. The downregulation of Mat1a and Mthfr genes
   was accompanied by marked functional alterations in one-carbon
   metabolism. The results of the present study suggest that downregulation
   of the Mat1a and Mthfr genes may be one of the main driver events that
   promote liver carcinogenesis by causing a profound accumulation of
   subsequent epigenetic abnormalities during progression of the
   carcinogenic process. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Evaluating the Prognostic Factors Associated with Cancer-specific
   Survival of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma Presenting with Distant
   Metastasis
SO ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Because patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) presenting
   with distant metastasis (DM) have a particularly poor prognosis,
   examining the prognostic factors in this group is essential. We aimed to
   evaluate the prognostic factors affecting cancer-specific survival (CSS)
   in DTC patients presenting with DM.
   Of the 1227 DTC patients, 51 (4.2 %) presented with DM at diagnosis. All
   patients underwent a total thyroidectomy, followed by radioiodine (RAI)
   ablation and postablation whole body scan (WBS). Patients were
   considered to have an osseous metastasis if one of the metastatic sites
   involved a bone, while RAI avidity was determined by any visual uptake
   in a known metastatic site on the first WBS. Factors predictive of CSS
   were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses by the Cox
   proportional hazard model.
   In univariate analysis, older age (relative risk [RR] 1.050, 95 %
   confidence interval [CI] 1.010-1.091, P = 0.014), DM discovered before
   WBS (RR 3.401, 95 % CI 1.127-10.309, P = 0.030), follicular thyroid
   carcinoma (RR 3.095, 95 % CI 1.168-8.205, P = 0.025), osseous metastasis
   (RR 4.695, 95 % CI 1.379-15.873, P = 0.013), non-RAI avidity (RR 3.355,
   95 % CI 1.280-8.772, P = 0.014), and external beam radiotherapy to DM
   (RR 3.241, 95 % CI 1.093-9.614, P = 0.034) were significant poor
   prognostic factors for CSS. In the multivariate analysis, after
   adjusting for other factors, osseous metastasis (RR 6.849, 95 % CI
   1.495-31.250, P = 0.013) and non-RAI avidity (RR 7.752, 95 % CI
   2.198-27.027, P = 0.001) were the two independent poor prognostic
   factors for CSS. Older age almost reached statistically significance (RR
   1.055, 95 % CI 0.996-1.117, P = 0.068).
   DTC patients presenting with DM accounted for 4.2 % of all patients.
   Because osseous metastasis and RAI avidity were independent prognostic
   factors, future therapy should be directed at improving the treatment
   efficacy of osseous and/or non-RAI-avid metastases.

TI Tumor Necrosis Factor Induces Sustained Signaling and a Prolonged and
   Unremitting Inflammatory Response in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial
   Fibroblasts
SO ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM
AB Objective The nonresolving character of synovial inflammation in
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a conundrum. To identify the contribution
   of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) to the perpetuation of synovitis,
   we investigated the molecular mechanisms that govern the tumor necrosis
   factor (TNF)driven inflammatory program in human FLS. Methods FLS
   obtained from the synovial tissues of patients with RA or osteoarthritis
   were stimulated with TNF and assayed for gene expression and cytokine
   production by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase
   chain reaction analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NF-B
   signaling was evaluated by Western blotting. Histone acetylation,
   chromatin accessibility, and NF-B p65 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
   occupancy at the interleukin-6 (IL-6) promoter were measured by
   chromatin immunoprecipitation and restriction enzyme accessibility
   assays. Results In FLS, TNF induced prolonged transcription of messenger
   RNA (mRNA) for IL-6 and progressive accumulation of IL-6 protein over 4
   days. Similarly, induction of mRNA for CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES, matrix
   metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), and MMP-3 after TNF stimulation was
   sustained for several days. This contrasted with the macrophage response
   to TNF, which characteristically involved a transient increase in the
   expression of proinflammatory genes. In FLS, TNF induced prolonged
   activation of NF-B signaling and sustained transcriptional activity, as
   indicated by increased histone acetylation, chromatin accessibility, and
   p65 and Pol II occupancy at the IL-6 promoter. Furthermore, FLS
   expressed low levels of the feedback inhibitors A20-binding inhibitor of
   NF-B activation 3 (ABIN-3), IL-1 receptorassociated kinase M (IRAK-M),
   suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), and activating
   transcription factor 3 (ATF-3), which terminate inflammatory responses
   in macrophages. Conclusion TNF signaling is not effectively terminated
   in FLS, which leads to an uncontrolled inflammatory response. The
   results suggest that prolonged and sustained inflammatory responses by
   FLS in response to synovial TNF contribute to the persistence of
   synovial inflammation in RA.

TI Tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 (TSLC1) mediated by dual-regulated
   oncolytic adenovirus exerts specific antitumor actions in a mouse model
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: The tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 (TSLC1) is a candidate tumor
   suppressor of lung cancer, and frequently inactivated in primary
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated the
   effects of TSLC1 mediated by a dual-regulated oncolytic adenovirus on
   lung cancer, and the mechanisms underlying the antitumor actions.
   Methods: The recombinant virus Ad.sp-E1A((Delta 24))-TSLC1 was
   constructed by inserting the TSLC1 gene into the dual-regulated
   Ad.sp-E1A((Delta 24)) vector, which contained the survivin promoter and
   a 24 bp deletion within E1A. The antitumor effects of Ad.sp-E1A((Delta
   24))-TSLC1 were evaluated in NCI-H460, A549, and H1299 lung cancer cell
   lines and the normal fibroblast cell line MRC-5, as well as in A549
   xenograft model in nude mice. Cell viability was assessed using MTT
   assay. The expression of TSLC1 and activation of the caspase signaling
   pathway were detected by Western blot analyses. The tumor tissues from
   the xenograft models were examined using H&E staining, IHC, TUNEL, and
   TEM analyses.
   Results: Infection of A549 lung cancer cells with Ad.sp-E1A((Delta
   24))-TSLC1 induced high level expression of TSLC1. Furthermore, the
   Ad.sp-E1A((Delta 24))-TSLC1 virus dose-dependently suppressed the
   viability of NCI-H460, A549, and H1299 lung cancer cells, and did not
   affect MRC-5 normal fibroblast cells. Infection of NCI-H460, A549, and
   H1299 lung cancer cells with Ad.sp-E1A((Delta 24))-TSLC1 induced
   apoptosis, and increased activation of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP. In
   A549 xenograft model in nude mice, intratumoral injection of
   Ad.sp-E1A((Delta 24))-TSLC1 significantly suppressed the tumor volume,
   and increased the survival rate (from less than 15% to 87.5% at d 60).
   Histological studies showed that injection of Ad.sp-E1A((Delta
   24))-TSLC1 caused tumor cell apoptosis and virus particle propagation in
   tumor tissues.
   Conclusion: The oncolytic adenovirus Ad.sp-E1A((Delta 24))-TSLC1
   exhibits specific antitumor effects, and is a promising agent for the
   treatment of lung cancer.

TI Isolation and structural characterization of a polysaccharide from
   fruits of Zizyphus jujuba cv. Junzao
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB A water-soluble polysaccharide (ZP2a) was obtained by extraction with
   hot water followed by successive chromatographic purification using
   anion exchange and Sepharose CL-6B columns. A symmetrical narrow peak
   was obtained on high-performance gel permeation chromatography with an
   average molecular weight of 120,645 Da, which was named ZP2a. ZP2a is
   composed of rhamnose, arabinose, glucose and galactose in the molar
   ratio 1.3:1.7:0.3:1. Based on gas chromatographic, infrared spectral,
   methylation and NMR analyses, ZP2a was structurally characterized as
   1,4-D-GalpA residues interspersed with 1,2-L-Rhap and 1,2,4-L-Rhap
   residues. The branches were composed of 1,5-L-Araf, 1,3,5-L-Araf,
   1,3-L-Araf, 1,6-D-Galp, 1,4,6-D-Galp and 1,4-D-Glcp. The branches were
   attached to the backbone at the 0-4 position of Rhap residues. (C) 2012

TI One-carbon metabolism factors and leukocyte telomere length
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB Background: Dietary and genetic factors involved in the one-carbon
   metabolism pathway may affect telomere length through DNA methylation
   and synthesis, but this has not been comprehensively investigated in
   epidemiologic studies.
   Objective: We cross-sectionally examined associations between dietary
   and genetic factors in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and relative
   peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length.
   Design: A total of 1715 participants from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS)
   had measurements of relative telomere length and plasma concentrations
   of folate, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, cysteine, and homocysteine.
   Food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) measurements were also used for the
   assessment of folate, choline, methionine, riboflavin, vitamin B-6,
   vitamin B-12, and alcohol intakes. Genotyping was performed on 475
   participants with telomere measurements on 29 mostly nonsynonymous
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in one-carbon
   metabolism. Unconditional logistic and linear regression models were
   used.
   Results: There were no significant dose-response relations between any
   plasma- or FFQ-measured dietary factors and relative telomere length in
   multivariate analyses. For folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12,
   results from the use of FFQ data were consistent with plasma-biomarker
   findings. We showed no significant associations that involved SNPs and
   relative telomere length after we accounted for the false discovery
   rate.
   Conclusion: Our analyses involving plasma and questionnaire measurements
   of one-carbon metabolism factors show that some key dietary and genetic
   factors in this metabolic network are not associated with relative
   peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length. Am J Clin Nutr

TI A common mode of recognition for methylated CpG
SO TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Much is known about vertebrate DNA methylation, however it is not known
   how methylated CpG within particular sequences is recognized. Two recent
   structures of C2H2 zinc finger (ZnF) proteins in complex with methylated
   DNA reveal a common recognition mode for 5-methylcytosine (5mC) that
   involves a 5mC-Arg-G triad. In the two ZnF proteins, an arginine that
   precedes the first Zn-binding histidine (RH motif) can interact with a
   5mCpG or TpG dinucleotide. Among a family of >300 human
   Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain containing ZnF proteins examined,
   two-thirds contained at least one ZnF that included an RH motif. We
   propose that the RH-ZnF motifs provide specificity for 5mCpG, whereas
   the neighboring Zn fingers recognize the surrounding DNA sequence
   context.

TI RNA-Sequencing Quantification of Hepatic Ontogeny and Tissue
   Distribution of mRNAs of Phase II Enzymes in Mice
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB Phase II conjugating enzymes play key roles in the metabolism of
   xenobiotics. In the present study, RNA sequencing was used to elucidate
   hepatic ontogeny and tissue distribution of mRNA expression of all major
   known Phase II enzymes, including enzymes involved in glucuronidation,
   sulfation, glutathione conjugation, acetylation, methylation, and amino
   acid conjugation, as well as enzymes for the synthesis of Phase II
   cosubstrates, in male C57BL/6J mice. Livers from male C57BL/6J mice were
   collected at 12 ages from prenatal to adulthood. Many of these Phase II
   enzymes were expressed at much higher levels in adult livers than in
   perinatal livers, such as Ugt1a6b, -2a3, -2b1, -2b5, -2b36, -3a1, and
   -3a2; Gsta1, -m1, -p1, -p2, and -z1; mGst1; Nat8; Comt; Nnmt; Baat;
   Ugdh; and Gclc. In contrast, hepatic mRNA expression of a few Phase II
   enzymes decreased during postnatal liver development, such as mGst2,
   mGst3, Gclm, and Mat2a. Hepatic expression of certain Phase II enzymes
   peaked during the adolescent stage, such as Ugt1a1, Sult1a1, Sult1c2,
   Sult1d1, Sult2as, Sult5a1, Tpmt, Glyat, Ugp2, and Mat1a. In adult mice,
   the total transcripts for Phase II enzymes were comparable in liver,
   kidney, and small intestine; however, individual Phase II enzymes
   displayed marked tissue specificity among the three organs. In
   conclusion, this study unveils for the first time developmental changes
   in mRNA abundance of all major known Phase II enzymes in mouse liver, as
   well as their tissue-specific expression in key drug-metabolizing
   organs. The age-and tissue-specific expression of Phase II enzymes
   indicate that the detoxification of xenobiotics is highly regulated by
   age and cell type.

TI Benefit-Risk Balance of Reoperation for Persistent Medullary Thyroid
   Cancer
SO ANNALS OF SURGERY
AB Objective: This investigation aimed at exploring the prospects of a cure
   for persistent medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) stratified by basal
   calcitonin levels before reoperation and the number of lymph node
   metastases previously removed at outside facilities.
   Background: There is no evidence-based information supporting the
   balance of surgical benefit and risk in persistent MTC.
   Methods: This retrospective study of 334 patients with persistent MTC
   referred to a tertiary surgical center, who were compared with 367
   patients with previously untreated MTC referred to that institution
   during the same time period, evaluated biochemical cure rates after
   systematic lymph node dissection.
   Results: The relationship between the incremental serum calcitonin level
   before reoperation and the number of lymph node metastases at
   reoperation and biochemical cure was strong after previous removal of 0
   (r = 0.74 and 77%-0%) and 1 to 5 lymph node metastases (r = 0.61 and
   60%-0%) elsewhere. It disappeared once more than 5 lymph node metastases
   had been cleared at other hospitals (nonsignificant and 5%). When serum
   calcitonin levels were 1000 pg/mL or lower before reoperation,
   biochemical cure rates were 44% (59 of 133 patients) and 18% (12 of 65
   patients) after previous removal of 0 and 1 to 5 lymph node metastases,
   respectively. These rates plummeted to 5% (2 of 43 patients) after a
   previous clearance of more than 5 lymph node metastases. When serum
   calcitonin levels exceeded 1000 pg/mL before reoperation, a biochemical
   cure was exceptional (1%; 1 of 76 patients).
   Conclusions: With serum calcitonin levels of 1000 pg/mL or lower before
   reoperation and the previous removal of 5 or fewer lymph node
   metastases, systematic lymph node dissection seems worthwhile for
   persistent MTC. These findings will need to be validated in independent
   series before being adopted more widely as a new standard of care.

TI Functional consequences of mutating conserved SF2 helicase motifs in the
   Type III restriction endonuclease EcoP15I translocase domain
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB For efficient DNA hydrolysis, Type III restriction endonuclease EcoP15I
   interacts with two inversely oriented recognition sites in an
   ATP-dependent process. EcoP15I consists of two methylation (Mod)
   subunits and a single restriction (Res) subunit yielding a
   multifunctional enzyme complex able to methylate or to hydrolyse DNA.
   Comprehensive sequence alignments, limited proteolysis and mass
   spectroscopy suggested that the Res subunit is a fusion of a motor or
   translocase (Tr) domain of superfamily II helicases and an endonuclease
   domain with a catalytic PD...EXK motif. In the Tr domain, seven
   predicted helicase motifs (I, la, II VI), a recently discovered Q-tip
   motif and three additional regions (Ilia, IVa, Va) conserved among Type
   III restriction enzymes have been identified that are predicted to be
   involved in DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Because DNA unwinding
   activity for EcoP15I (as for bona fide helicases) has never been found
   and EcoP15I ATPase rates are only low, the functional importance of the
   helicase motifs and regions was questionable and has never been probed
   systematically. Therefore, we mutated all helicase motifs and conserved
   regions predicted in Type III restriction enzyme EcoP15I and examined
   the functional consequences on EcoP15I enzyme activity and the
   structural integrity of the variants by CD spectroscopy. The resulting
   eleven enzyme variants all, except variant IVa, are properly folded
   showing the same secondary structure distribution as the wild-type
   enzyme. Classical helicase motifs I VI are important for ATP and DNA
   cleavage by EcoP15I and mutations therein led to complete loss of ATPase
   and cleavage activity. Among the catalytically inactive enzyme variants
   three preserved the ability to bind ATP. In contrast, newly assigned
   motifs Q-tip, Ia and Va are not essential for EcoP15I activity and the
   corresponding enzyme variants were still catalytically active. DNA
   binding was only marginally reduced (2-7 fold) in all enzyme variants
   tested. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Folate, alcohol, and liver disease
SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is typically associated with folate
   deficiency, which is the result of reduced dietary folate intake,
   intestinal malabsorption, reduced liver uptake and storage, and
   increased urinary folate excretion. Folate deficiency favors the
   progression of liver disease through mechanisms that include its effects
   on methionine metabolism with consequences for DNA synthesis and
   stability and the epigenetic regulation of gene expression involved in
   pathways of liver injury. This paper reviews the pathogenesis of ALD
   with particular focus on ethanol-induced alterations in methionine
   metabolism, which may act in synergy with folate deficiency to decrease
   antioxidant defense as well as DNA stability while regulating epigenetic
   mechanisms of relevant gene expressions. We also review the current
   evidence available on potential treatments of ALD based on correcting
   abnormalities in methionine metabolism and the methylation regulation of
   relevant gene expressions.

TI Precursor lesions of endocrine system neoplasms
SO PATHOLOGY
AB The concept of precursor lesions of endocrine neoplasms is a new and
   interesting topic in endocrine pathology. A variety of
   clinicopathological conditions are associated with a sequence of
   cellular changes from hyperplasia to neoplasia; dysplasia is, in
   contrast, quite rare. The majority of precursor lesions is associated
   with familial genetic syndromes. These include C-cell hyperplasia in
   thyroid that is associated with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma,
   adrenal medullary hyperplasia as a precursor of phaeochromocytomas in
   MEN2 syndrome, rare pituitary adenohypophyseal cell hyperplasia in
   familial syndromes associated with pituitary adenomas, MEN1-related
   precursor gastric enterochromaffin-like cell (ECL) hyperplasia, and
   duodenal gastrin producing (G) and/or somatostatin producing (D) cell
   hyperplasia that give rise to type II gastric neuroendocrine tumours
   (NETs) and duodenal NETs, respectively, and MEN1- or VHL-related islet
   hyperplasia, islet dysplasia and ductulo-insular complexes that are
   associated with pancreatic NETs. Other hyperplasias are not thought to
   be associated with genetic predisposition. Some are attributed to
   inflammation; autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis-related ECL
   hyperplasia can progress to type I gastric NETs, and EC
   (enterochromaffin) cell or L cell hyperplasia associated with
   inflammatory bowel diseases can progress to colorectal NETs. In the
   lung, diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia can
   give rise to peripherally-located low grade pulmonary NETs and
   tumourlets (neuroendocrine microtumours <5 mm). Rarely, secondary
   hyperplasias develop into autonomous neoplasms, as in tertiary
   hyperparathyroidism or pituitary thyrotroph adenomas in primary
   hypothyroidism. While some precursor lesions, such as thyroid C cell
   hyperplasia, represent frankly premalignant conditions, others may
   represent a sequence of proliferative changes from hyperplasia to benign
   neoplasia that may also progress to malignancy.

TI Physiological states and functional relation between thyrotropin and
   free thyroxine in thyroid health and disease: in vivo and in silico data
   suggest a hierarchical model
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
AB Aims Understanding the exact relationship between serum
   thyrotropin/thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4)
   is a prerequisite for improving diagnostic reliability and clinical
   decision making.
   Methods We (1) retrospectively studied the relationship between TSH and
   FT4 in a large unselected clinical sample (n=6641) of primary
   hypothyroid, euthyroid and hyperthyroid subjects, and (2) applied a
   mathematical model of thyroid hormone feedback control to assess the
   relation between structural parameters and TSH levels in the different
   functional states.
   Results When separately analysing total sample and untreated subjects,
   the correlation slope for logTSH versus FT4 for hypothyroid subjects was
   significantly different from that of the euthyroid panel and
   hyperthyroid subjects (the latter being compromised by reaching the TSH
   assay's lower detection limit). As trends between functional states
   changed, each functional segment appeared to become differently
   regulated. Theoretical modelling and sensitivity analysis revealed that
   the influence of various structural parameters on TSH levels also
   depends on the overall function of the feedback loop.
   Conclusions Our data suggest that the states of hypothyroidism,
   euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be regarded as differently
   regulated entities. The apparent complexity could be replicated by
   mathematical modelling suggesting a hierarchical type of feedback
   regulation involving patterns of operative mechanisms unique to each
   condition. For clinical purposes and assay evaluation, neither the
   standard model relating logTSH with FT4, nor an alternative model based
   on non-competitive inhibition can be reliably represented by a single
   correlation comparing all samples for both hormones in one all-inclusive
   group.

TI Assessment of Different Functional Parameters of FrozenThawed Buffalo
   Spermatozoa by Using Cytofluorimetric Determinations
SO REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB Flow cytometry is a useful tool that provides an accurate, objective and
   rapid evaluation of semen quality. The use of this technique could
   significantly improve the quality of buffalo semen samples used in
   artificial insemination. This study was carried out to evaluate, by flow
   cytometry, frozenthawed buffalo spermatozoa quality parameters such as
   sperm viability by SYBR-14/propidium iodide staining; mitochondrial
   function by JC-1 potentiometric probe; sperm chromatin stability (SCSA)
   by acridine orange; and acrosome reaction (AR) by FITC-PNA staining.
   Semen samples from five Italian Mediterranean buffalo bulls were used.
   Sperm viability was not different between bulls and ranged from 33.4% to
   43.6%. A consistent rate (55.1 +/- 10.8%) of sperm cells showed high
   mitochondrial membrane potential (high), with no significant differences
   between subjects. Sperm chromatin structure assay differed significantly
   between the five buffalo bulls; moreover, data showed high stability
   within each buffalo. DNA fragmentation indexes (DFI), such as %-DFI,
   -DFI, SD-DFI, were 11.2 +/- 8.6, 153.3 +/- 24.6 and 81.6 +/- 21.2,
   respectively. Regarding AR, the percentage of acrosome-reacted live
   (ARL) and acrosome-reacted dead (ARD) spermatozoa was 0.3 +/- 0.2 and
   15.3 +/- 5.5, respectively. This functional parameter differed
   significantly between buffalo bulls and showed high stability. Following
   to Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for 3h, AR significantly differed between
   subjects and was characterized by an increase in both ARL (10.8%) and
   ARD population (22.0%). This study indicates that flow cytometry could
   be a useful tool for a quick multiparametric evaluation of sperm quality
   in buffalo. In particular, SCSA and AR resulted in sperm functional
   parameters sensitive enough for the diagnosis of frozen-thawed semen
   fertilizing potential.

   reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells is enhanced when vitamin C is
   present, thereby illustrating previous limitations in reprogramming
   cultures. Here, we summarize understanding of dioxygenase function in

TI Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative
   science to analyze environment, host, and disease
SO MODERN PATHOLOGY
AB Epigenetics acts as an interface between environmental/exogenous
   factors, cellular responses, and pathological processes. Aberrant
   epigenetic signatures are a hallmark of complex multifactorial diseases
   (including neoplasms and malignancies such as leukemias, lymphomas,
   sarcomas, and breast, lung, prostate, liver, and colorectal cancers).
   Epigenetic signatures (DNA methylation, mRNA and microRNA expression,
   etc) may serve as biomarkers for risk stratification, early detection,
   and disease classification, as well as targets for therapy and
   chemoprevention. In particular, DNA methylation assays are widely
   applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue specimens
   as clinical pathology tests. To better understand the interplay between
   etiological factors, cellular molecular characteristics, and disease
   evolution, the field of 'molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE)' has
   emerged as an interdisciplinary integration of 'molecular pathology' and
   'epidemiology'. In contrast to traditional epidemiological research
   including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MPE is founded on the
   unique disease principle, that is, each disease process results from
   unique profiles of exposomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes,
   metabolomes, microbiomes, and interactomes in relation to the
   macroenvironment and tissue microenvironment. MPE may represent a
   logical evolution of GWAS, termed 'GWAS-MPE approach'. Although
   epigenome-wide association study attracts increasing attention,
   currently, it has a fundamental problem in that each cell within one
   individual has a unique, time-varying epigenome. Having a similar
   conceptual framework to systems biology, the holistic MPE approach
   enables us to link potential etiological factors to specific molecular
   pathology, and gain novel pathogenic insights on causality. The
   widespread application of epigenome (eg, methylome) analyses will
   enhance our understanding of disease heterogeneity, epigenotypes (CpG
   island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 (long interspersed nucleotide
   element-1; also called long interspersed nuclear element-1; long
   interspersed element-1; L1) hypomethylation, etc), and host-disease
   interactions. In this article, we illustrate increasing contribution of
   modern pathology to broader public health sciences, which attests
   pivotal roles of pathologists in the new integrated MPE science towards
   our ultimate goal of personalized medicine and prevention. Modern

TI The other gastropod larvae: Larval morphogenesis in a marine neritimorph
SO JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY
AB Two of the three major gastropod clades with feeding larvae are sister
   groups and larval morphogenesis for members of these clades, the
   Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia, has been well studied. The third
   clade, the Neritimorpha, has an unstable phylogenetic position and
   little is known about development of their planktotrophic larvae.
   Information about larval morphology of neritimorphs and resolution of
   their controversial phylogenetic placement is critically important for
   understanding evolution of larval feeding within the Gastropoda. We
   describe larval morphogenesis to metamorphic competence for
   laboratory-reared larvae of Nerita melanotragus (Smith, 1884)
   (Neritimorpha: Neritidae). Preliminary observations suggest that
   prehatch larvae are capable of delayed hatching, possibly by entering a
   diapause state. Our description of larval morphogenesis, as based on
   tissue sections for light and transmission electron microscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, three-dimensional-reconstructions of sectioned
   tissue, and labeling of muscles with fluorphore-tagged phalloidin,
   revealed four features that are unprecedented among both feeding and
   nonfeeding gastropod larvae. Larvae of N. melanotragus have muscles on
   the left and right side that both meet current criteria of a larval
   retractor muscle; shell-anchored muscles with oblique striations that
   project inside the visceral nerve loop to insert mainly on the velar
   lobes. They also have left and right digestive glands of similar size
   and a left and right hypobranchial gland. A larval heart is absent, but
   water circulation through the mantle cavity may be facilitated by large
   circular orifices, lined by patches of motile cilia, leading in and out
   of the mantle cavity. Comparison of larval traits among all three groups
   of gastropods with feeding larvae indicates that larvae of N.
   melanotragus have many unique characteristics, but they show more
   similarities to caenogastropod than to heterobranch larvae. These
   results are a significant step toward the goal of identifying primitive
   versus derived larval traits among feeding gastropod larvae. (c) J.

TI A Novel Technique for the Resection of the Symptomatic Lingual Thyroid:
   Transoral Robotic Surgery
SO THYROID
AB Background: Treatment of the symptomatic lingual thyroid is typically
   accomplished through surgical resection using a transcervical approach,
   which carries a high risk of treatment-related morbidity and leaves a
   visible scar on the neck. In order to reduce morbidity and eliminate
   visible scarring, this study utilized transoral robotic surgery (TORS)
   in performing lingual thyroidectomy.
   Methods: Between October 2009 and October 2010, three patients with
   symptomatic lingual thyroid were enrolled in this prospective study.
   Primary symptoms included dysphagia (two patients) and hemorrhage (one
   patient). A da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.,
   Sunnyvale, CA) was used to perform TORS in all patients. A face-up 30
   degrees endoscope was inserted through the oral cavity, and two
   instruments were positioned on either side of the endoscope. We
   evaluated the robotic set-up time, operating time, volume of blood loss,
   surgery-related complications, postoperative symptomatic improvement,
   and cosmetic results.
   Results: The transoral robotic lingual thyroidectomy was successfully
   performed in all patients. The mean operating time was 43 minutes (range
   35-50 minutes), and an average of 11 minutes (range 10-15 minutes) was
   required to set up the robotic system. All patients were satisfied with
   their cosmetic results and the improvement of their symptoms after the
   operation. There were no perioperative complications or significant
   bleeding. The average volume of blood loss during the operation was
   25mL.
   Conclusions: The use of TORS for lingual thyroidectomy was both
   technically feasible and safe, suggesting that it may be considered a
   viable alternative to other invasive surgical approaches in patients
   with symptomatic lingual thyroid.

TI Oxygen Consumption and Usage During Physical Exercise: The Balance
   Between Oxidative Stress and ROS-Dependent Adaptive Signaling
SO ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING
AB The complexity of human DNA has been affected by aerobic metabolism,
   including endurance exercise and oxygen toxicity. Aerobic endurance
   exercise could play an important role in the evolution of Homo sapiens,
   and oxygen was not important just for survival, but it was crucial to
   redox-mediated adaptation. The metabolic challenge during physical
   exercise results in an elevated generation of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) that are important modulators of muscle contraction, antioxidant
   protection, and oxidative damage repair, which at moderate levels
   generate physiological responses. Several factors of mitochondrial
   biogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c
   coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and
   SIRT1, are modulated by exercise-associated changes in the redox milieu.
   PGC-1 alpha activation could result in decreased oxidative challenge,
   either by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and/or by an increased
   number of mitochondria that allows lower levels of respiratory activity
   for the same degree of ATP generation. Endogenous thiol antioxidants
   glutathione and thioredoxin are modulated with high oxygen consumption
   and ROS generation during physical exercise, controlling cellular
   function through redox-sensitive signaling and protein-protein
   interactions. Endurance exercise-related angiogenesis, up to a
   significant degree, is regulated by ROS-mediated activation of
   hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. Moreover, the exercise-associated ROS
   production could be important to DNA methylation and post-translation
   modifications of histone residues, which create heritable adaptive
   conditions based on epigenetic features of chromosomes. Accumulating
   data indicate that exercise with moderate intensity has systemic and
   complex health-promoting effects, which undoubtedly involve regulation
   of redox homeostasis and signaling. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 18,

TI Inhibition of 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenase by Helicobacter
   pylori in Human Gastric Carcinogenesis
SO CANCER PREVENTION RESEARCH
AB Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection induces a chronic inflammatory
   response, which promotes gastric carcinogenesis. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin
   dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) plays a key role as a tumor suppressor in
   gastrointestinal cancers. The aim of this study was to elucidate the
   role of 15-PGDH in gastric carcinogenesis associated with H. pylori.
   15-PGDH expression in gastric biopsies from H. pylori-infected (n = 25)
   and noninfected (n = 15) subjects was analyzed by quantitative real-time
   PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. 15-PGDH DNA
   methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR and
   pyrosequencing. The expression of 15-PGDH, Snail, extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, TLR4, and MyD88 in response to H.
   pylori infection was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Compared with
   negative specimens, H. pylori-positive specimens had 2-fold lower
   15-PGDH mRNA levels and significantly less 15-PGDH protein. In four H.
   pylori-infected subjects with longitudinal follow-up, the suppression of
   15-PGDH expression was reversed by H. pylori eradication therapy. In
   parallel with suppressing 15-PGDH expression, H. pylori infection
   activated expression of TLR4 and MyD88 expression, increased levels of
   phospho-ERK1/2, and increased expression of EGF receptor (EGFR)-Snail.
   Inhibition of Snail and MyD88 reversed suppression of 15-PGDH
   expression, and siMyD88 reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2. Similarly,
   treatment with an ERK1/2 and EGFR inhibitor also restored 15-PGDH
   expression. H. pylori appeared to promote gastric carcinogenesis by
   suppressing 15-PGDH. This process is mediated by the TLR4/MyD88 pathway
   via ERK1/2 or EGFR-Snail transcriptional regulation. 15-PGDH may be a
   useful marker and a potential therapeutic target in H. pylori-induced
   gastric carcinogenesis. Cancer Prev Res; 6(4); 349-59. (c) 2013 AACR.

TI A test of Suchey-Brooks (pubic symphysis) and Buckberry-Chamberlain
   (auricular surface) methods on an identified Spanish sample:
   paleodemographic implications
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB Forensic Anthropology and Bioarchaeology studies depend critically on
   the accuracy and reliability of age-estimation techniques. In this study
   we have evaluated two age-estimation methods for adults based on the
   pubic symphysis (Suchey-Brooks) and the auricular surface
   (Buckberry-Chamberlain) in a current sample of 139 individuals (67 women
   and 72 men) from Madrid in order to verify the accuracy of both methods
   applied to a sample of innominate bones from the central Iberian
   Peninsula. Based on the overall results of this study, the
   Buckberry-Chamberlain method seems to be the method that provides better
   estimates in terms of accuracy (percentage of hits) and absolute
   difference to the chronological age taking into account the total
   sample. The percentage of hits and mean absolute difference of the
   Buckberry-Chamberlain and Suchey-Brooks methods are 97.3% and 11.24
   years, and 85.7% and 14.38 years, respectively. However, this apparently
   greater applicability of the Buckberry-Chamberlain method is mainly due
   to the broad age ranges provided. Results indicated that Suchey-Brooks
   method is more appropriate for populations with a majority of young
   individuals, whereas Buckberry-Chamberlain method is recommended for
   populations with a higher percentage of individuals in the range 60-70
   years. These different age estimation methodologies significantly
   influence the resulting demographic profile, consequently affecting the
   biological characteristics reconstruction of the samples in which they
   are applied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Allopolyploidy has a moderate impact on restructuring at three
   contrasting transposable element insertion sites in resynthesized
   Brassica napus allotetraploids
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB The role played by whole-genome duplication (WGD) in evolution and
   adaptation is particularly well illustrated in allopolyploids, where WGD
   is concomitant with interspecific hybridization. This Genome Shock',
   usually accompanied by structural and functional modifications, has been
   associated with the activation of transposable elements (TEs). However,
   the impact of allopolyploidy on TEs has been studied in only a few
   polyploid species, and not in Brassica, which has been marked by
   recurrent polyploidy events. Here, we developed sequence-specific
   amplification polymorphism (SSAP) markers for three contrasting TEs, and
   compared profiles between resynthesized Brassica napus allotetraploids
   and their diploid Brassica progenitors. To evaluate restructuring at TE
   insertion sites, we scored changes in SSAP profiles and analysed a large
   set of differentially amplified SSAP bands. No massive structural
   changes associated with the three TEs surveyed were detected. However,
   several transposition events, specific to the youngest TE originating
   from the B.oleracea genome, were identified. Our study supports the
   hypothesis that TE responses to allopolyploidy are highly specific. The
   changes observed in SSAP profiles lead us to hypothesize that they may
   partly result from changes in DNA methylation, questioning the role of
   epigenetics during the formation of a new allopolyploid genome.

TI Regulation of gonadal sex ratios and pubertal development by the thyroid
   endocrine system in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB We examined associations between thyroid condition, gonadal sex and
   pubertal development in zebrafish. Seventy-two-hour postfertilization
   larvae were reared in untreated medium or in the presence of goitrogens
   (sodium perchlorate, 0.82 mM; methimazole, 0.15 and 0.3 mM) or thyroxine
   (1 and 10 nM) for 30 days. Thyrocyte height, gonadal sex and gonadal
   development were histologically determined at 45 and 60 days
   postfertilization (dpf). Thyrocyte hypertrophy, an index of
   hypothyroidism, was observed at 45 and 60 dpf in perchlorate-treated but
   only at 45 dpf in methimazole-treated fish. Similarly, gonadal sex
   ratios were biased toward ovaries relative to control animals at 45 and
   60 dpf in perchlorate-treated fish but only at 45 dpf in
   methimazole-treated fish. Gonadal sex ratios were biased toward testes
   at 45 and 60 dpf in thyroxine-treated fish. Spermatogenesis was delayed
   in testes from goitrogen-treated fish at 60 dpf relative to control
   values, but was unaffected in testes from thyroxine-treated individuals.
   Oogenesis seemed to be nonspecifically delayed in all treatments
   relative to control at 60 dpf. This study confirmed the previously
   reported association between hypothyroid condition and ovarian-skewed
   ratios, and hyperthyroid condition and testicular-skewed ratios, and
   also showed that male pubertal development is specifically delayed by
   experimental hypothyroidism. The simultaneous recovery from the
   hypothyroid and ovary-inducing effects of methimazole by 60 dpf (27 days
   post-treatment) suggests that the ovary-skewing effect of goitrogens is
   reversible when thyroid conditions return to basal levels before
   developmental commitment of gonadal sex. Conversely, the masculinizing
   effect of hyperthyroidism seems to be stable and perhaps permanent.

TI Daily Acclimation Handling Does Not Affect Hippocampal Long-Term
   Potentiation or Cause Chronic Sleep Deprivation in Mice
SO SLEEP
AB Study Objectives: Gentle handling is commonly used to perform brief
   sleep deprivation in rodents. It was recently reported that daily
   acclimation handling, which is often used before behavioral assays,
   causes alterations in sleep, stress, and levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor subunits prior to the actual period of sleep deprivation. It
   was therefore suggested that acclimation handling could mediate some of
   the observed effects of subsequent sleep deprivation. Here, we examine
   whether acclimation handling, performed as in our sleep deprivation
   studies, alters sleep/wake behavior, stress, or forms of hippocampal
   synaptic plasticity that are impaired by sleep deprivation.
   Design: Adult C57BL/6J mice were either handled daily for 6 days or were
   left undisturbed in their home cages. On the day after the 6th day of
   handling, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in hippocampal slices
   with spaced four-train stimulation, which we previously demonstrated to
   be impaired by brief sleep deprivation. Basal synaptic properties were
   also assessed. In three other sets of animals, activity monitoring,
   polysomnography, and stress hormone measurements were performed during
   the 6 days of handling.
   Results: Daily gentle handling alone does not alter LTP, rest/activity
   patterns, or sleep/wake architecture. Handling initially induces a
   minimal stress response, but by the 6th day, stress hormone levels are
   unaltered by handling.
   Conclusion: It is possible to handle mice daily to accustom them to the
   researcher without causing alterations in sleep, stress, or synaptic
   plasticity in the hippocampus. Therefore, effects of acclimation
   handling cannot explain the impairments in signaling mechanisms,
   synaptic plasticity, and memory that result from brief sleep
   deprivation.

TI Influence of Drought on Salamander Occupancy of Isolated Wetlands on the
   Southeastern Coastal Plain of the United States
SO WETLANDS
AB In the southeastern U.S., changes in temperature and precipitation over
   the last three decades have been the most dramatic in winter and spring
   seasons. Continuation of these trends could negatively impact
   pond-breeding amphibians, especially those that rely on winter and
   spring rains to fill seasonal wetlands, trigger breeding, and ensure
   reproductive success. From 2009 to 2012, we monitored Spring and Fall
   presence of aquatic stages (larval and paedomorphic, gilled adult) of a
   winter-breeding amphibian (the mole salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum)
   and used multi-season models to estimate occupancy, local colonization
   and extinction. Seasonal estimates of occupancy, corrected for imperfect
   detection, declined from 22.3 % of ponds in Spring 2009 to 9.9 % in Fall
   2012. Our best supported model suggested that changes in occupancy were
   driven by increased rates of extinction that corresponded with
   drought-related drying of ponds. Based on uncertainty in climate change
   projections for the Southeast, we present a conceptual model of
   predicted changes in wetland hydroperiods across a landscape with
   projected decreases and increases in future precipitation. Such
   precipitation changes could alter wetland hydroperiods, facilitate
   extinctions of species adapted to short, intermediate or long
   hydroperiod environments and, ultimately, modify the composition of
   amphibian communities within freshwater wetland ecosystems.

TI Recruitment of Brd4 to the Human Papillomavirus Type 16 DNA Replication
   Complex Is Essential for Replication of Viral DNA
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Replication of the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genome relies on viral
   factors E1 and E2 and the cellular replication machinery.
   Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) interacts with viral E2 protein
   to mediate papillomavirus (PV) genome maintenance and viral
   transcription. However, the functional role of Brd4 in the HPV life
   cycle remains to be clearly defined. In this study, we provide the first
   look into the E2-Brd4 interaction in the presence of other important
   viral factors, such as the HPV16 E1 protein and the viral genome. We
   show that Brd4 is recruited to actively replicating HPV16 origin foci
   together with HPV16 E1, E2, and a number of the cellular replication
   factors: replication protein A70 (RPA70), replication factor C1 (RFC1),
   and DNA polymerase delta. Mutagenesis disrupting the E2-Brd4 interaction
   abolishes the formation of the HPV16 replication complex and impairs
   HPV16 DNA replication in cells. Brd4 was further demonstrated to be
   necessary for HPV16 viral DNA replication using a cell-free replication
   system in which depletion of Brd4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
   silencing leads to impaired HPV16 viral DNA replication and recombinant
   Brd4 protein is able to rescue viral DNA replication. In addition,
   releasing endogenous Brd4 from cellular chromatin by using the
   bromodomain inhibitor JQ1(+) enhances HPV16 DNA replication,
   demonstrating that the role of Brd4 in HPV DNA replication could be
   uncoupled from its function in chromatin-associated transcriptional
   regulation and cell cycle control. Our study reveals a new role for Brd4
   in HPV genome replication, providing novel insights into understanding
   the life cycle of this oncogenic DNA virus.

TI Near-future ocean acidification causes differences in microbial
   associations within diverse coral reef taxa
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Microorganisms form symbiotic partnerships with a diverse range of
   marine organisms and can be critical to the health and survival of their
   hosts. Despite the importance of these relationships, the sensitivity of
   symbiotic microbes to ocean acidification (OA) is largely unknown and
   this needs to be redressed to adequately predict marine ecosystem
   resilience in a changing climate. We adopted a profiling approach to
   explore the sensitivity of microbes associated with coral reef biofilms
   and representatives of three ecologically important calcifying
   invertebrate phyla [corals, foraminifera and crustose coralline algae
   (CCA)] to OA. The experimental design for this study comprised four pHs
   consistent with current IPCC predictions for the next few centuries
   (pHNIST 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5); these pH/pCO2 conditions were produced in
   flow-through aquaria using CO2 bubbling. All reduced pH/increased pCO2
   treatments caused clear differences in the microbial communities
   associated with coral, foraminifera, CCA and reef biofilms over 6 weeks,
   while no visible signs of host stress were detected over this period.
   The microbial communities of coral, foraminifera, CCA and biofilms were
   significantly different between pH8.1 (pCO2=464atm) and pH7.9
   (pCO2=822atm), a concentration likely to be exceeded by the end of the
   present century. This trend continued at lower pHs/higher pCO2. 16S rRNA
   gene sequencing revealed variable and species-specific changes in the
   microbial communities with no microbial taxa consistently present or
   absent from specific pH treatments. The high sensitivity of coral,
   foraminifera, CCA and biofilm microbes to OA conditions projected to
   occur by 2100 is a concern for reef ecosystems and highlights the need
   for urgent research to assess the implications of microbial shifts for
   host health and coral reef processes.

TI Rapid Onsite Evaluation Improves the Adequacy of Fine-Needle Aspiration
   for Thyroid Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO THYROID
AB Background: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasonography guidance
   is one of the optimal techniques for the diagnostic evaluation of
   thyroid nodules. A significant subset of thyroid FNAs continues to be
   inadequate for interpretation, which potentially leads to increased
   costs from repeat aspirations. Numerous studies have been published
   regarding the influence of rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) by
   cytopathologists on thyroid FNAs, some indicating that FNA is more
   likely to be adequate for interpretation with ROSE, while others refute
   this idea. To our knowledge, no meta-analysis of the literature on this
   subject has been undertaken.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE using the following search
   string: (needle biopsy) AND (assessment or onsite OR onsite or immediate
   or rapid)/title or abstract. There were no restrictions on study design,
   language, anatomic site, or time period. Only studies comparing two arms
   (with/without ROSE) at a single site were eligible for inclusion.
   Potentially relevant studies were subjected to a citation search
   (forward search) and reference search (backward search) using SCOPUS.
   Statistical calculations were performed using Stata Release 12.
   Meta-analysis was completed using a random-effect model as implemented
   in the metan routine in Stata.
   Results: An initial search obtained 2179 studies from MEDLINE and
   EMBASE, and screening yielded 71 potentially relevant studies. A focused
   review of this subset resulted in seven full studies and one abstract
   that met our inclusion criteria. Our citation search using SCOPUS
   yielded no new studies. Overall, the average adequacy rate was 83%
   without ROSE compared to 92% with ROSE. Visual inspection of the data
   suggested that the improvement in adequacy due to ROSE may be related to
   the adequacy rate without ROSE. Metaregression analysis showed that the
   change in the adequacy rate was strongly correlated (t = -12.7, p <
   0.001) with the non-ROSE adequacy rate. In addition, the non-ROSE
   adequacy rate explained all, but 10% of the residual between study
   variability in the change in the adequacy rates due to ROSE.
   Conclusions: ROSE is generally associated with an improvement in
   adequacy, but the impact of ROSE depends heavily on the initial adequacy

TI A Carcinoma Showing Thymus-Like Elements of the Thyroid Arising in Close
   Association with Solid Cell Nests: Evidence for a Precursor Lesion?
SO THYROID
AB Background: Carcinoma showing thymus-like elements (CASTLE) is a rare
   malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland, morphologically and
   immunohistologically similar to a thymic carcinoma, whose histogenesis
   is still debated. Hypotheses include an origin from ectopic thymic
   tissue, vestige of the thymopharyngeal duct, or branchial pouch remnants
   from which solid cell nests (SC-nests) originate. The diagnosis of
   CASTLE may be treacherous due to its rarity and its propensity to mimic
   other poorly differentiated tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma.
   Methods: We present a case of CASTLE in a 58-year-old man initially
   diagnosed as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma both on
   fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and on biopsy, arising in close
   association with SC-nests. A thorough literature review, with special
   emphasis on its diagnosis and histogenesis of CASTLE, was also
   conducted.
   Results: Magnetic resonance images revealed a 4.0-cm cervical mass on
   the left side of the trachea, involving the lateral middle/inferior
   portion of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. FNAC was performed with a
   diagnosis of "malignant cells, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma."
   A histological evaluation of the resected specimen revealed a malignant
   proliferation of cells, focally exhibiting a squamoid appearance, which
   were immunopositive for CD5 and p63. A diagnosis of CASTLE was made. The
   tumor was located in direct continuity with SC-Nests, and the cell
   morphology of both the SC-nests and CASTLE was very similar with
   merging. Moreover, the immunohistochemical expression profiles of most
   markers useful in the diagnosis of CASTLE were identical in the
   SC-nests.
   Conclusions: The inclusion of CASTLE in the differential diagnosis of
   poorly differentiated tumors of the thyroid region and the use of
   ancillary studies are essential to diagnose this rare entity associated
   with a relatively favorable prognosis. The close association of CASTLE
   with SC-nests opens the way to a new scenario for studies of its
   histogenesis.

TI Successive transformation of benzo[a]pyrene by laccase of Trametes
   versicolor and pyrene-degrading Mycobacterium strains
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB We previously hypothesized that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
   (PAH)-degrading bacteria that produce laccase may enhance the degree of
   benzo[a]pyrene mineralization. However, whether the metabolites of
   benzo[a]pyrene oxidized by laccase can be further transformed by PAH
   degraders remains unknown. In this study, pyrene-degrading mycobacteria
   with diverse degradation properties were isolated and employed for
   investigating the subsequent transformation on the metabolites of
   benzo[a]pyrene oxidized by fungal laccase of Trametes versicolor. The
   results confirm the successive transformation of benzo[a]pyrene
   metabolites, 6-benzo[a]pyrenyl acetate, and quinones by Mycobacterium
   strains, and report the discovery of the involvement of a O-methylation
   mediated pathway in the process. In detail, the vast majority of
   metabolite 6-benzo[a]pyrenyl acetate was transformed into benzo[a]pyrene
   quinones or methoxybenzo[a]pyrene, via two distinct steps that were
   controlled by the catechol-O-methyltransferase mediated O-methylation,
   while quinones were reduced to dihydroxybenzo[a]pyrene and further
   transformed into dimethoxy derivatives.

TI Down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 3B in staurosporine-induced
   apoptosis and its mechanism in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Abnormal DNA methylation is one of the important characteristics in
   tumor cells. Apoptosis plays an essential role in cell survival and
   processing. It is not clear whether DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)
   change in apoptosis and how DNMTs are regulated in apoptosis. In this
   study, we found that SMMC-7721 or BEL-7404 cells were induced to
   apoptosis by STS, meanwhile the DNMT3B protein and mRNA level were
   decreased. To explore the mechanism of DNMT3B down-regulation, we found
   that the mRNA decay was not changed and core promoter activity of DNMT3B
   gene was decreased in STS-induced apoptosis. In order to figure out the
   signal molecule involved in transcriptional regulation of DNMT3B gene by
   STS, p-JNK, p-ERK, and p-p38 were examined. In STS-induced apoptosis
   p-JNK level was increased, and p-ERK and p-p38 were decreased.
   Furthermore, the inhibitor of p-JNK significantly alleviated the decline
   of DNMT3B protein. We also found that the siRNA of DNMT3B strengthened
   the cleavage of PARP and pro-caspase-3 as well as up-regulated the p16
   gene expression in STS-treated cells. We concluded here that
   STS-regulated DNMT3B gene expression via p-JNK and down-regulation of
   DNMT3B-mediated STS-induced apoptosis through the up-regulation p16
   expression.

TI Concentration of fecal cortisol metabolites in chamois in relation to
   tourist pressure in Tatra National Park (South Poland)
SO ACTA THERIOLOGICA
AB In protected areas, outdoor recreation, and nature-based tourism can act
   as potential stressors for wildlife. Given the growing demand for nature
   recreation, the consequences of high tourist visitation on wildlife need
   to be assessed in order to avoid incompatibilities between public use
   and species protection goals. The Tatra National Park (Poland), in the
   Carpathian Mountains, is a unique alpine ecosystem visited by three
   million tourists per year. It hosts the only native population of an
   endemic subspecies of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica). We
   investigated the effects of tourist disturbance, the number of visitors,
   and the season on the concentration of fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM)
   in Tatra chamois in 2009. FCM levels of chamois were significantly
   higher and showed higher variation at high tourist disturbance (mean +/-
   SD, 46.2 +/- 31.53 ng/g, n = 56) than at low disturbance sites (mean +/-
   SD, 17.2 +/- 8.05 ng/g, n = 38). Stress levels increased with the number
   of visitors and therefore showed a peak in summer, coinciding with the
   highest number of visitation to the national park. A large portion of
   chamois habitat in Tatra National Park is within the area of influence
   of the touristic trail network. The temporal or permanent creation of
   areas free of disturbance in protected areas should be considered,
   especially in the periods of high tourist visitation. This study
   highlights the need to monitor the effects of tourist activities on
   wildlife and to implement new policies in the management of protected
   areas.

TI DNA 5-Methylcytosine Demethylation Activities of the Mammalian DNA
   Methyltransferases
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Methylation at the 5-position of DNA cytosine on the vertebrate genomes
   is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three DNA
   methyltransferases (DNMTs), the de novo enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B and
   the maintenance enzyme DNMT1. Although several metabolic routes have
   been suggested for demethylation of the vertebrate DNA, whether active
   DNA demethylase(s) exist has remained elusive. Surprisingly, we have
   found that the mammalian DNMTs, and likely the vertebrates DNMTs in
   general, can also act as Ca2+ ion- and redox state-dependent active DNA
   demethylases. This finding suggests new directions for reinvestigation
   of the structures and functions of these DNMTs, in particular their
   roles in Ca2+ ion-dependent biological processes, including the
   genome-wide/local DNA demethylation during early embryogenesis, cell
   differentiation, neuronal activity-regulated gene expression, and
   carcinogenesis.

TI Different Roles for Tet1 and Tet2 Proteins in Reprogramming-Mediated
   Erasure of Imprints Induced by EGC Fusion
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Genonnic imprinting directs the allele-specific marking and expression
   of loci according to their parental origin. Differential DNA methylation
   at imprinted control regions (ICRs) is established in gametes and,
   although largely preserved through development, can be experimentally
   reset by fusing somatic cells with embryonic germ cell (EGG) lines.
   Here, we show that the Ten-Eleven Translocation proteins Tet1 and Tet2
   participate in the efficient erasure of imprints in this model system.
   The fusion of B cells with EGCs initiates pluripotent reprogramming, in
   which rapid re-expression of Oct4 is accompanied by an accumulation of
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at several ICRs. Tet2 was required for
   the efficient reprogramming capacity of EGCs, whereas Tet1 was necessary
   to induce 5-methylcytosine oxidation specifically at ICRs. These data
   show that the Tet1 and Tet2 proteins have discrete roles in
   cell-fusion-mediated pluripotent reprogramming and imprint erasure in
   somatic cells.

TI Hypoxic preconditioning increases triiodothyronine (T3) level in the
   developing rat brain
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the major
   causes of neurodegeneration and mortality in the neonatal period.
   Although hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) provided strong neuroprotection
   against HIE in an animal model, the mechanism underlying this effect is
   not fully understood especially in the immature brain. Here, we
   investigated whether thyroid hormones (THs), especially triiodothyronine
   (T3), which are essential during normal brain development, contribute to
   the neuroprotective mechanisms of HPC by using an established model of
   HPC in neonatal rats. HPC treatment (8% O-2 for 2.5 h at 37 degrees C)
   was performed in immature rats at postnatal day 6 (P6). Subsequently, we
   investigated the levels of THs, TH receptors (TRs) and type 2 and 3
   deiodinase (D2 and D3) mRNA, and glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) at 24 h
   after HPC treatment, and myelin basic protein (MBP) at 6, 12 and 24 h
   after HPC treatment. The HIE procedure was performed at 24 h after HPC,
   and the neuroprotective effect of HPC was assessed via
   microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MBP immunohistochemical
   staining at 14 days after HIE (P21). HPC treatment afforded marked
   neuroprotection at 14 days after HIE. The local level of T3 was
   upregulated 24 h after HPC treatment in the developing rat brain,
   probably via the upregulation of D2. In addition, the expression of MBP
   and GLT1, which are the downstream protein of T3, were significantly
   increased 24 h after HPC treatment. The present study indicates that
   thyroid hormones and their associated molecules may be involved in
   neuroprotective mechanisms of HPC during the developmental period. (C)

TI Rapid and Comprehensive Impurity Profiling of Synthetic Thyroxine by
   Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass
   Spectrometry
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Rapid and efficient quality control according to the public authority
   regulations is mandatory to guarantee safety of the pharmaceuticals and
   to save resources in the pharmaceutical industry. In the case of
   so-called "grandfather products" like the synthetic thyroid hormone
   thyroxine, strict regulations enforce a detailed chemical analysis in
   order to characterize potentially toxic or pharmacologically relevant
   impurities. We report a straightforward workflow for the comprehensive
   impurity profiling of synthetic thyroid hormones and impurities
   employing ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated
   to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Five different batches of
   synthetic thyroxin were analyzed resulting in the detection of 71
   impurities within 3 mm total analysis time. Structural elucidation of
   the compounds was accomplished via a combination of accurate mass
   measurements, computer based calculations of molecular formulas,
   multistage high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMSn), and nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which enabled the identification of 71
   impurities, of which 47 have been unknown so far. Thirty of the latter
   were structurally elucidated, including products of deiodination,
   aliphatic chain oxidation, as well as dimeric compounds as new class of
   thyroid hormone derivatives. Limits of detection for the thyroid
   compounds were in the 6 ng/mL range for negative electrospray ionization
   mass spectrometric detection in full scan mode. Within day and
   day-to-day repeatabilities of retention times and peak areas were below
   0.5% and 3.5% R.SD. The performance characteristics of the method in
   terms of robustness and information content clearly show that UHPLC-HRMS
   is adequate for the rapid and reliable detection, identification, and
   semiquantitative determination of trace levels of impurities in
   synthetic pharmaceuticals.

TI RegulatING chromatin regulators: post-translational modification of the
   ING family of epigenetic regulators
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB The five human ING genes encode at least 15 splicing isoforms, most of
   which affect cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis through their
   ability to alter gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms. Since their
   discovery in 1996, ING proteins have been classified as type II tumour
   suppressors on the basis of reports describing their down-regulation and
   mislocalization in a variety of cancer types. In addition to their
   regulation by transcriptional mechanisms, understanding the range of
   PTMs (post-translational modifications) of INGs is important in
   understanding how ING functions are fine-tuned in the physiological
   setting and how they add to the repertoire of activities affected by the
   INGs. In the present paper we review the different PTMs that have been
   reported to occur on INGs. We discuss the PTMs that modulate ING
   function under normal conditions and in response to a variety of
   stresses. We also describe the ING PTMs that have been identified by
   several unbiased MS-based PTM enrichment techniques and subsequent
   proteomic analysis. Among the ING PTMs identified to date, a subset has
   been characterized for their biological significance and have been shown
   to affect processes including subcellular localization, interaction with
   enzymatic complexes and ING protein half-life. The present review aims
   to highlight the emerging role of PTMs in regulating ING function and to
   suggest additional pathways and functions where PTMs may effect ING
   function.

TI Occupying Chromatin: Polycomb Mechanisms for Getting to Genomic Targets,
   Stopping Transcriptional Traffic, and Staying Put
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Chromatin modification by Polycomb proteins provides an essential
   strategy for gene silencing in higher eukaryotes. Polycomb repressive
   complexes (PRCs) silence key developmental regulators and are centrally
   integrated in the transcriptional circuitry of stem cells. PRC2
   trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and PRC1-type
   complexes ubiquitylate histone H2A and compact polynucleosomes. How PRCs
   are deployed to select and silence genomic targets is the subject of
   intense investigation. We review advances on targeting, modulation, and
   functions of PRC1 and PRC2 and progress on defining the transcriptional
   steps they impact. Recent findings emphasize PRC1 targeting independent
   of H3K27me3, nonenzymatic PRC1-mediated compaction, and connections
   between PRCs and noncoding RNAs. Systematic analyses of Polycomb
   complexes and associated histone modifications during DNA replication
   and mitosis have also emerged. The stage is now set to reveal
   fundamental epigenetic mechanisms that determine how Polycomb target
   genes are silenced and how Polycomb silence is preserved through
   cell-cycle progression.

TI Multiplexed Surrogate Analysis of Glycotransferase Activity in Whole
   Biospecimens
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Dysregulated glycotransferase enzymes in cancer cells produce aberrant
   glycans-some of which can help facilitate metastases. Within a cell,
   individual glycotransferases promiscuously help to construct dozens of
   unique glycan structures, making it difficult to comprehensively track
   their activity in biospecimens-especially where they are absent or
   inactive. Here, we describe an approach to deconstruct glycans in whole
   biospecimens then analytically pool together resulting
   monosaccharide-and-linkage-specific degradation products ("glycan
   nodes") that directly represent the activities of specific
   glycotransferases. To implement this concept, a reproducible, relative
   quantitation-based glycan methylation analysis methodology was developed
   that simultaneously captures information from N-, O-, and lipid linked
   glycans and is compatible with whole biofluids and homogenized tissues;
   in total, over 30 different glycan nodes are detectable per gas
   chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) run. Numerous nonliver organ
   cancers are known to induce the production of abnormally glycosylated
   serum proteins. Thus, following analytical validation, in blood plasma,
   the technique was applied to a group of 59 lung cancer patient plasma
   samples and age/gender/smoking-status-matched non-neoplastic controls
   from the Lung Cancer in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) study to gauge
   the clinical utility of the approach toward the detection of lung
   cancer. Ten smoking-independent glycan node ratios were found that
   detect lung cancer with individual receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) c-statistics ranging from 0.76 to 0.88. Two glycan nodes provided
   novel evidence for altered ST6Gal-I and GnT-IV glycotransferase
   activities in lung cancer patients. In summary, a conceptually novel
   approach to the analysis of glycans in unfractionated human biospecimens
   has been developed that, upon clinical validation for specific
   applications, may provide diagnostic and/or predictive information in
   glycan-altering diseases.

   The new signal appeared at 3.67 ppm in zein methylation product, which
   is absent for pure zein can be assigned to the protons of the CH3 group
   of an ester. The strong C?O stretching vibration due to the presence of
   ester group in the region of 1739 cm-1 in case of methylated zein was
   also noticed from FTIR studies. The increase in the C : N atom ratio in
   the zein methylation product obtained from elemental analysis results
   further indicates the conversion of a significant proportion of the
   ?CONH2 groups in zein to ?COOCH3 groups in the esterified product. The
   methylated product had glass transition temperature about 20 degrees C
   lower than that of the unmodified zein. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Yeast RNA polymerase III transcription factors and effectors
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Recent data indicate that the well-defined transcription machinery of
   RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is probably more complex than commonly
   thought. In this review, we describe the yeast basal transcription
   factors of Pol III and their involvements in the transcription cycle. We
   also present a list of proteins detected on genes transcribed by Pol III
   (class III genes) that might participate in the transcription process.
   Surprisingly, several of these proteins are involved in RNA polymerase
   II transcription. Defining the role of these potential new effectors in
   Pol III transcription in vivo will be the challenge of the next few
   years. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcription

TI Long-term response in high-grade optic glioma treated with medically
   induced hypothyroidism and carboplatin: a case report and review of the
   literature
SO ANTI-CANCER DRUGS
AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant and frequent brain
   tumor, with an aggressive growth pattern and poor prognosis despite best
   treatment modalities. Long-term survival of patients with GBM is rare.
   Optic glioma represents 0.6-1.2% of all brain tumors. Unlike low-grade
   optic gliomas in children, optic gliomas in adults are highly aggressive
   and death usually occurs in less than a year. Prolonged progression-free
   survival and survival rates have been reported in association with
   induced hypothyroidism in two clinical trials for recurrent GBM. We
   present the clinical, radiological, and pathological findings in a
   patient with inoperable GBM of the optic chiasm. Following failure of
   initial, standard radiation and temozolomide therapy, chemical
   hypothyroidism was induced using the antithyroid thioamide,
   propylthiouracil, followed by carboplatin chemotherapy. Initial thyroid
   stimulating hormone, free T4, and free T3 analysis was carried out and
   then monthly. This patient responded rapidly to treatment (clinically
   and with tumor regression within 4 weeks) on two separate occasions with
   an extended remission period (2.5 years) and prolonged overall survival
   (4.5 years). We report the successful long-term tumor response to
   medically induced chemical hypothyroidism in conjunction with
   carboplatinum chemotherapy of an adult patient with grade IV GBM of the
   optic chiasm. These clinical observations find mechanistic support from
   the recent identification of potent mitogenic actions of the thyroid
   hormone, L-thyroxine, in malignant glioma through binding to a cognate
   thyroid hormone receptor on the alpha v beta 3 integrin. Approaches to
   block its activity are now explored in preclinical studies. Anti-Cancer

TI Multiple TSC22D4 iso-/phospho-glycoforms display idiosyncratic
   subcellular localizations and interacting protein partners
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB Proteins of the TSC22 domain (TSC22D) family, including TSC22D1 and
   TSC22D4, play pivotal roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and
   apoptosis, interacting with other factors in a still largely unknown
   manner. This study explores this issue by biochemically characterizing
   various TSC22D4 forms (both iso- and glyco-phospho-, namely the splice
   variants 42 and 55 kDa and the post-translationally modified 67 and 72
   kDa forms) and their subcellular localization and protein partners
   during cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) differentiation. The TSC22D4-42
   form is mostly cytosolic, and is the only TSC22D4 form that associates
   with TSC22D1.2 in undifferentiated but not differentiated CGNs. In
   contrast, TSC22D4-55 is prominently associated with the nuclear matrix
   in differentiated but not undifferentiated CGNs. As for TSC22D4-67, it
   is localized in the cytosol and nuclei of undifferentiated CGNs and
   enters mitochondria of differentiated CGNs, associating with
   apoptosis-inducing factor. TSC22D4-72 is modified by O-linked
   beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylated) and phosphorylated and is
   always associated with chromatin irrespective of CGN differentiation.
   The various subcellular localization patterns and interacting protein
   partners of TSC22D4 forms during CGN differentiation suggest the
   existence of form-specific function(s) and provide a novel framework to
   further investigate the biological functions of TSC22D proteins.

TI Hypermorphic expression of centromeric retroelement-encoded small RNAs
   impairs CENP-A loading
SO CHROMOSOME RESEARCH
AB The proper functioning of centromeres requires a complex cascade of
   epigenetic events involving chromatin and kinetochore assembly; however,
   the precise mechanism by which this cascade proceeds is unknown. The
   pivotal event during kinetochore formation is the "loading," or
   deposition, of CENP-A. This histone H3 variant is specific to
   centromeres and replaces conventional H3 in centromeric chromatin.
   Failure to load CENP-A into mammalian centromeres in late
   telophase/early G1 of the cell cycle leads to malsegregation and cell
   division defects in subsequent cell cycles. Mounting evidence supports
   the hypothesis that an RNA component is involved, although how RNAs
   participate in centromere formation in mammals has remained unknown.
   Using the marsupial model, the tammar wallaby, we show that centromeric
   retroelements produce small RNAs and that hypermorphic expression of
   these centromeric small RNAs results in disruption of CENP-A
   localization. We propose that tight regulation of the processing of this
   new class of small RNAs, crasiRNAs, is an integral component of the
   epigenetic framework necessary for centromere establishment.

TI Secretome proteins as candidate biomarkers for aggressive thyroid
   carcinomas
SO PROTEOMICS
AB Using proteomics in tandem with bioinformatics, the secretomes of
   nonaggressive and aggressive thyroid carcinoma (TC) cell lines were
   analyzed to detect potential biomarkers for tumor aggressiveness. A
   panel of nine proteins, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule
   (ALCAM/CD166), tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (AXL), amyloid beta A4
   protein, amyloid-like protein 2, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein
   K, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2, phosphatase 2A
   inhibitor (SET), and protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1 (143-3 zeta)
   was chosen to confirm their expression in TC patients' sera and tissues.
   Increased presurgical circulating levels of ALCAM were associated with
   aggressive tumors (p = 0.04) and presence of lymph node metastasis (p =
   0.018). Increased serum AXL levels were associated with extrathyroidal
   extension (p = 0.027). Furthermore, differential expression of amyloid
   beta A4 protein, AXL, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K,
   phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2, and SET
   was observed in TC tissues compared to benign nodules. Decreased nuclear
   expression of AXL can detect malignancy with 90% specificity and 100%
   sensitivity (AUC = 0.995, p < 0.001). In conclusion, some of these
   proteins show potential for future development as serum and/or
   tissue-based biomarkers for TC and warrant further investigation in a
   large cohort of patients.

TI LIM-homeobox transcription factor 1, alpha (LMX1A) inhibits
   tumourigenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem-like
   properties of epithelial ovarian cancer
SO GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
AB Objective. We reported recently the hypermethylation of LMX1A, a
   LIM-homeobox gene, as a prognostic biomarker in ovarian cancer; however,
   the function of LMX1A in ovarian cancer remains unknown. The present
   study aimed to evaluate the hypothesized tumour-suppressor functions of
   LMX1A in ovarian cancer.
   Methods. We analysed the function of LMX1A by examining cell lines,
   animal models and human ovarian cancer tissues. Overexpression of LMX1A
   in relation to chemotherapy was also analysed.
   Results. The expression of LMX1A inhibited cell proliferation,
   migration, invasion and colony formation in vitro, as well as
   tumourigenicity in a xenotransplantation mouse model. LMX1A also
   sensitized ovarian cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutics, and affected
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The restoration of LMX1A
   down-regulated stem cell markers and inhibited tumour spheroid formation
   in SKOV3 cells. Univariate analysis of immunohistochemical staining of
   tissue arrays (n = 83) revealed that low LMX1A expression was
   significantly associated with advanced stages (p = 0.001), poor
   differentiation (p<0.001), early recurrence (p = 0.023) and poor overall
   survival (p = 0.042) in ovarian cancer.
   Conclusions. The present study demonstrated, for the first time, that
   LMX1A is a bona fide tumour suppressor of ovarian cancer. The prognostic
   values of LMX1A may provide a biomarker for personalized treatments of
   ovarian cancer patients. The mechanisms of LMX1A in EMT and stem-like
   properties in ovarian cancer warrant further investigation. (C) 2012

TI Regulation of MicroRNAs by Brahma-related Gene 1 (Brg1) in Smooth Muscle
   Cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB MicroRNAs are involved in phenotypic switching of smooth muscle cells
   (SMCs). Brg1-containing SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes also play
   an important role in controlling the phenotype of SMCs. We thus
   determined whether Brg1 influences the transcription of microRNAs in
   SMCs. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of smooth muscle from
   mice harboring smooth muscle-specific deletion of Brg1 revealed altered
   expression of several microRNAs, including miRs-143/145 and miR-133.
   Ablation of Brg1 in SMCs in vitro either by expression of dominant
   negative Brg1 or Brg1 knock-out attenuated miRs-143/145 expression.
   Knockdown of serum response factor (SRF) in SMCs significantly reduced
   the expression levels of miRs-143/145 and miR-133, whereas knockdown of
   myocardin only attenuated miRs-143/145 expression. Myocardin induced
   expression of miRs-143/145 and miR-133a and increased SRF binding to
   these genes in 10T1/2 cells. This myocardin-mediated induction was
   attenuated by dominant negative Brg1. In Brg1-null SW13 cells,
   miRs-143/145 were dramatically induced by myocardin only in the presence
   of Brg1, whereas miR-133 was not induced by myocardin in a
   Brg1-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated
   that in the presence of Brg1, myocardin increased SRF binding to both
   the miRs-143/145 and miR-133a loci. Together, these data suggest a
   mechanism in which Brg1-containing SWI/SNF complexes are required for
   myocardin to induce expression of miRs-143/145 in smooth muscle cells.
   In contrast, miR-133 expression appears to be regulated by
   Brg1-containing chromatin remodeling complexes in a partially
   SRF-dependent, although largely myocardin-independent manner.
   SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling thus regulates the phenotype of
   smooth muscle by affecting expression of protein-coding genes and
   microRNAs.

TI MicroRNA-124a Is Epigenetically Regulated and Acts as a Tumor Suppressor
   by Controlling Multiple Targets in Uveal Melanoma
SO INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE
AB PURPOSE. MicroRNA-124a (miR-124a), an abundant microRNA in the central
   neuron system, has been linked to tumor progression. Here, we
   investigated the role of miR-124a in uveal melanoma development.
   METHODS. Expression of miR-124a in uveal melanoma cells was examined
   using real time RT-PCR. The effect of miR-124a on cell proliferation,
   migration, and invasion was analyzed using MTS assay, flow cytometry,
   and transwell experiments. The ability of miR-124a to repress tumor
   growth was tested in vivo. Target genes of miR-124a were first predicted
   by bioinformatics, confirmed using a luciferase assay, and their
   expression determined by Western blotting. DNA methylation and histone
   modification of miR-124a was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR and
   ChIP assay. Finally, epigenetic drugs were used to alter the expression
   of miR-124a.
   RESULTS. miR-124a expression was downregulated in both uveal melanoma
   cells and clinical specimens. Transient transfection of miR-124a into
   uveal melanoma cells inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion.
   Moreover, introduction of miR-124a suppressed in vivo growth of tumor.
   Potential targets of miR-124a were found to include CDK4, CDK6, cyclin
   D2, and EZH2. Knockdown of EZH2 by siRNA resulted in inhibition of uveal
   melanoma cell migration and invasion. In addition, miR-124a expression
   was found to be regulated via epigenetic mechanisms, with its expression
   restored when cells were treated with a DNA hypomethylating agent,
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and a histone deacetylase inhibitor,
   trichostatin A.
   CONCLUSIONS. Our results demonstrated that miR-124a could function as a
   potent tumor suppressor by regulation of multiple targets, and was
   epigenetically silenced in the development of uveal melanoma. (Invest

TI ProteinProtein Interactions in the Regulation of WRKY Transcription
   Factors
SO MOLECULAR PLANT
AB WRKY transcription factors play important roles in plant growth,
   development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. This review
   summarizes progress in our understanding of the regulation of WRKY
   transcription factors through analysis of a wide range of
   WRKY-interacting proteins with roles in signaling, transcription, and
   chromosome remodeling.It has been almost 20 years since the first report
   of a WRKY transcription factor, SPF1, from sweet potato. Great progress
   has been made since then in establishing the diverse biological roles of
   WRKY transcription factors in plant growth, development, and responses
   to biotic and abiotic stress. Despite the functional diversity, almost
   all analyzed WRKY proteins recognize the TTGACC/T W-box sequences and,
   therefore, mechanisms other than mere recognition of the core W-box
   promoter elements are necessary to achieve the regulatory specificity of
   WRKY transcription factors. Research over the past several years has
   revealed that WRKY transcription factors physically interact with a wide
   range of proteins with roles in signaling, transcription, and chromatin
   remodeling. Studies of WRKY-interacting proteins have provided important
   insights into the regulation and mode of action of members of the
   important family of transcription factors. It has also emerged that the
   slightly varied WRKY domains and other protein motifs conserved within
   each of the seven WRKY subfamilies participate in proteinprotein
   interactions and mediate complex functional interactions between WRKY
   proteins and between WRKY and other regulatory proteins in the
   modulation of important biological processes. In this review, we
   summarize studies of proteinprotein interactions for WRKY transcription
   factors and discuss how the interacting partners contribute, at
   different levels, to the establishment of the complex regulatory and
   functional network of WRKY transcription factors.

TI Immunomodulatory activity of SGI-110, a 5-aza-2
   '-deoxycytidine-containing demethylating dinucleotide
SO CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
AB Pharmacologic DNA hypomethylation holds strong promises in cancer
   immunotherapy due to its immunomodulatory activity on neoplastic cells.
   Searching for more efficient DNA hypomethylating agents to be utilized
   to design novel immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer, we investigated
   the immunomodulatory properties of the new DNA hypomethylating agent
   SGI-110, that is resistant to in vivo inactivation by cytidine
   deaminase.
   Cutaneous melanoma, mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, and sarcoma
   cells were treated in vitro with SGI-110. RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR,
   quantitative methylation-specific PCR, and flow cytometric analyses were
   performed to investigate changes induced by SGI-110 in the constitutive
   immune profile of cancer cells. The recognition by gp100-specific CTL of
   gp100-positive melanoma cells, treated or not with SGI-110, was tested
   by LDH release assays.
   SGI-110 induced/up-regulated the expression of investigated
   cancer/testis antigens (CTA) (i.e., MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4,
   MAGE-A10, GAGE 1-2, GAGE 1-6, NY-ESO-1, and SSX 1-5) in all cancer cell
   lines studied, both at mRNA and at protein levels. Quantitative
   methylation-specific PCR analyses identified a hypomethylation of
   MAGE-A1 and NY-ESO-1 promoters in SGI-110-treated neoplastic cells,
   demonstrating a direct role of pharmacologic DNA demethylation in CTA
   induction. SGI-110 also up-regulated the expression of HLA class I
   antigens and of ICAM-1, resulting in an improved recognition of cancer
   cells by gp100-specific CTL.
   Our findings show that SGI-110 is a highly attractive therapeutic agent
   to comprehensively increase immunogenicity and immune recognition of
   neoplastic cells, and provide the scientific rationale for its clinical
   development to design novel chemo-immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer
   patients.

TI Acute myeloid leukemia with translocation (8:16)(p11;p13) and

   targeting RET proto-oncogene
SO LEUKEMIA
AB Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;6)(p11;p13) (t(81 6) AML) has
   unique clinico-biological characteristics, but its microRNA pattern is
   unknown. We analyzed 670 microRNAs in seven patients with t(8;16) AML
   and 113 with other AML subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed
   that all t(8;16) AML patients grouped in an independent cluster.
   Supervised analysis revealed a distinctive signature of 94-microRNAs,
   most of which were downregulated, including miR-21 and cluster
   miR-17-92. The mRNA expression analysis of two known transcription
   factors of these microRNAs (STAT3 and c-Myc, respectively) showed
   significant downregulation of STAT3 (P=0.04). A bioinformatic analysis
   showed that 29 of the downregulated microRNAs might be regulated by
   methylation; we treated a t(81 6) AML sample with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
   (5-AZA-dC) and trichostatin A and found that 27 microRNAs were
   re-expressed after treatment. However, there was no difference in
   methylation status between t(8;16) and other AML subtypes, either
   overall or in the microRNA promoter. Cross-correlation of mRNA and
   microRNA expression identified RET as a potential target of several
   microRNAs. A Renilla-luciferase assay and flow cytometry after
   transfection with pre-microRNAs confirmed that RET is regulated by
   miR-218, nniR-128, miR-27b, miR-15a and miR-195. In conclusion, t(8;16)
   AML harbors a specific microRNA signature that is partially
   epigenetically regulated and targets RET proto-oncogene. Leukemia (2013)

   methyltransferase (AS3MT). Here we examine associations between AS3MT
   polymorphism, arsenic metabolism and diabetes. Fasting blood glucose,
   oral glucose tolerance and self-reported diagnoses were used to identify
   diabetic individuals. Inorganic arsenic and its metabolites were
   measured in urine. Genotyping analysis focused on six polymorphic sites
   of AS3MT. Individuals with M287T and G4965C polymorphisms had higher
   levels of urinary DMAs(III) and were more frequently diabetic than the
   respective wild-type carriers, although the excess was not statistically
   significant. Odds ratios were 11.4 (95% confidence interval (CI)
   2.2-58.8) and 8.8 (95% CI 1.6-47.3) for the combined effects of arsenic
   exposure > 75th percentile and 287T and 4965C genotypes, respectively.
   Carriers of 287T and 4965C may produce more DMAs(III) and be more likely
   to develop diabetes when exposed to arsenic. Journal of Exposure Science

SO CORAL REEFS
AB An encrusting red alga (Ramicrusta sp., Peyssonneliaceae) present in Lac
   Bay, Bonaire, overgrows and kills corals and other sessile organisms.
   Living coral tissue comprises 7.2 % of the benthic composition of the
   shallow reef, while Ramicrusta sp. covers 18.7 % of the substratum. Of
   1374 coral colonies surveyed, 45.8 % were partially overgrown by
   Ramicrusta sp., with P. porites, P. astreoides and M. complanata being
   the most susceptible to overgrowth. Mean Ramicrusta sp. maximum
   overgrowth rates +/- A SD were 0.08 +/- A 0.05 mm d(-1), 0.07 +/- A 0.03
   mm d(-1) and 0.06 +/- A 0.02 mm d(-1) for M. complanata, P. porites and
   P. astreoides, respectively. None of the 71 coral recruits surveyed were
   growing on Ramicrusta sp. Ramicrusta sp. is an immediate threat to
   corals, reduces the area of suitable substratum for coral settlement and
   may have the ability to influence coral species composition.

TI The Effect of Scrubbing Hands with Iodine-Containing Solutions on
   Urinary Iodine Concentrations of the Operating Room Staff
SO THYROID
AB Background: Excessive iodine exposure is associated with thyroid
   dysfunction and thyroid autoimmunity. Most surgical hand-scrub solutions
   contain large amounts of iodine, and transcutaneous and mucosal
   absorption of iodine from these antiseptic solutions has been
   demonstrated. In this study we determined the effect of hand scrubbing
   with iodine-containing surgical hand-scrub solutions on urinary iodine
   concentrations (UICs) in operating room staff.
   Methods: The study included 117 surgeons and surgical nurses from two
   different hospitals who often used surgical hand-scrub solutions as the
   iodine exposure group and 92 age-matched hospital staff from nonsurgical
   units of the same hospitals as the controls. In the iodine exposure
   group, 39 subjects (from hospital 1) used iodine-containing hand scrub
   solutions intermittently, and the remaining 78 in the surgical staff
   (from hospital 2) used only iodine-containing hand-scrub solutions.
   Morning spot urine specimens were collected from all participants for
   the analysis of UIC.
   Results: The operating room staff had significantly higher UICs compared
   to the control group (142 mu g/L [12-822 mu g/L] vs. 89 mu g/L [10-429
   mu g/L], p < 0.001). UICs from 39% of the subjects from hospital 2 were
   found to reach levels higher than 300 mu g/L.
   Conclusion: Scrubbing with iodine-containing solutions might lead to
   iodine excess among surgical staff. Further studies investigating the
   effects of hand scrubbing with iodine-containing products on thyroid
   function and on thyroid antibodies of the operating room staff are
   needed to determine the consequences of this high iodine exposure.

TI Do wood fibers from a pulp mill affect the distribution of total and
   methyl mercury in river sediments?
SO JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
AB The St. Lawrence River near Cornwall Ontario is affected by industrial
   mercury contamination of sediments and biota. It has been suggested that
   pulp and paper mill effluents may stimulate bacterial mercury
   methylation in these sediments, leading to contamination of aquatic
   biota. To test this hypothesis, we examined sediment-porewater dynamics
   of total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) at a site with high
   concentrations of wood fibers from a pulp and paper mill effluent and a
   nearby reference site with low wood fiber content. Dissolved phase THg
   (THg(diss)) and MeHg (MeHg(diss)) in porewater profiles showed that 38
   +/- 30.9% (SD) of THg in porewaters was in the methylated form
   regardless of wood fiber content. MeHg(diss) and THg(diss)
   concentrations were homogeneous between porewater and overlying water,
   indicating (a) that there is minimal net diffusion of MeHg(diss) and
   THg(diss) and (b) that redox-dependent processes such as sulfate
   reduction and Fe reduction were not associated with MeHg(diss)
   distribution in these sediment profiles. MeHg and THg in solid phase
   showed coincident subsurface peaks at depths >40 cm suggesting either
   that historical deposits of MeHg on particles (MeHg((p))) are preserved
   in deep sediments, or that Hg methylation is active in deep sediments.

TI Establishment of the Trimester-Specific Reference Range for Free
   Thyroxine Index
SO THYROID
AB Background: Accurate assessment of thyroid status during pregnancy is
   vital for maternal and fetal health. Because free thyroxine (FT4) values
   in pregnancy vary widely between methods, assessment of total T4 (TT4)
   and FT4 index (FT4I) may be superior to FT4 in pregnant women. However,
   trimester-specific reference intervals for FT4I have not yet been
   established. In this longitudinal self-sequential survey, we aimed at
   determining the trimester-specific reference range for FT4I in healthy
   Iranian women with singleton pregnancies.
   Methods: A total of 466 healthy pregnant women were evaluated. After
   exclusion of women with history, ultrasonographic, or laboratory
   evidence of any thyroid disorder or iodine deficiency and those who were
   positive for thyroid autoantibodies, 152 women entered the study. Serum
   thyrotropin (TSH), TT4, and triiodothyronine-resine uptake were measured
   by an immunoassay method. Reference intervals were defined as 5th and
   95th percentiles, using the bootstrap-based procedure.
   Results: Mean values in the first, second, and third trimesters were 1.7
   +/- 1.5, 1.9 +/- 1.8, and 1.9 +/- 1.8mIU/L for TSH; 12.9 +/- 3, 14.4 +/-
   3.1, and 13.6 +/- 3.3 mu g/dL for TT4; and 12.8 +/- 3.5, 14.2 +/- 3.3,
   and 13.5 +/- 3.8 for FT4I, respectively. Reference intervals in the
   first, second, and third trimesters were as follows (respectively):
   TSH-0.2-3.9, 0.5-4.1, and 0.6-4.1 mIU/L; TT4-8.2-18.5, 10.1-20.6, and
   9-19.4 mu g/dL; and FT4I-8.5-19, 9.7-21, and 8.7-20.4. Serum TSH had no
   significant correlation with TT4. Serum TSH had a significant but weak
   correlation with FT4I only in the first trimester (r = -0.24, p =
   0.006).
   Conclusion: This study, for the first time, establishes the
   trimester-specific reference intervals for FT4I in a reference
   population of normal iodine-sufficient pregnant Iranian women.

TI Synthesizing larval competence dynamics and reef-scale retention reveals
   a high potential for self-recruitment in corals
SO ECOLOGY
AB Many organisms have a complex life-cycle in which dispersal occurs at
   the propagule stage. For marine environments, there is growing evidence
   that high levels of recruitment back to the natal population
   (self-recruitment) are common in many marine organisms. For fish,
   swimming behavior is frequently invoked as a key mechanism allowing high
   self-recruitment. For organisms with weak-swimming larvae, such as many
   marine invertebrates, the mechanisms behind self-recruitment are less
   clear. Here, we assessed whether the combination of passive retention of
   larvae due to re-circulation processes near reefs, and the dynamics of
   settlement competence, can produce the high levels of self-recruitment
   previously estimated by population genetic studies for reef-building
   corals. Additionally, we investigated whether time to motility, which is
   more readily measurable than competence parameters, can explain the
   between-species variation in self-recruitment. We measured the larval
   competence dynamics of broadcast-spawning and brooding corals and
   incorporated these in a model of larval retention around reefs to
   estimate the potential for self-recruitment and assess its variation
   among species and reefs. Our results suggest that the larvae of many
   corals, even those with an obligate planktonic phase, develop with
   sufficient rapidity to allow high levels of self-recruitment,
   particularly for reefs with long water retention times. Time to motility
   explained 77-86% of the between-species variation in potential
   self-recruitment in scenarios with a realistic range of retention times.
   Among broadcast spawners, time to motility was strongly and positively
   correlated with egg size, i.e., broadcast spawner species with small
   eggs developed more rapidly and exhibited greater potential for
   self-recruitment. These findings suggest that, along with water
   retention estimates, easy-to-measure species traits, such as egg size
   and time to motility, may be good predictors of potential
   self-recruitment, and therefore may be used to characterize the spectrum
   of self-recruitment in corals.

TI The role of Nup98 in transcription regulation in healthy and diseased
   cells
SO TRENDS IN CELL BIOLOGY
AB Nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins are known for their critical roles
   in regulating nucleocytoplasmic traffic of macromolecules across the
   nuclear envelope. However, recent findings suggest that some
   nucleoporins (Nups), including Nup98, have additional functions in
   developmental gene regulation. Nup98, which exhibits
   transcription-dependent mobility at the NPC but can also bind chromatin
   away from the nuclear envelope, is frequently involved in chromosomal
   translocations in a subset of patients suffering from acute myeloid
   leukemia (AML). A common paradigm suggests that Nup98 translocations
   cause aberrant transcription when they are recuited to aberrant genomic
   loci. Importantly, this model fails to account for the potential loss of
   wild type (WT) Nup98 function in the presence of Nup98 translocation
   mutants. Here we examine how the cell might regulate Nup98 nucleoplasmic
   protein levels to control transcription in healthy cells. In addition,
   we discuss the possibility that dominant negative Nup98 fusion proteins
   disrupt the transcriptional activity of WT Nup98 in the nucleoplasm to
   drive AML.

TI Cross-sensitization between cocaine and acute restraint stress is
   associated with sensitized dopamine but not glutamate release in the
   nucleus accumbens
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs or stress can elicit a
   sensitized response to the stimulating and reinforcing properties of the
   drug. Here we explore the mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   whereby an acute restraint stress augments the acute locomotor response
   to cocaine. This was accomplished by a combination of behavioral
   pharmacology, microdialysis measures of extracellular dopamine and
   glutamate, and Western blotting for GluR1 subunit of the
   -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate
   receptor (AMPAR). A single exposure to restraint stress 3weeks before
   testing revealed that enduring locomotor sensitization to cocaine was
   paralleled by an increase in extracellular dopamine in the core, but not
   the shell subcompartment, of the NAc. Wistar rats pre-exposed to acute
   stress showed increased basal levels of glutamate in the core, but the
   increase in glutamate by acute cocaine was blunted. The alterations in
   extracellular glutamate seem to be relevant, as blocking AMPAR by
   6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione microinjection into the core
   prevented both the behavioral cross-sensitization and the augmented
   increase in cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine. Further implicating
   glutamate, the locomotor response to AMPAR stimulation in the core was
   potentiated, but not in the shell of pre-stressed animals, and this was
   accompanied by an increase in NAc GluR1 surface expression. This study
   provides evidence that the long-term expression of restraint
   stress-induced behavioral cross-sensitization to cocaine recapitulates
   some mechanisms thought to underpin the sensitization induced by daily
   cocaine administration, and shows that long-term neurobiological changes
   induced in the NAc by acute stress are consequential in the expression
   of cross-sensitization to cocaine.

TI SPECT/CT Evaluation of Unusual Physiologic Radioiodine Biodistributions:
   Pearls and Pitfalls in Image Interpretation
SO RADIOGRAPHICS
AB Radioiodine imaging has a well-established role in depicting metastatic
   disease after thyroidectomy in patients with well-differentiated thyroid
   cancer. Uptake of radioiodine in thyroid metastases depends on
   expression of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) by tumor tissues. However,
   because radioiodine may also accumulate in normal structures and
   tissues, it is important to distinguish physiologic radioiodine activity
   from metastatic disease. Furthermore, secretions that contain
   radioiodine may also simulate pathologic uptake. A spectrum of
   physiologic distributions, normal variants, and benign mimics of disease
   have been described in the literature; yet, even when armed with a
   comprehensive knowledge of these patterns, interpreting radiologists and
   nuclear physicians may still encounter diagnostic uncertainty.
   Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with integrated
   computed tomography (CT) is a novel technology that, when applied to
   diagnostic iodine 123 or iodine 131 (I-131) radioiodine scintigraphy,
   may accurately localize and help distinguish benign mimics of disease,
   with the potential to alter the management plan. SPECT/CT is
   increasingly being used with radioiodine scintigraphy to evaluate
   patients with thyroid cancer and shows promise for improving imaging
   specificity and reducing false-positive results. (C)RSNA, 2013 center

TI Can Minimally Invasive Follicular Thyroid Cancer be Approached as a
   Benign Lesion?
SO ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Minimally invasive follicular thyroid cancer (MIFC) is an encapsulated
   follicular tumor of low malignant potential. To date, histological
   criteria are still under debate, and there are no population-level data
   regarding characteristics and outcomes of patients with MIFC.
   Patients diagnosed with MIFC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER) database from 2000 to 2009 were included. Summary
   statistics were utilized to analyze patient characteristics;
   Kaplan-Meier analysis, and one-sample log-rank test were performed.
   A total of 1,200 patients with MIFC and 4,208 with widely invasive
   follicular thyroid cancer (WIFC) were identified over 10 years of
   follow-up. MIFC was more common than WIFC in younger patients (mean age
   49 vs. 52.3 years; p < 0.001). More patients with MIFC were alive at the
   end of follow-up (96.8 vs. 86.5 % WIFC; p < 0.001). Patients diagnosed
   with MIFC were less likely than those with WIFC to have lymph nodes
   involved and distant metastases (0.9 vs. 3.6 % and 0.5 vs. 8.9 %,
   respectively; both p < 0.001). Only 2 of 1,200 patients died of
   disease-specific causes; overall survival was comparable to the general
   US population (p = 0.16). Total thyroidectomy and RAI ablation were not
   associated with improvement in patient outcomes (p = 0.2 and 0.443,
   respectively).
   MIFC is associated with survival comparable to that of the normative US
   general population. Thyroid lobectomy alone may be considered adequate
   treatment in these patients.

TI Neonatal (+)-methamphetamine exposure in rats alters adult locomotor
   responses to dopamine D(1) and D(2) agonists and to a glutamate NMDA

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Neonatal exposure to (+)-methamphetamine (Meth) results in long-term
   behavioural abnormalities but its developmental mechanisms are unknown.
   In a series of experiments, rats were treated from post-natal days (PD)
   11-20 (stage that approximates human development from the second to
   third trimester) with Meth or saline and assessed using locomotor
   activity as the readout following pharmacological challenge doses with
   dopamine, serotonin and glutamate agonists or antagonists during
   adulthood. Exposure to Meth early in life resulted in an exaggerated
   adult locomotor hyperactivity response to the dopamine D(1) agonist
   SKF-82958 at multiple doses, a high dose only under-response activating
   effect of the D(2) agonist quinpirole, and an exaggerated under-response
   to the activating effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor
   antagonist, MK-801. No change in locomotor response was seen following
   challenge with the 5-HT releaser p-chloroamphetamine or the 5-HT(2/3)
   receptor agonist, quipazine. These are the first data to show that PD
   11-20 Meth exposure induces long-lasting alterations to dopamine D(1),
   D(2) and glutamate NMDA receptor function and may suggest how
   developmental Meth exposure leads to many of its long-term adverse
   effects.

TI Clustering of place of birth for women with breast cancer: differences
   by tumor characteristics
SO CANCER CAUSES & CONTROL
AB There is increasing evidence that exposures in early life affect breast
   cancer risk, and that breast cancer etiology differs by tumor subtype.
   If environmental exposures in early life contribute to risk, it is
   expected that there would be clustering of women with breast cancer by
   their place of birth, and that clustering might differ by subtype. We
   examined spatial associations between place of birth and breast cancer
   by subtype, using hormone receptor status and molecular profiles of
   breast tumors.
   Data were drawn from the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer
   study, a population-based case-control study of incident, pathologically
   confirmed breast cancer (1996-2001) in Erie and Niagara Counties.
   Included were women born in the study area (579 cases and 931 controls).
   Clustering of breast cancer subgroups relative to controls was examined
   by the k-function method in groups stratified by estrogen receptor (ER),
   progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status, and by DNA methylation
   status and p53 mutation status, and the k-function difference was used
   to compare relative spatial aggregation and spatial range of the
   difference between case subgroups and controls.
   We found a tendency to cluster among ER positive, PR positive, and HER2
   negative cases (i.e., luminal A subtype), especially among premenopausal
   women, but not among the other groups defined by hormonal receptor
   status, or by either methylation or p53 mutation status.
   While our findings cannot rule out clustering of cases by birth place
   because of shared behaviors related to residence location, they also
   suggest that early life environmental exposures may affect subsequent
   breast cancer risk, and that premenopausal breast tumors of the luminal
   A subtype may be more affected by these early life exposures than other
   subtypes.

   through meiosis I error. Three other GCTs with whole UPD and homozygous
   centromeric regions of all chromosomes may have occurred through
   endoreduplication of a haploid set in an ovum or testis. The other 22
   GCTs had heterozygous centromeric regions of all chromosomes and no or a
   small number of segmental or whole UPDs and may have developed from
   premeiotic PGCs before imprint erasure or a reestablishment of
   imprinting. Gain and amplification of 3p24-p22 and 20q13-q13, and loss
   and UPD of 1p36-p35, 4q21-q21, 5q11-q13, and 6q26-qter were found in
   five or more tumors. 1p36-p35 loss was frequent, and found in 19 tumors;
   RUNX3 residing at 1p36 was methylated in the promoter regions of 16
   tumors. Two yolk sac tumors with many segmental UPDs or whole UPD of all
   chromosomes had gain of 20q13-q13 and loss of 1p36-p35, and seven or
   eight methylated TSGs. These genetic and epigenetic alterations may have
   caused malignant transformation because they were rarely found in
   teratomas with segmental or whole UPDs. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI VIEWPOINT Increasing incidence of thyroid cancer: controversies explored
SO NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence
   has been increasing considerably in the past few decades. Many studies
   have been published providing evidence for this increase; however, why
   thyroid cancer incidence keeps rising is still debated and there are
   conflicting reports of factors leading to the increase in its incidence.
   In this article, Nature Reviews Endocrinology asks four experts their
   opinions on some of the controversies surrounding the changing trends in
   thyroid cancer incidence. Ito, Y. et al. Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 9,

TI Increased Alternative Lengthening of Telomere Phenotypes of
   Telomerase-negative Immortal Cells upon Trichostatin - A Treatment
SO ANTICANCER RESEARCH
AB Human immortal cells maintain their telomeres either by telomerase or by
   alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) that is based on homologous
   telomeric recombination. Previous studies showed that the ALT mechanism
   is activated in non-ALT cells when heterochromatic features are reduced.
   In this study, we examined the ALT phenotypes of ALT cells after
   treatment with trichostatin-A (TSA), which is an inhibitor of histone
   deacetylases and causes global chromatin decondensation. The ALT cells
   remained telomerase-negative after TSA treatment. ALT-associated
   promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and telomere sister
   chromatid exchanges, typical ALT phenotypes, markedly increased in the
   TSA-treated cells, while the telomere length remained unchanged. In
   addition, telomerase expression in the ALT cells suppressed TSA-mediated
   ALT phenotype enhancement. Our results show that certain ALT phenotypes
   become more pronounced when chromatin is decondensed, and also suggest
   that the ALT mechanism may compete with telomerase for telomere
   maintenance in cells that lack heterochromatin.

TI Sirtuin7 oncogenic potential in human hepatocellular carcinoma and its
   regulation by the tumor suppressors MiR-125a-5p and MiR-125b
SO HEPATOLOGY
AB Sirtuins are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized form
   (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases and function in cellular metabolism,
   stress resistance, and aging. For sirtuin7 (SIRT7), a role in ribosomal
   gene transcription is proposed, but its function in cancer has been
   unclear. In this study we show that SIRT7 expression was up-regulated in
   a large cohort of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. SIRT7
   knockdown influenced the cell cycle and caused a significant increase of
   liver cancer cells to remain in the G1/S phase and to suppress growth.
   This treatment restored p21WAF1/Cip1, induced Beclin-1, and repressed
   cyclin D1. In addition, sustained suppression of SIRT7 reduced the in
   vivo tumor growth rate in a mouse xenograft model. To explore mechanisms
   in SIRT7 regulation, microRNA (miRNA) profiling was carried out. This
   identified five significantly down-regulated miRNAs in HCC.
   Bioinformatics analysis of target sites and ectopic expression in HCC
   cells showed that miR-125a-5p and miR-125b suppressed SIRT7 and cyclin
   D1 expression and induced p21WAF1/Cip1-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest.
   Furthermore, treatment of HCC cells with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine or
   ectopic expression of wildtype but not mutated p53 restored miR-125a-5p
   and miR-125b expression and inhibited tumor cell growth, suggesting
   their regulation by promoter methylation and p53 activity. To show the
   clinical significance of these findings, mutations in the DNA binding
   domain of p53 and promoter methylation of miR-125b were investigated.
   Four out of nine patients with induced SIRT7 carried mutations in the
   p53 gene and one patient showed hypermethylation of the miR-125b
   promoter region. Conclusion: Our findings suggest the oncogenic
   potential of SIRT7 in hepatocarcinogenesis. A regulatory loop is
   proposed whereby SIRT7 inhibits transcriptional activation of
   p21WAF1/Cip1 by way of repression of miR-125a-5p and miR-125b. This
   makes SIRT7 a promising target in cancer therapy. (HEPATOLOGY 2013)

TI Thyroid Cancer in Pediatric Age Group: An Institutional Experience and
   Review of the Literature
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY
AB Very few have been reported on children with differentiated thyroid
   cancer (DTC), although 15% of them are diagnosed below 20 years of age.
   Children with DTC present with more advanced disease; however, they have
   a more favorable outcome. In this paper, we aimed to present the data in
   our institution on pediatric DTC patients, making an emphasis on the
   risk factors of metastasis and recurrence, as well as to the outcome of
   treatment. Clinical data of 50 pediatric patients referred to our
   institution for radioiodine treatment (RAI) between 1976 and 2010 were
   obtained. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histopathologic
   diagnosis (36 patients) followed by papillary carcinoma with follicular
   variant (10 patients). Multifocality was reported in 66% of the
   pathology reports. At the time of diagnosis 35 patients had regional
   lymph node metastasis, 18 had local invasion, and 11 had distant
   metastasis. No distant metastasis was present in patients with unifocal
   disease (P=0.018). The mean duration of follow-up was 77.6+/-62.7
   months. Patients with local disease had longer disease-free survival
   than patients with distant metastasis (P=0.033). Despite the small
   number of patients, the follow-up was relatively long and the presented
   results confirmed overall good prognosis in children with DTC.

TI TFIIIC bound DNA elements in nuclear organization and insulation
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB tRNA genes (tDNAs) have been known to have barrier insulator function in
   budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for over a decade. tDNAs also
   play a role in genome organization by clustering at sites in the nucleus
   and both of these functions are dependent on the transcription factor
   TFIIIC. More recently TFIIIC bound sites devoid of pol III, termed
   Extra-TFIIIC sites (ETC) have been identified in budding yeast and these
   sites also function as insulators and affect genome organization.
   Subsequent studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that TFIIIC bound
   sites were insulators and also fimctioned as Chromosome Organization
   Clamps (COC); tethering the sites to the nuclear periphery. Very
   recently studies have moved to mammalian systems where pol III genes and
   their associated factors have been investigated in both mouse and human
   cells. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) that bind TFIIIC,
   function as insulator elements and tDNAs can also function as both
   enhancer - blocking and barrier insulators in these organisms. It was
   also recently shown that tDNAs cluster with other tDNAs and with ETCs
   but not with pol II transcribed genes. Intriguingly, TFIIIC is often
   found near pol II transcription start sites and it remains unclear what
   the consequences of TFIIIC based genomic organization are and what
   influence pol III factors have on pol II transcribed genes and vice
   versa. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the known
   data on pol III factors in insulation and genome organization and
   identify the many open questions that require further investigation.

TI Robotic Thyroidectomy and Neck Dissection Past, Present, and Future
SO CANCER JOURNAL
AB The advantages of endoscopic thyroidectomy and neck dissection include
   reduced hyperesthesia or paresthesia in the neck and favorable cosmetic
   outcomes. However, endoscopic thyroidectomy with neck dissection has a
   long learning curve, as well as technical limitations associated with a
   2-dimensional view and a reduced dexterity of movement, particularly
   when operating in deep and narrow spaces such as the neck area. A
   robotic approach has been developed to overcome these limitations,
   facilitating manipulation and shortening the learning curve. This system
   enables the surgeon to control the 3-dimensional high-definition camera,
   reducing physiological tremors and enabling free dexterity of movement
   using articulated instruments. Therefore, robotic surgery has been found
   to eliminate many problems encountered with conventional endoscopic
   techniques.
   Recently, robotic thyroidectomy with neck dissection via a gasless
   transaxillary approach was shown to yield similar oncologic outcomes as
   conventional open procedures, as determined by postoperative
   (131)radioactive iodine scans, serum thyroglobulin concentrations, and
   number of retrieved cervical lymph nodes. We also found that the robotic
   technique was safe and feasible in thyroid cancer patients, yielding
   excellent cosmetic results, reduced pain, improved sensory changes and
   decreased postoperative voice changes and swallowing discomfort. For
   surgeons, the use of a robot offers a shorter operation time and the
   need for a shorter learning curve than conventional endoscopic
   thyroidectomy. Robotic thyroidectomy also causes less musculoskeletal
   discomfort to surgeons than open or endoscopic thyroidectomy. The
   advantages of robotic surgery over open or endoscopic surgery suggest
   that robotic thyroidectomy with neck dissection may become the preferred
   surgical option for patients with thyroid cancer. Further analyses of
   surgeons' experience, assessments of long-term outcomes, and randomized
   controlled trials remain important.

TI Regulation of DU145 prostate cancer cell growth by Scm-like with four
   mbt domains 2
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES
AB Mammalian SFMBTs have been considered to be polycomb group repressors.
   However, molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian SFMBTs-mediated gene
   regulation and their biological function have not been characterized. In
   the present study, we identified YY1 and methylated histones as
   interacting proteins of human SFMBT2. We also found that human SFMBT2
   binds preferentially to methylated histone H3 and H4 that are associated
   with transcriptional repression. Using DU145 prostate cancer cells as a
   model, we showed that SFMBT2 has a transcriptional repression activity
   on HOXB13 gene expression. In addition, occupancy of SFMBT2 coincided
   with enrichment of di- and tri-methylated H3K9 and H4K20 as well as
   tri-methylated H3K27 at the HOXB13 gene promoter. When SFMBT2 was
   depleted by siRNA in DU145 prostate cancer cells, significant
   up-regulation of HOXB13 gene expression and decreased cell growth were
   observed. Collectively, our findings indicate that human SFMBT2 may
   regulate cell growth via epigenetic regulation of HOXB13 gene expression
   in DU145 prostate cancer cells.

TI Examining post-translational modification-mediated protein-protein
   interactions using a chemical proteomics approach
SO PROTEIN SCIENCE
AB Post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins can control complex
   and dynamic cellular processes via regulating interactions between key
   proteins. To understand these regulatory mechanisms, it is critical that
   we can profile the PTM-dependent proteinprotein interactions. However,
   identifying these interactions can be very difficult using available
   approaches, as PTMs can be dynamic and often mediate relatively weak
   proteinprotein interactions. We have recently developed CLASPI
   (cross-linking-assisted and stable isotope labeling in cell
   culture-based protein identification), a chemical proteomics approach to
   examine proteinprotein interactions mediated by methylation in human
   cell lysates. Here, we report three extensions of the CLASPI approach.
   First, we show that CLASPI can be used to analyze methylation-dependent
   proteinprotein interactions in lysates of fission yeast, a genetically
   tractable model organism. For these studies, we examined trimethylated
   histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9Me3)-dependent proteinprotein interactions.
   Second, we demonstrate that CLASPI can be used to examine
   phosphorylation-dependent proteinprotein interactions. In particular, we
   profile proteins recognizing phosphorylated histone H3 threonine-3
   (H3T3-Phos), a mitotic histone mark appearing exclusively during cell
   division. Our approach identified survivin, the only known
   H3T3-Phos-binding protein, as well as other proteins, such as MCAK and
   KIF2A, that are likely to be involved in weak but selective interactions
   with this histone phosphorylation mark. Finally, we demonstrate that the
   CLASPI approach can be used to study the interplay between histone
   H3T3-Phos and trimethylation on the adjacent residue lysine 4 (H3K4Me3).
   Together, our findings indicate the CLASPI approach can be broadly
   applied to profile proteinprotein interactions mediated by PTMs.

TI Stem Cells and Cancer Stem-Like Cells in Endocrine Tissues
SO ENDOCRINE PATHOLOGY
AB Cancer stem-like cells are a subpopulation of self-renewing cells that
   are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy than the other
   surrounding cancer cells. The cancer stem cell model predicts that only
   a subset of cancer cells possess the ability to self-renew and produce
   progenitor cells that can reconstitute and sustain tumor growth.
   Evidence supporting the existence of cancer stem-like cells in the
   thyroid, pituitary, and in other endocrine tissues is rapidly
   accumulating. These cells have been studied using specific biomarkers
   including: CD133, CD44, Nestin, Nanog, and aldehyde dehydrogenase
   enzyme. Putative cancer stem-like cells can be studied in vitro using
   serum-free media supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor and
   epidermal growth factor grown in low attachment plates or in
   extracellular matrix leading to sphere formation in vitro. Cancer
   stem-like cells can also be separated by fluorescent cell sorting and
   used for in vitro or in vivo studies. Injection of enriched populations
   of cancer stem-like cells (also referred to as tumor initiating cells)
   into immunodeficient mice results in growth of xenografts which express
   cancer stem-like biomarkers. Human cancer stem-like cells have been
   identified in thyroid cancer cell lines, in primary thyroid cancers, in
   normal pituitary, and in pituitary tumors. Other recent studies suggest
   the existence of stem cells and cancer stem-like cells in endocrine
   tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, lungs, adrenal,
   parathyroid, and skin. New discoveries in this field may lead to more
   effective therapies for highly aggressive and lethal endocrine cancers.

TI Genome-wide Determinants of Proviral Targeting, Clonal Abundance and
   Expression in Natural HTLV-1 Infection
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The regulation of proviral latency is a central problem in
   retrovirology. We postulate that the genomic integration site of human T
   lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) determines the pattern of expression
   of the provirus, which in turn determines the abundance and pathogenic
   potential of infected T cell clones in vivo. We recently developed a
   high-throughput method for the genome-wide amplification, identification
   and quantification of proviral integration sites. Here, we used this
   protocol to test two hypotheses. First, that binding sites for
   transcription factors and chromatin remodelling factors in the genome
   flanking the proviral integration site of HTLV-1 are associated with
   integration targeting, spontaneous proviral expression, and in vivo
   clonal abundance. Second, that the transcriptional orientation of the
   HTLV-1 provirus relative to that of the nearest host gene determines
   spontaneous proviral expression and in vivo clonal abundance.
   Integration targeting was strongly associated with the presence of a
   binding site for specific host transcription factors, especially STAT1
   and p53. The presence of the chromatin remodelling factors BRG1 and INI1
   and certain host transcription factors either upstream or downstream of
   the provirus was associated respectively with silencing or spontaneous
   expression of the provirus. Cells expressing HTLV-1 Tax protein were
   significantly more frequent in clones of low abundance in vivo. We
   conclude that transcriptional interference and chromatin remodelling are
   critical determinants of proviral latency in natural HTLV-1 infection.

TI New insights into human pre-implantation metabolism in vivo and in vitro
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB The metabolism of pre-implantation embryos is far from being understood.
   In human embryos, the two major obstacles are the scarcity of material,
   for obvious ethical reasons, and complete absence of a relevant in vivo
   control model. Over-extrapolation from animal species to human systems
   adds to the complexity of the problem. Removal of some metabolites from
   media has been proposed, such as glucose and essential amino acids, on
   the basis of their pseudo "toxicity". In contrast, addition of some
   compounds such as growth factors has been proposed in order to decrease
   apoptosis, which is a natural physiologic process. These suggestions
   reflect the absence of global knowledge, and in consequence mask
   reality. Some aspects of metabolism have been ignored, such as lipid
   metabolism. Others are seriously underestimated, such as oxidative
   stress and its relationship to imprinting/methylation, of paramount
   importance for genetic regulation and chromosomal stability. It has
   become increasingly obvious that more studies are essential, especially
   in view of the major extension of ART activities worldwide.

TI Structure and function of long noncoding RNAs in epigenetic regulation
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Genomes of complex organisms encode an abundance and diversity of long
   noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) that are expressed throughout the cell and
   fulfill a wide variety of regulatory roles at almost every stage of gene
   expression. These roles, which encompass sensory, guiding, scaffolding
   and allosteric capacities, derive from folded modular domains in
   IncRNAs. In this diverse functional repertoire, we focus on the
   well-characterized ability for IncRNAs to function as epigenetic
   modulators. Many IncRNAs bind to chromatin-modifying proteins and
   recruit their catalytic activity to specific sites in the genome,
   thereby modulating chromatin states and impacting gene expression.
   Considering this regulatory potential in combination with the abundance
   of IncRNAs suggests that IncRNAs may be part of a broad epigenetic
   regulatory network.

TI Differences in Urinary Arsenic Metabolites between Diabetic and
   Non-Diabetic Subjects in Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Ingestion of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is considered to be related to the
   development of diabetes mellitus. In order to clarify the possible
   differences in the metabolism in diabetics, we measured urinary iAs
   metabolites in diabetic cases and non-diabetic control subjects in
   Faridpur, an arsenic-contaminated area in Bangladesh.
   Physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetic cases (140 persons) and non-diabetic
   controls (180 persons) were recruited. Drinking water and spot urine
   samples were collected. Mean concentrations of total arsenic in drinking
   water did not differ between cases (85.1 mu g/L) and controls (85.8 mu
   g/L). The percentage of urinary iAs (iAs%) was significantly lower in
   cases (8.6%) than in controls (10.4%), while that of dimethylarsinic
   acid (DMA%) was higher in cases (82.6%) than in controls (79.9%). This
   may have been due to the higher secondary methylation index (SMI) in the
   former (11.6) rather than the latter (10.0). Adjusting for matching
   factors (sex and unions), and the additional other covariates (age and
   water arsenic) significantly attenuated the differences in iAs%, SMI,
   and DMA%, respectively, though the difference in monomethylarsonic acid%
   was newly significant in the latter adjustment. Our study did not
   suggest any significant differences in urinary arsenic metabolites
   between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.

TI DNA Topoisomerase III Localizes to Centromeres and Affects Centromeric
   CENP-A Levels in Fission Yeast
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Centromeres are specialized chromatin regions marked by the presence of
   nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant
   CENP-A, which is essential for chromosome segregation. Assembly and
   disassembly of nucleosomes is intimately linked to DNA topology, and DNA
   topoisomerases have previously been implicated in the dynamics of
   canonical H3 nucleosomes. Here we show that Schizosaccharomyces pombe
   Top3 and its partner Rqh1 are involved in controlling the levels of
   CENP-A(Cnp1) at centromeres. Both top3 and rqh1 mutants display defects
   in chromosome segregation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and
   tiling microarrays, we show that Top3, unlike Top1 and Top2, is highly
   enriched at centromeric central domains, demonstrating that Top3 is the
   major topoisomerase in this region. Moreover, centromeric Top3 occupancy
   positively correlates with CENP-A(Cnp1) occupancy. Intriguingly, both
   top3 and rqh1 mutants display increased relative enrichment of
   CENP-A(Cnp1) at centromeric central domains. Thus, Top3 and Rqh1
   normally limit the levels of CENP-A(Cnp1) in this region. This new role
   is independent of the established function of Top3 and Rqh1 in
   homologous recombination downstream of Rad51. Therefore, we hypothesize
   that the Top3-Rqh1 complex has an important role in controlling
   centromere DNA topology, which in turn affects the dynamics of
   CENP-A(Cnp1) nucleosomes.

TI H2A.Z and H2B.Z double-variant nucleosomes define intergenic regions and
   dynamically occupy var gene promoters in the malaria parasite Plasmodium
   falciparum
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB Histone variants are important components of eukaryotic chromatin and
   can alter chromatin structure to confer specialized functions. H2B
   variant histones are rare in nature but have evolved independently in
   the phyla Apicomplexa and Trypanasomatida. Here, we investigate the
   apicomplexan-specific Plasmodium falciparum histone variant Pf H2B.Z and
   show that within nucleosomes Pf H2B.Z dimerizes with the H2A variant Pf
   H2A.Z and that Pf H2B.Z and Pf H2A.Z occupancy correlates in the subset
   of genes examined. These double-variant nucleosomes also carry common
   markers of euchromatin like H3K4me3 and histone acetylation. Pf H2B.Z
   levels are elevated in intergenic regions across the genome, except in
   the var multigene family, where Pf H2A.Z/Pf H2B.Z double-variant
   nucleosomes are only enriched in the promoter of the single active var
   copy and this enrichment is developmentally regulated. Importantly, this
   pattern seems to be specific for var genes and does not apply to other
   heterochromatic gene families involved in red blood cell invasion which
   are also subject to clonal expression. Thus, Pf H2A.Z/Pf H2B.Z
   double-variant nucleosomes appear to have a highly specific function in
   the regulation of P.falciparum virulence.

TI Post-training glucocorticoid receptor activation during Pavlovian
   conditioning reduces Pavlovian-instrumental transfer in rats
SO PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR
AB Considerable evidence suggests that glucocorticoid receptor activation
   can enhance memory consolidation in Pavlovian learning tasks. For
   instance, post-training injections of the synthetic glucocorticoid
   receptor agonist dexamethasone increased conditioned responding to
   reward-predictive Pavlovian stimuli. Here we explored whether
   post-training dexamethasone injections can enhance appetitive Pavlovian
   learning and amplify the ability of Pavlovian stimuli to invigorate
   instrumental behaviour, a phenomenon termed Pavlovian-instrumental
   transfer (PIT). Animals were given 8 training days with two sessions per
   day, an instrumental training session in the morning and a Pavlovian
   training session in the afternoon. Dexamethasone or vehicle injections
   were administered daily immediately after Pavlovian training sessions.
   In a subsequent transfer test, we measured the general PIT effect, i.e.
   the enhancement of lever pressing for expected reward during
   presentation of an appetitive Pavlovian stimulus predictive for the same
   reward. Repeated high-dose (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) dexamethasone injections
   elicited pronounced body weight loss, markedly reduced instrumental
   performance and left Pavlovian learning unaltered, whereas repeated
   low-dose (3 mu g/kg, i.p.) dexamethasone injections inhibited body
   weight gain, slightly reduced instrumental performance and left
   Pavlovian learning unaltered during training. Importantly, in rats
   subjected to high- and low-dose dexamethasone injections, the overall
   response rates and the PIT effect were reduced in the transfer test.
   Thus, dexamethasone given after Pavlovian training was not able to
   amplify the invigorating effects of Pavlovian stimuli on instrumental
   action. Considerable evidence suggests that body weight changes after
   repeated low- and high-dose dexamethasone treatment as observed here are
   associated with muscle atrophy that could impair response capabilities.
   However, our data suggest that impaired response capabilities are not a
   major factor accounting for reduced PIT in dexamethasone-treated
   animals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Follicular neoplasm involving one lobe of thyroid: is hemithyroidectomy
   the adequate initial procedure?
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), intraoperative
   frozen section, elastography and molecular markers have been tried to
   predict malignancy in indeterminate thyroid lesions. However, only
   histopathological evidence of capsular and vascular invasion can confirm
   malignancy. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of
   hemithyroidectomy (HT) as an adequate surgical intervention in patients
   having cytologically proven follicular neoplasm limited to one lobe of
   the thyroid in a resource-limited country like India.
   A retrospective study was conducted. The data of all patients operated
   for FNAC-proven follicular neoplasm (2008-2011) were analysed.
   A total of 123 cases had FNAC-proven follicular neoplasm. Fourteen were
   male and 109 female. Forty-six patients with multiple nodules involving
   both lobes (MNG) underwent total thyroidectomy (TT), whereas 77 who had
   solitary thyroid nodule (STN) underwent HT. Among patients who had HT (n
   = 77), histopathology revealed malignancy in 3.6 % (n = 3). Patients who
   needed completion thyroidectomy (CT) were older females (p = 0.02) with
   higher TSH levels (p = 0.0001), shorter duration of goitre (p = 0.01)
   and smaller nodules (p = 0.04).
   Hemithyroidectomy is an adequate initial surgical procedure for
   FNAC-proven follicular neoplasm. The incidence of carcinoma is 3.9 %.
   Older subjects with high normal TSH are likely to have malignancy.
   Routine employment of intraoperative frozen section, elastography and
   molecular markers is not necessary if locally unavailable, since the
   incidence of malignancy in FNAC-proven follicular neoplasm is low.

TI Dietary Iodine and Selenium Affected the mRNA Expression Levels of Skin
   Monodeiodinase (II, III) in Liaoning Cashmere Goats
SO BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH
AB Livestock are frequently provided nutrient-depleted diets, which can
   negatively impact animal health and productivity. In our previous trial,
   we found that iodine (I) supplementation (not selenium (Se)) could
   increase cashmere production. In order to explore the role of I and Se
   in cashmere growth, we investigated the effects of dietary I and Se
   supplementation in Liaoning cashmere goats. Serum thyroid hormone status
   and the mRNA expression levels of skin monodeiodinase (MDII, MDIII) were
   measured during the cashmere fiber growth period. Forty-eight
   2.5-year-old Liaoning cashmere goats (38.6 +/- 2.65 kg BW) were divided
   into six equal groups, and their diets were supplemented with I (0, 2,
   or 4 mg/kg DM) and Se (0 or 1 mg/kg DM) in a 2 x 3 factorial treatment
   design. The six treatment groups were: I(0)Se(0), I(2)Se(0), I(4)Se(0),
   I(0)Se(1), I(2)Se(1), and I(4)Se(1). Concentrations of I and Se in the
   basal diet (group I(0)Se(0)) were 0.67 and 0.09 mg/kg DM, respectively.
   The trial started in September of 2009 and lasted 70 days. For every
   measured parameter, supplemental Se had no significant effect on thyroid
   hormones, but improved the mRNA expression levels of skin MDIII (P <
   0.01). However, supplemental I increased levels of thyroid hormones
   (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) and improved the mRNA expression levels
   of skin MDII (P < 0.05). These results show that the addition of I to
   cashmere goat feedstock may be an effective means of increasing cashmere
   production through thyroid hormones regulating the mRNA expression of
   skin MDII.

TI Site-Specific PEGylation of Human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone to Prolong
   Duration of Action
SO BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
AB Recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH or Thyrogen) has
   been approved for thyroid cancer diagnostics and treatment under a
   multidose regimen due to its short circulating half-life. To reduce
   dosing frequency, PEGylation strategies were explored to increase the
   duration of action of rhTSH. Lysine and N-terminal PEGylation resulted
   in heterogeneous product profiles with 40% or lower reaction yields of
   monoPEGylated products. Eleven cysteine mutants were designed based on a
   structure model of the TSH-TSH receptor (TSHR) complex to create unique
   conjugation sites on both alpha and beta subunits for site-specific
   conjugation. Sequential screening of mutant expression level,
   oligomerization tendency, and conjugation efficiency resulted in the
   identification of the alpha G22C rhTSH mutant for stable expression and
   scale-up PEGylation. The introduced cysteine in the alpha G22C rhTSH
   mutant was partially blocked when isolated from conditioned media and
   could only be effectively PEGylated after mild reduction with cysteine.
   This produced a higher reaction yield, similar to 85%, for the
   monoPEGylated product. Although the mutation had no effect on receptor
   binding, PEGylation of alpha G22C rhTSH led to a PEG size-dependent
   decrease in receptor binding. Nevertheless, the 40 kDa PEG alpha G22C
   rhTSH showed a prolonged duration of action compared to rhTSH in a rat
   pharmacodynamics model. Reverse-phase HPLC and N-terminal sequencing
   experiments confirmed site-specific modification at the engineered Cys
   22 position on the alpha-subunit. This work is another demonstration of
   successful PEGylation of a cysteine-knot protein by an engineered
   cysteine mutation.

TI Genetic Variation Throughout the Folate Metabolic Pathway Influences
   Negative Symptom Severity in Schizophrenia
SO SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB Low serum folate levels previously have been associated with negative
   symptom risk in schizophrenia, as has the hypofunctional 677C>T variant
   of the MTHFR gene. This study examined whether other missense
   polymorphisms in folate-regulating enzymes, in concert with MTHFR,
   influence negative symptoms in schizophrenia, and whether total risk
   allele load interacts with serum folate status to further stratify
   negative symptom risk. Medicated outpatients with schizophrenia (n =
   219), all of European origin and some included in a previous report,
   were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A subset of 82
   patients also underwent nonfasting serum folate testing. Patients were
   genotyped for the MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133), MTHFR 1298A>C (rs1801131),
   MTR 2756A>G (rs1805087), MTRR 203A>G (rs1801394), FOLH1 484T>C
   (rs202676), RFC 80A>G (rs1051266), and COMT 675G>A (rs4680)
   polymorphisms. All genotypes were entered into a linear regression model
   to determine significant predictors of negative symptoms, and risk
   scores were calculated based on total risk allele dose. Four variants,
   MTHFR 677T, MTR 2756A, FOLH1 484C, and COMT 675A, emerged as significant
   independent predictors of negative symptom severity, accounting for
   significantly greater variance in negative symptoms than MTHFR 677C>T
   alone. Total allele dose across the 4 variants predicted negative
   symptom severity only among patients with low folate levels. These
   findings indicate that multiple genetic variants within the folate
   metabolic pathway contribute to negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A
   relationship between folate level and negative symptom severity among
   patients with greater genetic vulnerability is biologically plausible
   and suggests the utility of folate supplementation in these patients.

TI Folate, Homocysteine and the Cardiac Neural Crest
SO DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS
AB Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common congenital defects
   worldwide, and perigestational folate supplementation (PFS) is the most
   effective large-scale intervention to date for reducing CHD. This review
   is based upon the following premises: that the majority of CHD result
   from disruption of development of the cardiac neural crest (CNC); and
   that the CNC is highly responsive to folate and homocysteine. The
   following roles of folate are discussed in relation to CNC development:
   one-carbon metabolism in support of mitosis and gene methylation; and
   gene regulation via direct activity of the folate receptor. The
   following roles of hyperhomocysteinemia are discussed in the same
   context: increased oxidative stress; disruption of gene methylation;
   homocysteinylation of key proteins; and NMDA receptor binding. It is
   proposed that well-focused advances in folate-CNC research could lead to
   development of strategies, in addition to PFS, to facilitate normal CNC
   and heart development, and thereby further reduce CHD. Developmental

TI Alterations in local thyroid hormone signaling in the hippocampus of the
   SAMP8 mouse at younger ages: Association with delayed myelination and
   behavioral abnormalities
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) strains were established through
   selective inbreeding of the AKR/J strain based on phenotypic variations
   of aging and consist of senescence-prone (SAMP) and senescence-resistant
   (SAMR) strains. Among them, SAMP8 is considered as a model of
   neurodegeneration displaying age-associated learning and memory
   impairment and altered emotional status. Because adult hypothyroidism is
   one of the common causes of cognitive impairment and various psychiatric
   disorders, we examined the possible involvement of thyroid hormone (TH)
   signaling in the pathological aging of SAMP8 using the
   senescence-resistant SAMR1 as control. Although plasma TH levels were
   similar in both strains, a significant decrease in type 2 deiodinase
   (D2) gene expression was observed in the SAMP8 hippocampus from 1 to 8
   months of age, which led to a 3550% reductions at the protein level and
   20% reduction of its enzyme activity at 1, 3, and 5 months. D2 is
   responsible for local conversion of thyroxine into transcriptionally
   active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), so the results suggest a reduction
   in T3 level in the SAMP8 hippocampus. Attenuation of local TH signaling
   was confirmed by downregulation of TH-dependent genes and by
   immunohistochemical demonstration of delayed and reduced accumulation of
   myelin basic protein, the expression of which is highly dependent on TH.
   Furthermore, we found that hyperactivity and reduced anxiety were not
   age-associated but were characteristic of young SAMP8 before they start
   showing impairments in learning and memory. Early alterations in local
   TH signaling may thus underlie behavioral abnormalities as well as the
   pathological aging of SAMP8. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Recognition of Methylated Peptides by Drosophila melanogaster Polycomb
   Chromodomain
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Lysine methylation is one of the important post-translational
   modifications (PTMs) that regulate protein functions Up to now,
   proteomic identification of this PTM remains a challenge due to the lack
   of effective enrichment methods in mass spectrometry experiments To
   address this challenge, we present here a systematic approach to
   predicting peptides in which lysine residues may be methylated to
   mediate protein protein interactions. We used the chromodomai of the
   polycomb protein in Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to
   illustrate the success of this approach. We started with molecular
   dynamics simulations and free energy analyses on the histone peptides
   complexed with the polycomb chromodomain to understand how the binding
   specificity is achieved. We next conducted virtual mutagenesis to
   quantify each domain and peptide residue's contribution to the
   domain-peptide recognition, based on which scoring scheme was developed
   to evaluate the possibility of any lysine-containing peptides to be
   methylated and recognized by the chromodomain. A peptide microarray
   experiment on a panel of conserved histone peptides showed a
   satisfactory prediction accuracy of the scoring scheme. Next, we
   implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that integrates multiple lines of
   evidence including conservation, subcellular localization, and mass
   spectrometry data to scan the fly proteome for a systematic
   identification of possible methyllysine-containing peptides. These
   putative chromodomain-binding peptides suggest unknown functions of the
   important regulator protein polycomb and provide a list of candidate
   methylation events for follow-up investigations.

TI Cutting Edge: An Inactive Chromatin Configuration at the IL-10 Locus in
   Human Neutrophils
SO JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB To identify the molecular basis of IL-10 expression in human phagocytes,
   we evaluated the chromatin modification status at their IL-10 genomic
   locus. We analyzed posttranslational modifications of histones
   associated with genes that are active, repressed, or poised for
   transcriptional activation, including H3K4me3, H4Ac, H3K27Ac, and
   H3K4me1 marks. Differently from autologous IL-10-producing monocytes,
   none of the marks under evaluation was detected at the IL-10 locus of
   resting or activated neutrophils from healthy subjects or melanoma
   patients. By contrast, increased H3K4me3, H4Ac, H3K4me1, and H3K27Ac
   levels were detected at syntenic regions of the IL-10 locus in mouse
   neutrophils. Altogether, data demonstrate that human neutrophils,
   differently from either monocytes or mouse neutrophils, cannot switch on
   the IL-10 gene because its locus is in an inactive state, likely
   reflecting a neutrophil-specific developmental outcome. Implicitly, data
   also definitively settle a currently unsolved issue on the capacity of
   human neutrophils to produce IL-10. The Journal of Immunology, 2013,

TI Lysyl 5-Hydroxylation, a Novel Histone Modification, by Jumonji Domain
   Containing 6 (JMJD6)
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB JMJD6 is reported to hydroxylate lysyl residues of a splicing factor,
   U2AF65. In this study, we found that JMJD6 hydroxylates histone lysyl
   residues. In vitro experiments showed that JMJD6 has a binding affinity
   to histone proteins and hydroxylates multiple lysyl residues of histone
   H3 and H4 tails. Using JMJD6 knock-out mouse embryos, we revealed that
   JMJD6 hydroxylates lysyl residues of histones H2A/H2B and H3/H4 in vivo
   by amino acid composition analysis. 5-Hydroxylysine was detected at the
   highest level in histones purified from murine testis, which expressed
   JMJD6 at a significantly high level among various tissues examined, and
   JMJD6 overexpression increased the amount of 5-hydroxylysine in histones
   in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results indicate that
   histones are additional substrates of JMJD6 in vivo. Because
   5-hydroxylation of lysyl residues inhibited N-acetylation and
   N-methylation by an acetyltransferase and a methyltransferase,
   respectively, in vitro, histone 5-hydroxylation may have important roles
   in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription or chromosomal
   rearrangement.

TI Physiological roles of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY OF LIPIDS
AB Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the
   methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine (PC).
   This 22.3 kDa protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and
   mitochondria associated membranes of liver. The supply of the substrates
   AdoMet and phosphatidylethanolamine, and the product AdoHcy, can
   regulate the activity of PEMT. Estrogen has been identified as a
   positive activator, and Sp1 as a negative regulator, of transcription of
   the PEMT gene. Targeted inactivation of the PEMT gene produced mice that
   had a mild phenotype when fed a chow diet However, when Pemt(-/-) mice
   were fed a choline-deficient diet steatohepatitis and liver failure
   developed after 3 days. The steatohepatitis was due to a decreased ratio
   of PC to phosphatidylethanolamine that caused leakage from the plasma
   membrane of hepatocytes. Pemt(-/-) mice exhibited attenuated secretion
   of very low-density lipoproteins and homocysteine. Pemt(-/-) mice bred
   with mice that lacked the low-density lipoprotein receptor, or
   apolipoprotein E were protected from high fat/high cholesterol-induced
   atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, Pemt(-/-) mice were protected from high
   fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance compared to wildtype
   mice. If the diet were supplemented with additional choline, the
   protection against obesity/insulin resistance in Pemt(-/-) mice was
   eliminated. Humans with a Val-to-Met substitution in PEMT at residue 175
   may have increased susceptibility to nonalcoholic liver disease. This

TI Metabolic Modulation of Epigenetics in Gliomas
SO BRAIN PATHOLOGY
AB Cancer metabolism and epigenetics are two relatively new areas of cancer
   research. Recent years have seen an explosion of studies implicating
   either altered tumor metabolism or epigenetic mechanisms in the
   pathogenesis or maintenance of brain tumors. A new paradigm is emerging
   in cancer biology that represents a convergence of these themes, the
   metabolic regulation of epigenetics. We discuss this interrelationship
   in the context of two metabolic enzymes that can influence the
   pathogenesis of gliomas by altering the epigenetic state. The first of
   these enzymes is isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which is mutated in
   secondary glioblastomas and approximate to 70% of grade II/III
   astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Mutant IDH1 results in the
   production of a metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that can inhibit
   DNA and histone demethylating enzymes resulting in the glioma-CpG island
   phenotype (G-CIMP) and increased histone methylation marks. Pyruvate
   kinase M2 (PKM2), an enzyme that plays a critical role in the glycolytic
   pathway, is a second example of a metabolic enzyme that can affect
   histone modifications. In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven
   glioblastoma, PKM2 translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates
   histone 3 at threonine 11 (H3-T11). This causes dissociation of HDAC3
   from the CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and c-MYC promoters and subsequent histone
   acetylation, leading to transcription of Cyclin-D1 and c-MYC, and
   subsequent cell proliferation. Modification of the epigenetic state by
   alterations in metabolic enzymes is a novel phenomenon that contributes
   to the pathogenesis of gliomas and may help in the identification of new
   therapeutic targets.

TI Are imprinting disorders more prevalent after human in vitro
   fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection?
SO FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB Objective: To review the literature and present original data to answer
   the question of whether in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic
   sperm injection (ICSI) is associated with an increase in imprinted
   diseases in offspring. If the answer is positive, to investigate whether
   there is a causal relationship between IVF or ICSI and the imprinted
   diseases.
   Design: Review study.
   Result(s): Eight epidemiologic studies were suitable to calculate the
   weighted relative risk for the birth of a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann
   syndrome following IVF or ICSI compared with the risk in the normal
   population. This relative risk was 5.2 (95% CI 1.6-7.4). In one study
   the relative risk was corrected for parents' fertility problems and no
   significant association was found. Data on the Silver-Russell syndrome
   are too sparse to draw conclusions, but a positive association with IVF
   or ICSI treatment is probable. No significant associations were found
   between the incidences of the Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes and
   IVF or ICSI treatments. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman
   syndrome are more likely to be born to parents with fertility problems.
   All retinoblastomas in children born after IVF or ICSI could be
   explained by de novo mutations in the RB1 gene and were not associated
   with imprinted genes. Imprinted diseases result from methylation errors
   already present in sperms or oocytes. There is no proof of a causal
   relationship between imprinted diseases and IVF or ICSI treatments.
   Conclusion(s): Imprinting disorders are more prevalent after human IVF
   or ICSI. Future studies should correct for fertility problems in the
   affected and comparison groups. It is highly improbable that assisted
   reproduction technologies cause imprinted diseases in humans. (Fertil

TI Genetics and epigenetics of rheumatoid arthritis
SO NATURE REVIEWS RHEUMATOLOGY
AB Investigators have made key advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
   genetics in the past 10 years. Although genetic studies have had limited
   influence on clinical practice and drug discovery, they are currently
   generating testable hypotheses to explain disease pathogenesis. Firstly,
   we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic
   susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC. Understanding
   how genetic variants translate into pathogenic mechanisms and ultimately
   into phenotypes remains a mystery for most of the polymorphisms that
   confer susceptibility to RA, but functional data are emerging. Interplay
   between environmental and genetic factors is poorly understood and in
   need of further investigation. Secondly, we review current knowledge of
   the role of epigenetics in RA susceptibility. Differences in the
   epigenome could represent one of the ways in which environmental
   exposures translate into phenotypic outcomes. The best understood
   epigenetic phenomena include post-translational histone modifications
   and DNA methylation events, both of which have critical roles in gene
   regulation. Epigenetic studies in RA represent a new area of research
   with the potential to answer unsolved questions. Viatte, S. etal. Nat.

TI Identification of a Novel Metalloproteinase and Its Role in Juvenile
   Development of the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta (Linnaeus)
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL
   EVOLUTION
AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of zinc-dependent
   endopeptidases that are highly conserved across numerous taxa, from
   bacteria to humans. Recently, MMPs have been identified in several
   insect species and are hypothesized to function in immunity and
   development. In this study, we identify a putative MMP and correlate its
   proteolytic activity and gene and protein expression in the tracheae
   with developmental stage. Ms-MMP gene expression increases 10-fold
   during molting, which is accompanied by an increase in both protein
   expression and gelatinolytic activity. To directly test the hypothesis
   that Ms-MMP plays a critical role in juvenile development of Manduca
   sexta, we injected a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor and recorded its
   effects on growth and development. Inhibition of MMPs caused a delay in
   juvenile development and decreased growth rates. Understanding the
   function of MMPs will help us better understand molting and control of
   body size in insects. Furthermore, elucidating functions for MMPs in
   lower taxa may yield critical information about the evolution of the
   numerous MMPs found in vertebrates. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.)

TI LC2 and OsVIL2 Promote Rice Flowering by Photoperoid-Induced Epigenetic
   Silencing of OsLF
SO MOLECULAR PLANT
AB Proper flowering time is essential for plant reproduction. Winter annual
   Arabidopsis thaliana needs vernalization before flowering, during which
   AtVILs (VIN3 and VRN5, components of PRC2 complex) mediate the H3K27
   tri-methylation at the FLC locus (a floral repressor) to repress the FLC
   expression and hence to induce flowering. However, how VILs (VIL,
   VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE) function in rice is unknown. Here we
   demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible
   components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering. Our results showed
   that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day)
   conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2RNAi lines display delayed
   heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and
   Hd3a. Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral
   repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27
   tri-methylation modification. In addition, OsLF directly regulates the
   Hd1 expression through binding to Hd1 promoter. These results first
   demonstrated that the putative PRC2 in rice is involved in photoperiod
   flowering regulation, which is different from that of Arabidopsis, and
   revealed that LC2 binds the promoter region of target gene, presenting a
   possible mechanism of the recruitment process of PRC2 complex to its
   target genes. The studies provide informative clues on the epigenetic
   control of rice flowering.

   Neurotoxicity and Upregulates Parkinson's Disease-Related Genes in
   Dopaminergic Neurons
SO CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB Aims To investigate effects of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors
   on dopaminergic neurons and its underlied mechanism. Methods The DNMT
   inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was tested in cultured
   dopaminergic cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were assayed with
   5-aza-dC alone. Neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+),
   6-hydroxydopamine or rotenone was also assayed with 5-aza-dC
   pretreatment. And mRNA levels of several key PD-related genes were
   examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, CpG methylation of
   -synuclein promoter was examined by bisulfite sequencing. Results
   5-aza-dC resulted in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in
   dopaminergic neuronal cells. Pretreatment with 5-aza-dC exacerbated
   neurotoxic damage to dopaminergic neurons induced by MPP+,
   6-hydroxydopamine or rotenone. 5-aza-dC also induced transcriptional
   upregulation of the key PD-related genes tyrosine hydroxylase and
   -synuclein. And demethylation of CpG in -synuclein promoter was also
   induced by 5-aza-dC and MPP+. Conclusions This DNMT inhibitor might
   influence pathogenesis of PD. And demethylation induced by DNMT
   inhibitor might contribute to dopaminergic neuron death, by increasing
   vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to neurotoxins and by
   misregulating transcription of key PD-related genes. Our data also
   suggested DNMT inhibitors may cause multiple effects on dopaminergic
   neurons.

TI TC-1 (C8orf4) expression is correlated with differentiation in ovarian
   carcinomas and might distinguish metastatic ovarian from metastatic
   colorectal carcinomas
SO VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
AB Thyroid cancer 1 (TC-1, C8orf4) is involved in the development of many
   cancers. In this study, we investigated the correlation between the
   expression of TC-1 and the clinicopathological characteristics of
   ovarian and colorectal adenocarcinomas. We also explored the possible
   use of TC-1 as a marker to distinguish between metastatic tumors of the
   ovary and colorectum. We used immunohistochemistry to examine the
   expression level of TC-1 in 100 ovarian and 100 colorectal
   adenocarcinomas and 25 metastatic carcinomas with the ovary or
   colorectum as primary site. TC-1 was expressed in all ovarian carcinoma
   samples. The high expression rate of TC-1 was 84 % in ovarian
   carcinomas, which was much higher than that observed in colorectal
   adenocarcinomas (35 %, P < 0.001). High expression of TC-1 significantly
   correlated with poor differentiation of ovarian carcinomas (P = 0.013).
   To explore the value of TC-1 in distinguishing metastatic ovarian
   cancers from colorectal cancers, we found the area under the receiver
   operator characteristic curve of TC-1 to be 0.819 (95 % confidence
   interval, 0.760-0.878; P < 0.001). Furthermore, TC-1 was highly
   expressed in 100 % of nine metastatic ovarian cancers, but only in 31 %
   of 16 metastatic colorectal cancers. The higher expression of TC-1 in
   ovarian compared to colorectal adenocarcinomas suggests its potential
   use as a marker, to distinguish between metastatic ovarian and
   colorectal adenocarcinomas.

TI Dynamics of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine during germ
   cell reprogramming
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB Previous studies have revealed that mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs)
   undergo genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming to reset the epigenome
   for totipotency. However, the precise 5-methylcytosine (5mC) dynamics
   and its relationship with the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
   (5hmC) are not clear. Here we analyzed the dynamics of 5mC and 5hmC
   during PGC reprograming and germ cell development. Unexpectedly, we
   found a specific period (E8.5-9.5) during which both 5mC and 5hmC levels
   are low. Subsequently, 5hmC levels increase reaching its peak at E11.5
   and gradually decrease until E13.5 likely by replication-dependent
   dilution. Interestingly, 5hmC is enriched in chromocenters during this
   period. While this germ cell-specific 5hmC subnuclear localization
   pattern is maintained in female germ cells even in mature oocytes, such
   pattern is gradually lost in male germ cells as mitotic proliferation
   resumes during the neonatal stage. Pericentric 5hmC plays an important
   role in silencing major satellite repeat, especially in female PGCs.
   Global transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq revealed that the great
   majority of differentially expressed genes from E9.5 to 13.5 are
   upregulated in both male and female PGCs. Although only female PGCs
   enter meiosis during the prenatal stage, meiosis-related and a subset of
   imprinted genes are significantly upregulated in both male and female
   PGCs at E13.5. Thus, our study not only reveals the dynamics of 5mC and
   5hmC during PGC reprogramming and germ cell development, but also their
   potential role in epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional
   regulation of meiotic and imprinted genes.

   putative over-represented transcription factor binding sites in
   nucleotide sequences has been, and still is, one of the most challenging

TI Early repeated maternal separation induces alterations of hippocampus
   reelin expression in rats
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES
AB The long-term effects of repeated maternal separation (MS) during early
   postnatal life on reelin expression in the hippocampus of developing
   rats were investigated in the present study. MS was carried out by
   separating Wistar rat pups singly from their mothers for 3 h a day
   during postnatal days (PND) 2-14. Reelin mRNA and protein levels in the
   hippocampus were determined using qRT-PCR and Western blotting, at PND
   22, PND 60 and PND 90. MS resulted in the loss of body weight in the
   developing rats, and reelin mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus
   generally were down-regulated over the developing period, but the reelin
   mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of 90-day-old male rats were
   up-regulated. These findings suggest that the long-term effects of MS on
   the expression levels of hippocampal reelin mRNA and protein depends on
   the age at which the stressed rats' brains were collected; reelin had
   important implications for the maternal-neonate interaction needed for
   normal brain development. In conclusion, repeated MS occurring during
   early postnatal life may cause the alterations of hippocampal reelin
   expression with the increasing age of developing rats.

TI Identification and analysis of the proximal promoters of microRNA genes
   in Arabidopsis
SO GENOMICS
AB Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression at the
   post-transcription level. In plants, a vast majority of MIR genes are
   thought to be transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). However,
   promoter organization is currently unknown for most plant MIR genes.
   This deficiency prevents a comprehensive understanding of miRNA-mediated
   gene networks. In this study, we performed Pol II chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in Arabidopsis using a genome tiling
   microarray. Distinct Pol II binding was found at most MIR loci, which
   allowed prediction of the transcription start sites (TSSs) for 167 MIR
   genes in Arabidopsis that was validated by average free energy
   profiling. By employing 99 position weight matrices (PWM), we
   systematically scanned the regulatory regions upstream of the TSSs. We
   discovered eleven and ten cis-elements that are statistically over- and
   under-represented in MIR promoters, respectively. Thus, analysis of Pol
   II binding provides a new perspective for studying miRNAs in plants. (C)

SO ONCOGENE
AB Chromatin remodeling factors are becoming known as crucial facilitators
   of recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Multiple
   chromatin remodeling protein complexes are now known to be required for
   efficient double strand break repair. In a screen for microRNAs (miRNAs)
   that modulate the DNA damage response, we discovered that expression of
   the miR-99 family of miRNAs correlates with radiation sensitivity. These
   miRNAs were also transiently induced following radiation. The nniRNAs
   target the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor SNF2H/SMARCA5, a
   component of the ACF1 complex. We found that by reducing levels of
   SNF2H, miR-99a and miR-100 reduced BRCA1 localization to sites of DNA
   damage. Introduction of the miR-99 family of miRNAs into cells reduced
   the rate and overall efficiency of repair by both homologous
   recombination and non-homologous end joining. Finally, induction of the
   miR-99 family following radiation prevents an increase in SNF2H
   expression and reduces the recruitment of BRCA1 to the sites of DNA
   damage following a second dose of radiation, reducing the efficiency of
   repair after multiple rounds of radiation, as used in fractionated
   radiotherapy. Oncogene (2013) 32, 1164-1172; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.131;

TI Structure of an actin-related subcomplex of the SWI/SNF chromatin
   remodeler
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The packaging of DNA into nucleosomal structures limits access for
   templated processes such as transcription and DNA repair. The
   repositioning or ejection of nucleosomes is therefore critically
   important for regulated events, including gene expression. This activity
   is provided by chromatin remodeling complexes, or remodelers, which are
   typically large, multisubunit complexes that use an ATPase subunit to
   translocate the DNA. Many remodelers contain pairs or multimers of
   actin-related proteins (ARPs) that contact the helicase-SANT-associated
   (HSA) domain within the catalytic ATPase subunit and are thought to
   regulate ATPase activity. Here, we determined the structure of a
   four-protein subcomplex within the SWI/SNF remodeler that comprises the
   Snf2 HSA domain, Arp7, Arp9, and repressor of Tyl transposition, gene
   102 (Rtt102). Surprisingly, unlike characterized actin-actin
   associations, the two ARPs pack like spoons and straddle the HSA domain,
   which forms a 92-angstrom-long helix. The ARP-HSA interactions are
   reminiscent of contacts between actin and many binding partners and are
   quite different from those in the Arp2/3 complex. Rtt102 wraps around
   one side of the complex in a highly extended conformation that contacts
   both ARPs and therefore stabilizes the complex, yet functions to reduce
   by similar to 2.4-fold the remodeling and ATPase activity of complexes
   containing the Snf2 ATPase domain. Thus, our structure provides a
   foundation for developing models Of remodeler function, including
   mechanisms of coupling between ARPs and the ATPase translocation
   activity.

TI Regulation of Leaf Maturation by Chromatin-Mediated Modulation of
   Cytokinin Responses
SO DEVELOPMENTAL CELL
AB Plant shoots display indeterminate growth, while their evolutionary
   decedents, the leaves, are determinate. Determinate leaf growth is
   conditioned by the CIN-TCP transcription factors, which promote leaf
   maturation and are negatively regulated by miR319 in leaf primordia.
   Here we show that CIN-TCPs reduce leaf sensitivity to cytokinin (CK), a
   phytohormone implicated in inhibition of differentiation in the shoot.
   We identify the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) as a
   genetic mediator of CIN-TCP activities and CK responses. An interactome
   screen further revealed that SWI/SNF complex components including BRM
   preferentially interacted with basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
   transcription factors and the bHLH-related CIN-TCPs. Indeed, TCP4 and
   BRM interacted in planta. Both TCP4 and BRM bound the promoter of an
   inhibitor of CK responses, ARR16, and induced its expression.
   Reconstituting ARR16 levels in leaves with reduced CIN-TCP activity
   restored normal growth. Thus, CIN-TCP and BRM together promote
   determinate leaf growth by stage-specific modification of OK responses.

TI E-cadherin gene re-expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by
   HDAC inhibitors
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: The tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin gene is frequently
   silenced in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and results in
   wnt-pathway activation. We analyzed the role of histone epigenetic
   modifications in E-cadherin gene silencing.
   Methods: CLL specimens were treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor
   (HDACi) MS-275 and analyzed for E-cadherin expression with western blot
   and RT-PCR analysis. The downstream effects of HDACi treated leukemic
   cells were studied by analyzing the effect on wnt-pathway signaling.
   HDACi induced alterations in E-cadherin splicing were investigated by
   transcript specific real time PCR analysis.
   Results: Treatment of CLL specimens with histone deacetylase inhibitors
   (HDACi) treatment resulted in an increase of the E-cadherin RNA
   transcript (5 to 119 fold increase, n=10) in eight out of ten CLL
   specimens indicating that this gene is down regulated by histone
   hypoacetylation in a majority of CLL specimens. The E-cadherin
   re-expression in CLL specimens was noted by western blot analysis as
   well. Besides epigenetic silencing another mechanism of E-cadherin
   inactivation is aberrant exon 11 splicing resulting in an alternatively
   spliced transcript that lacks exon 11 and is degraded by the non-sense
   mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation
   experiments show that HDACi increased the acetylation of histones H3 and
   H4 in the E-cadherin promoter region. This also affected the E-cadherin
   exon 11 splicing pattern as HDACi treated CLL specimens preferentially
   expressed the correctly spliced transcript and not the exon 11 skipped
   aberrant transcript. The re-expressed E-cadherin binds to beta-catenin
   with inhibition of the active wnt-beta-catenin pathway in these cells.
   This resulted in a down regulation of two wnt target genes, LEF and
   cyclinD1 and the wnt pathway reporter.
   Conclusion: The E-cadherin gene is epigenetically modified and
   hypoacetylated in CLL leukemic cells. Treatment of CLL specimens with
   HDACi MS-275 activates transcription from this silent gene with
   expression of more correctly spliced E-cadherin transcripts as compared
   to the aberrant exon11 skipped transcripts that in turn inhibits the wnt
   signaling pathway. The data highlights the role of epigenetic
   modifications in altering gene splicing patterns.

TI Recruitment of Histone Methyltransferase G9a Mediates Transcriptional
   Repression of Fgf21 Gene by E4BP4 Protein
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The liver responds to fasting-refeeding cycles by reprogramming
   expression of metabolic genes. Fasting potently induces one of the key
   hepatic hormones, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), to promote
   lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis, whereas refeeding
   suppresses its expression. We previously reported that the basic leucine
   zipper transcription factor E4BP4 (E4 binding protein 4) represses Fgf21
   expression and disrupts its circadian oscillations in cultured
   hepatocytes. However, the epigenetic mechanism for E4BP4-dependent
   suppression of Fgf21 has not yet been addressed. Here we present
   evidence that histone methyltransferase G9a mediates E4BP4-dependent
   repression of Fgf21 during refeeding by promoting repressive histone
   modification. We find that Fgf21 expression is up-regulated in E4bp4
   knock-out mouse liver. We demonstrate that the G9a-specific inhibitor
   BIX01294 abolishes suppression of the Fgf21 promoter activity by E4BP4,
   whereas overexpression of E4bp4 leads to increased levels of
   dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) around the Fgf21 promoter
   region. Furthermore, we also show that E4BP4 interacts with G9a, and
   knockdown of G9a blocks repression of Fgf21 promoter activity and
   expression in cells overexpressing E4bp4. A G9a mutant lacking catalytic
   activity, due to deletion of the SET domain, fails to inhibit the Fgf21
   promoter activity. Importantly, acute hepatic knockdown by adenoviral
   shRNA targeting G9a abolishes Fgf21 repression by refeeding, concomitant
   with decreased levels of H3K9me2 around the Fgf21 promoter region. In
   summary, we show that G9a mediates E4BP4-dependent suppression of
   hepatic Fgf21 by enhancing histone methylation (H3K9me2) of the Fgf21
   promoter.

TI Current trends in the development and application of molecular
   technologies for cancer epigenetics
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Current progress in epigenetic research supports the view that diet and
   dietary components are important in cancer etiology by enhancing or
   inhibiting carcinogenesis. Since diet and dietary factors may
   significantly contribute to the causation and progression of many
   cancers, it is important to find the molecular mechanisms of action of
   such dietary factors for cancer prevention and treatment. Recently, the
   role of epigenetic mechanisms in the cancer development and progression
   has attracted more attention as additional evidence along with
   traditional DNA sequence based mechanisms such as mutations and
   structural re-arrangements. Such an increasing interest in cancer
   epigenetics has also accelerated the development and application of
   molecular assays and tools for DNA methylation detection and histone
   modification enrichment analysis. In this paper, key assays and methods
   for epigenetic research are reviewed and discussed in terms of their
   utility and usability. In addition, more advanced methods for
   genome-wide analysis are introduced as part of upcoming research trends
   and directions. (C) 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI Activation of DSB Processing Requires Phosphorylation of CtIP by ATR
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate a DNA damage response (DDR)
   that coordinates checkpoint pathways with DNA repair. ATM and AIR
   kinases are activated sequentially. Homology-directed repair (HDR) is
   initiated by resection of DSBs to generate 3' single-stranded DNA
   overhangs. How resection and HDR are activated during DDR is not known,
   nor are the roles of ATM and AIR in HDR. Here, we show that CtIP
   undergoes ATR-dependent hyperphosphorylation in response to DSBs. AIR
   phosphorylates an invariant threonine, T818 of Xenopus CtIP (1859 in
   human). Nonphosphorylatable CUP (T818A) does not bind to chromatin or
   initiate resection. Our data support a model in which ATM activity is
   required for an early step in resection, leading to AIR activation,
   CtIP-T818 phosphorylation, and accumulation of CtIP on chromatin.
   Chromatin binding by modified CtIP precedes extensive resection and full
   checkpoint activation.

TI Development of neurodevelopmental disorders: a regulatory mechanism
   involving bromodomain-containing proteins
SO JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
AB Neurodevelopmental disorders are classified as diseases that cause
   abnormal functions of the brain or central nervous system. Children with
   neurodevelopmental disorders show impaired language and speech
   abilities, learning and memory damage, and poor motor skills. However,
   we still know very little about the molecular etiology of these
   disorders. Recent evidence implicates the bromodomain-containing
   proteins (BCPs) in the initiation and development of neurodevelopmental
   disorders. BCPs have a particular domain, the bromodomain (Brd), which
   was originally identified as specifically binding acetyl-lysine residues
   at the N-terminus of histone proteins in vitro and in vivo. Other
   domains of BCPs are responsible for binding partner proteins to form
   regulatory complexes. Once these complexes are assembled, BCPs alter
   chromosomal states and regulate gene expression. Some BCP complexes bind
   nucleosomes, are involved in basal transcription regulation, and
   influence the transcription of many genes. However, most BCPs are
   involved in targeting. For example, some BCPs function as a recruitment
   platform or scaffold through their Brds-binding targeting sites. Others
   are recruited to form a complex to bind the targeting sites of their
   partners. The regulation mediated by these proteins is especially
   critical during normal and abnormal development. Mutant BCPs or
   dysfunctional BCP-containing complexes are implicated in the initiation
   and development of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the pathogenic
   molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this review, we focus
   on the roles of regulatory BCPs associated with neurodevelopmental
   disorders, including mental retardation, Fragile X syndrome (FRX),
   Williams syndrome (WS), Rett syndrome and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome
   (RTS). A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, based upon
   the roles of BCPs, will lead to screening of targets for the treatment
   of neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI Dependence receptor TrkC is a putative colon cancer tumor suppressor
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The TrkC neurotrophin receptor belongs to the functional dependence
   receptor family, members of which share the ability to induce apoptosis
   in the absence of their ligands. Such a trait has been hypothesized to
   confer tumor-suppressor activity. Indeed, cells that express these
   receptors are thought to be dependent on ligand availability for their
   survival, a mechanism that inhibits uncontrolled tumor cell
   proliferation and migration. TrkC is a classic tyrosine kinase receptor
   and therefore generally considered to be a protooncogene. We show here
   that TrkC expression is down-regulated in a large fraction of human
   colorectal cancers, mainly through promoter methylation. Moreover, we
   show that TrkC silencing by promoter methylation is a selective
   advantage for colorectal cell lines to limit tumor cell death.
   Furthermore, reestablished TrkC expression in colorectal cancer cell
   lines is associated with tumor cell death and inhibition of in vitro
   characteristics of cell transformation, as well as in vivo tumor growth.
   Finally, we provide evidence that a mutation of TrkC detected in a
   sporadic cancer is a loss-of-proapoptotic function mutation. Together,
   these data support the conclusion that TrkC is a colorectal cancer tumor
   suppressor.

TI S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 regulates the expression of the
   chromatin-remodeling factor Brm during radial neuron migration
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Dynamic epigenetic modifications play a key role in mediating the
   expression of genes required for neuronal development. We previously
   identified nitric oxide (NO) as a signaling molecule that mediates
   S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and epigenetic changes
   in neurons. Here, we show that HDAC2 nitrosylation regulates neuronal
   radial migration during cortical development. Bead-array analysis
   performed in the developing cortex revealed that brahma (Brm), a subunit
   of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex BRG/brahma-associated
   factor, is one of the genes regulated by S-nitrosylation of HDAC2. In
   the cortex, expression of a mutant form of HDAC2 that cannot be
   nitrosylated dramatically inhibits Brm expression. Our study identifies
   NO and HDAC2 nitrosylation as part of a signaling pathway that regulates
   cortical development and the expression of Brm in neurons.

TI Landscape of somatic single-nucleotide and copy-number mutations in
   uterine serous carcinoma
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is a biologically aggressive subtype of
   endometrial cancer. We analyzed the mutational landscape of USC by
   whole-exome sequencing of 57 cancers, most of which were matched to
   normal DNA from the same patients. The distribution of the number of
   protein-altering somatic mutations revealed that 52 USC tumors had fewer
   than 100 (median 36), whereas 5 had more than 3,000 somatic mutations.
   The mutations in these latter tumors showed hallmarks of defects in DNA
   mismatch repair. Among the remainder, we found a significantly increased
   burden of mutation in 14 genes. In addition to well-known cancer genes
   (i.e., TP53, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, KRAS, FBXW7), there were frequent
   mutations in CHD4/Mi2b, a member of the NuRD-chromatin-remodeling
   complex, and TAF1, an element of the core TFIID transcriptional
   machinery. Additionally, somatic copy-number variation was found to play
   an important role in USC, with 13 copy-number gains and 12 copy-number
   losses that occurred more often than expected by chance. In addition to
   loss of TP53, we found frequent deletion of a small segment of
   chromosome 19 containing MBD3, also a member of the
   NuRD-chromatin-modification complex, and frequent amplification of
   chromosome segments containing PIK3CA, ERBB2 (an upstream activator of
   PIK3CA), and CCNE1 (a target of FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination). These
   findings identify frequent mutation of DNA damage, chromatin remodeling,
   cell cycle, and cell proliferation pathways in USC and suggest potential
   targets for treatment of this lethal variant of endometrial cancer.

TI Transgenerational Epigenetic Effects on Brain Functions
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Psychiatric diseases are multifaceted disorders with complex etiology,
   recognized to have strong heritable components. Despite intense research
   efforts, genetic loci that substantially account for disease
   heritability have not yet been identified. Over the last several years,
   epigenetic processes have emerged as important factors for many brain
   diseases, and the discovery of epigenetic processes in germ cells has
   raised the possibility that they may contribute to disease heritability
   and disease risk. This review examines epigenetic mechanisms in complex
   diseases and summarizes the most illustrative examples of
   transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals and their relevance
   for brain function. Environmental factors that can affect molecular
   processes and behavior in exposed individuals and their offspring, and
   their potential epigenetic underpinnings, are described. Possible routes
   and mechanisms of transgenerational transmission are proposed, and the
   major questions and challenges raised by this emerging field of research
   are considered.

TI Impact of stump harvest on run-off concentrations of total mercury and
   methylmercury
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Forest harvesting operations have been reported to increase the levels
   of both total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in runoff water and
   downstream biota. Mobilization of such harmful substances by logging may
   pose ecological risks that may be influenced further by site preparation
   and stump harvest. Stump harvest is currently being explored as a method
   to increase the supply of biofuels. In this catchment study we
   investigated the effects of stump harvest, in comparison with ordinary
   site-preparation, on the runoff concentrations of THg and MeHg as well
   as several other chemistry parameters. Both treatments were also
   compared with unharvested reference catchments. Water samples from
   watercourses draining these catchments were analyzed for various
   variables including THg, MeHg, total organic carbon, absorbance and
   total suspended solids. One year of pre-treatment data, starting when
   the treated areas were just logged, and 2 years of post-treatment data,
   after stump harvest or site-preparation, were collected with a sample
   frequency of twice a month.
   The concentrations of THg and MeHg in the treated areas were decreasing
   after both stump harvest and site preparation relative to the reference
   catchment. Further, our results indicate that stump harvest has not
   caused increased concentrations of any of the studied parameters in
   relation to traditional site preparation. Two factors are proposed to be
   responsible for the lack of response to stump harvest and site
   preparation; (1) the areas are still undergoing recovery from the former
   logging which may have led to greater Hg export and/or (2) there is
   variability among sites in how they respond to forestry operations,
   depending on the biogeochemical and hydrological status of the area.
   Although no forestry response caused by stump harvest or site
   preparation was found, we noted that the concentrations of both THg and
   especially MeHg were high (median THg: 4.5-10.4 ng L(-1), median MeHg:
   0.7-2.1 ng L(-1)) in all catchments both before and after treatment,
   compared to other studies. Variables indicating the organic carbon
   content were the ones most strongly correlated to the variation of both
   THg and MeHg in the PLS models based on the dataset from the whole
   sampling period and all catchments. The relatively high concentrations
   of THg and MeHg during the study period appeared to be more influenced
   by organic carbon, but also hydrology and temperature as well as
   possibly the initial logging rather than by the soil disturbance caused
   by either stump harvest or site preparation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

TI DNMT1 represses p53 to maintain progenitor cell survival during

SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB In the developing pancreas, self-renewal of progenitors and patterning

   apoptosis of progenitor cells. We show that DNMT1 is bound to the p53
   regulatory region and that loss of Dnmt1 results in derepression of the

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to
   vascular injury plays a critical role in vascular lesion formation.
   Emerging data suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
   gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1) is a key regulator of energy metabolism and

   beta in VSMCs remains unknown. A decrease in PGC-1 beta expression was

   overexpression substantially inhibited neointima formation in vivo and
   markedly inhibited VSMC proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at
   the G(1)/S transition phase in vitro. Accordingly, overexpression of
   PGC-1 beta decreased the expression of minichromosome maintenance 4
   (MCM4), which leads to a decreased loading of the MCM complex onto
   chromatin at the replication origins and decreased cyclin D1 levels,
   whereas PGC-1 beta loss of function by adenovirus containing PGC-1 beta
   shRNA resulted in the opposite effect. The transcription factor AP-1 was
   involved in the down-regulation of MCM4 expression. Furthermore, PGC-1
   beta is up-regulated by metformin, and metformin-associated
   anti-proliferative activity in VSMCs is at least partially dependent on
   PGC-1 beta. Our data show that PGC-1 beta is a critical component in
   regulating DNA replication, VSMC proliferation, and vascular lesion
   formation, suggesting that PGC-1 beta may emerge as a novel therapeutic
   target for control of proliferative vascular diseases.

TI The microRNA miR-7 regulates Tramtrack69 in a developmental switch in
   Drosophila follicle cells
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Development in multicellular organisms includes both small incremental
   changes and major switches of cell differentiation and proliferation
   status. During Drosophila oogenesis, the follicular epithelial cells
   undergo two major developmental switches that cause global changes in
   the cell-cycle program. One, the switch from the endoreplication cycle
   to a gene-amplification phase, during which special genomic regions
   undergo repeated site-specific replication, is attributed to Notch
   downregulation, ecdysone signaling activation and upregulation of the
   zinc-finger protein Tramtrack69 (Ttk69). Here, we report that the
   microRNA miR-7 exerts an additional layer of regulation in this
   developmental switch by regulating Ttk69 transcripts. miR-7 recognizes
   the 3' UTR of ttk69 transcripts and regulates Ttk69 expression in a
   dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-7 effectively blocks the
   switch from the endocycle to gene amplification through its regulation
   of ttk69. miR-7 and Ttk69 also coordinate other cell differentiation
   events, such as vitelline membrane protein expression, that lead to the
   formation of the mature egg. Our studies reveal the important role miR-7
   plays in developmental decision-making in association with
   signal-transduction pathways.

TI Improvement of left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction
   with eight weeks L-thyroxine treatment in rats
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Left ventricular (LV) remodeling following large transmural
   myocardial infarction (MI) remains a pivotal clinical issue despite the
   advance of medical treatment over the past few decades. Identification
   of new medications to improve the remodeling process and prevent
   progression to heart failure after MI is critical. Thyroid hormones
   (THs) have been shown to improve LV function and remodeling in animals
   post-MI and in the human setting. However, changes in underlying
   cellular remodeling resulting from TH treatment are not clear.
   Methods: MI was produced in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats by ligation
   of the left descending coronary artery. L-thyroxine (T4) pellet (3.3 mg,
   60 days sustained release) was used to treat MI rats for 8 weeks.
   Isolated myocyte shape, arterioles, and collagen deposition in the
   non-infarcted area were measured at terminal study.
   Results: T4 treatment improved LV +/- dp/dt, normalized TAU, and
   increased myocyte cross-sectional area without further increasing
   myocyte length in MI rats. T4 treatment increased the total LV tissue
   area by 34%, increased the non-infarcted tissue area by 41%, and
   increased the thickness of non-infarcted area by 36% in MI rats.
   However, myocyte volume accounted for only similar to 1/3 of the
   increase in myocyte mass in the non-infarct area, indicating the
   presence of more myocytes with treatment. T4 treatment tended to
   increase the total length of smaller arterioles (5 to 15 mu m)
   proportional to LV weight increase and also decreased collagen
   deposition in the LV non-infarcted area. A tendency for increased
   metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinases (TIMPs) -1 to -4 expression was also observed in T4
   treated MI rats.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that long-term T4 treatment after MI
   has beneficial effects on myocyte, arteriolar, and collagen matrix
   remodeling in the non-infarcted area. Most importantly, results suggest
   improved survival of myocytes in the peri-infarct area.

TI Expression of Sox4 and Sox11 is regulated by multiple mechanisms during
   retinal development
SO FEBS LETTERS
AB Sox11 and Sox4 play critical roles in retinal development, during which
   they display specific and unique expression patterns. The expression of
   Sox11 and Sox4 is temporally sequential, albeit spatially overlapping in
   some retinal subtypes. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses
   suggested that Notch signaling suppresses Sox4 expression in the early
   developing retina but not during the later period of development. The
   levels of histone H3-acetylation and H3-lysine 4 trimethylation at the
   Sox11 locus declined during development, as did the levels of Sox11. A
   similar but less marked change was seen for Sox4. For both genes,
   histone H3-lysine 27 methylation was low during development and
   increased markedly in the adult. (C) 2013 Federation of European

TI Virtual anthropology: A comparison between the performance of
   conventional X-ray and MDCT in investigating the trabecular structure of
   long bones
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB Recently, modern cross-sectional imaging techniques such as
   multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) have pioneered post mortem
   investigations, especially in forensic medicine. Such approaches can
   also be used to investigate bones non-invasively for anthropological
   purposes. Long bones are often examined in forensic cases because they
   are frequently discovered and transferred to medico-legal departments
   for investigation. To estimate their age, the trabecular structure must
   be examined. This study aimed to compare the performance of MDCT with
   conventional X-rays to investigate the trabecular structure of long
   bones. Fifty-two dry bones (24 humeri and 28 femora) from
   anthropological collections were first examined by conventional X-ray,
   and then by MDCT. Trabecular structure was evaluated by seven observers
   (two experienced and five inexperienced in anthropology) who analyzed
   images obtained by radiological methods. Analyses contained the
   measurement of one quantitative parameter (caput diameter of humerus and
   femur) and staging the trabecular structure of each bone. Preciseness of
   each technique was indicated by describing areas of trabecular
   destruction and particularities of the bones, such as pathological
   changes. Concerning quantitative parameters, the measurements
   demonstrate comparable results for the MDCT and conventional X-ray
   techniques. In contrast, the overall inter-observer reliability of the
   staging was low with MDCT and conventional X-ray. Reliability increased
   significantly when only the results of the staging performed by the two
   experienced observers were compared, particularly regarding the MDCT
   analysis. Our results also indicate that MDCT appears to be better
   suited to a detailed examination of the trabecular structure. In our
   opinion, MDCT is an adequate tool with which to examine the trabecular
   structure of long bones. However, adequate methods should be developed
   or existing methods should be adapted to MDCT. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland

TI LSD2/KDM1B and Its Cofactor NPAC/GLYR1 Endow a Structural and Molecular
   Model for Regulation of H3K4 Demethylation
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Dynamic regulation of histone methylation represents a fundamental
   epigenetic mechanism underlying eukaryotic gene regulation, yet little
   is known about how the catalytic activities of histone demethylases are
   regulated. Here, we identify and characterize NPAC/GLYR1 as an
   LSD2/KDM1b-specific cofactor that stimulates H3K4me1 and H3K4me2
   demethylation. We determine the crystal structures of LSD2 alone and
   LSD2 in complex with the NPAC linker region in the absence or presence
   of histone H3 peptide, at resolutions of 2.9, 2.0, and 2.25 angstrom,
   respectively. These crystal structures and further biochemical
   characterization define a dodecapeptide of NPAC (residues 214-225) as
   the minimal functional unit for its cofactor activity and provide
   structural determinants and a molecular mechanism underlying the
   intrinsic cofactor activity of NPAC in stimulating LSD2-catalyzed H3K4
   demethylation. Thus, these findings establish a model for how a cofactor
   directly regulates histone demethylation and will have a significant
   impact on our understanding of catalytic-activity-based epigenetic
   regulation.

TI BRG1-mediated immune tolerance: facilitation of Treg activation and
   partial independence of chromatin remodelling
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB Treg activation in response to environmental cues is necessary for
   regulatory T cells (Tregs) to suppress inflammation, but little is known
   about the transcription mechanisms controlling Treg activation. We
   report that despite the known proinflammatory role of the
   chromatin-remodelling factor BRG1 in CD4 cells, deleting Brg1 in all ab
   T cell lineages led to fatal inflammation, which reflected essential
   roles of BRG1 in Tregs. Brg1 deletion impaired Treg activation,
   concomitant with the onset of the inflammation. Remarkably, as the
   inflammation progressed, Tregs became increasingly activated, but the
   activation levels could not catch up with the severity of inflammation.
   In vitro assays indicate that BRG1 regulates a subset of TCR target
   genes including multiple chemokine receptor genes. Finally, using a
   method that can create littermates bearing either a tissue-specific
   point mutation or deletion, we found the BRG1 ATPase activity partially
   dispensable for BRG1 function. Collectively, these data suggest that
   BRG1 acts in part via remodelling-independent functions to sensitize
   Tregs to inflammatory cues, thus allowing Tregs to promptly and
   effectively suppress autoimmunity.

TI Chtop is a component of the dynamic TREX mRNA export complex
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB The TREX complex couples nuclear pre-mRNA processing with mRNA export
   and contains multiple protein components, including Uap56, Alyref, Cip29
   and the multi-subunit THO complex. Here, we have identified Chtop as a
   novel TREX component. We show that both Chtop and Alyref activate the
   ATPase and RNA helicase activities of Uap56 and that Uap56 functions to
   recruit both Alyref and Chtop onto mRNA. As observed with the THO
   complex subunit Thoc5, Chtop binds to the NTF2-like domain of Nxf1, and
   this interaction requires arginine methylation of Chtop. Using RNAi, we
   show that co-knockdown of Alyref and Chtop results in a potent mRNA
   export block. Chtop binds to Uap56 in a mutually exclusive manner with
   Alyref, and Chtop binds to Nxf1 in a mutually exclusive manner with
   Thoc5. However, Chtop, Thoc5 and Nxf1 exist in a single complex in vivo.
   Together, our data indicate that TREX and Nxf1 undergo dynamic
   remodelling, driven by the ATPase cycle of Uap56 and post-translational
   modifications of Chtop.

TI Dickkopf-1 inhibits thyroid cancer cell survival and migration through
   regulation of beta-catenin/E-cadherin signaling
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a role in tumorigenesis of human
   papillary thyroid cancer (FTC). Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) is an inhibitor of
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We investigated the therapeutic potential of
   Dkk-1 in human FTC cell lines, SNU-790, B-CPAP, and BHP10-3. Dkk-1
   reversed the aberrant expression of beta-catenin from nucleus to
   membrane and inhibited basal levels of TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional
   activities. Furthermore, Dkk-1 inhibited cell viability in a
   dose-dependent manner and adenoviral transduction of constitutively
   active beta-catenin blocked these effects, thus suggesting that the
   Dkk-1 anti-tumoral effect is mediated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
   Bromodeoxyuridine assay showed minimal effects of Dkk-1 on cell
   proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V staining showed
   marked induction of cell apoptosis by Dkk-1 treatment. Dkk-1 also
   restored the loss of membranous E-cadherin expression with consequent
   inhibition of cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, Dkk-1
   inhibited the survival and migration of human FTC cells by regulating
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and E-cadherin expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI The Use of the Harmonic Scalpel Versus Knot Tying for Modified Radical
   Neck Dissection
SO SURGICAL INNOVATION
AB Background. Although the utility of the harmonic scalpel (HS) in
   thyroidectomy has been extensively demonstrated, there is little
   experience regarding its use for neck dissections. Methods. Within 10
   years, 119 patients underwent modified radical neck dissection (MRND)
   for thyroid cancer. In 51 patients, MRND was performed using
   conventional knot tying and in 68 using the HS. The number of lymph
   nodes (LNs) removed, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), drain
   output, duration of the drainage, and complications were compared for 47
   patients undergoing first-time unilateral MRND without concomitant
   additional surgical procedures. Results. The number of LNs removed,
   operative time, duration of drainage, and rate of lymphatic leak were
   similar between groups. For the HS group, EBL (5 +/- 3 vs 32 +/- 10; P =
   .006) and drain output on postoperative day 1 (51.7 +/- 6.2 vs 78.9 +/-
   11.9; P = .02) and at 1 week (6.1 +/- 1.2 vs 10.2 +/- 1.8, respectively;
   P = .03) were significantly less. Conclusion. Despite the limitations of
   its retrospective nature, this study shows that the HS reduces EBL and
   the amount of lymphatic drainage compared to knot tying after MRND.

TI Exomic Sequencing of Medullary Thyroid Cancer Reveals Dominant and
   Mutually Exclusive Oncogenic Mutations in RET and RAS
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare thyroid cancer that
   can occur sporadically or as part of a hereditary syndrome.
   Objective: To explore the genetic origin of MTC, we sequenced the
   protein coding exons of approximately 21,000 genes in 17 sporadic MTCs.
   Patients and Design: We sequenced the exomes of 17 sporadic MTCs and
   validated the frequency of all recurrently mutated genes and other genes
   of interest in an independent cohort of 40 MTCs comprised of both
   sporadic and hereditary MTC.
   Results: We discovered 305 high-confidence mutations in the 17 sporadic
   MTCs in the discovery phase, or approximately 17.9 somatic mutations per
   tumor. Mutations in RET, HRAS, and KRAS genes were identified as the
   principal driver mutations in MTC. All of the other additional somatic
   mutations, including mutations in spliceosome and DNA repair pathways,
   were not recurrent in additional tumors. Tumors without RET, HRAS, or
   KRAS mutations appeared to have significantly fewer mutations overall in
   protein coding exons.
   Conclusions: Approximately 90% of MTCs had mutually exclusive mutations
   in RET, HRAS, and KRAS, suggesting that RET and RAS are the predominant
   driver pathways in MTC. Relatively few mutations overall and no commonly
   recurrent driver mutations other than RET, HRAS, and KRAS were seen in
   the MTC exome. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: E364-E369, 2013)

TI Contribution of larval nutrition to adult reproduction in Drosophila
   melanogaster
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Within the complex life cycle of holometabolous insects, nutritional
   resources acquired during larval feeding are utilized by the pupa and
   the adult. The broad features of the transfer of larval resources to the
   pupae and the allocation of larval resources in the adult have been
   described by studies measuring and tracking macronutrients at different
   developmental stages. However, the mechanisms of resource transfer from
   the larva and the factors regulating the allocation of these resources
   in the adult between growth, reproduction and somatic maintenance are
   unknown. Drosophila melanogaster presents a tractable system in which to
   test cellular and tissue mechanisms of resource acquisition and
   allocation because of the detailed understanding of D. melanogaster
   development and the experimental tools to manipulate its tissues across
   developmental stages. In previous work, we demonstrated that the fat
   body of D. melanogaster larvae is important for survival of starvation
   stress in the young adult, and suggested that programmed cell death of
   the larval fat cells in the adult is important for allocation of
   resources for female reproduction. Here, we describe the temporal uptake
   of larval-derived carbon by the ovaries, and demonstrate the importance
   of larval fat-cell death in the maturation of the ovary and in
   fecundity. Larvae and adults were fed stable carbon isotopes to follow
   the acquisition of larval-derived carbon by the adult ovaries. We
   determined that over half of the nutrients acquired by the ovaries in
   2-day-old adult females are dependent upon the death of the fat cells.
   Furthermore, when programmed cell death is inhibited in the larval fat
   cells, ovarian development was depressed and fecundity was reduced.

TI Sustained sleep fragmentation affects brain temperature, food intake and
   glucose tolerance in mice
SO JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB Sleep fragmentation is present in numerous sleep pathologies and
   constitutes a major feature of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. A
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity has been shown to
   be associated to obstructive sleep apnea. While sleep fragmentation has
   been shown to impact sleep homeostasis, its specific effects on
   metabolic variables are only beginning to emerge. In this context, it is
   important to develop realistic animal models that would account for
   chronic metabolic effects of sleep fragmentation. We developed a 14-day
   model of instrumental sleep fragmentation in mice, and show an impact on
   both brain-specific and general metabolism. We first report that sleep
   fragmentation increases food intake without affecting body weight. This
   imbalance was accompanied by the inability to adequately decrease brain
   temperature during fragmented sleep. In addition, we report that
   sleep-fragmented mice develop glucose intolerance. We also observe that
   sleep fragmentation slightly increases the circadian peak level of
   glucocorticoids, a factor that may be involved in the observed metabolic
   effects. Our results confirm that poor-quality sleep with sustained
   sleep fragmentation has similar effects on general metabolism as actual
   sleep loss. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that sleep
   fragmentation is an aggravating factor for the development of metabolic
   dysfunctions that may be relevant for sleep disorders such as
   obstructive sleep apnea.

TI Effects of azacitidine on matrix metalloproteinase-9 in acute myeloid
   leukemia and myelodysplasia
SO EXPERIMENTAL HEMATOLOGY
AB Matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP9) plays a critical role in acute myeloid
   leukemia (AML) by increasing the invasive properties of malignant
   myeloblasts. The role of this enzyme in high-risk myelodysplastic
   diseases (MDS) and the effect of azacitidine on its expression in MDS
   and AML have not been studied in detail. In this work, we have analyzed
   the effect of different concentrations of azacitidine in two
   well-established, MDS-derived, acute myeloid leukemic cell lines:
   MOLM-13 and SKM-1. We have demonstrated that 1 mu mol/L azacitidine
   decreases MMP9 DNA methylation levels and that this is correlated with a
   significant increase in messenger RNA expression in both cell lines.
   Surprisingly, changes in protein levels were minor. This paradoxic
   effect is explained by the drug-dependent induction of apoptosis that
   reduces the amount of active secreting cells. A balance between induced
   expression and apoptosis was established at an azacitidine concentration
   of 0.2 mu mol/L in MOLM-13 cells. This dose significantly increased the
   invasive capacity of viable cells, as measured in the Matrigel assay. To
   evaluate the clinical relevance of this observation, we have examined
   the effect of azacitidine on MMP9 expression in bone marrow from five
   patients with MDS, with the finding that this drug significantly
   increased MMP9 protein levels in all analyzed patients after six cycles
   of treatment. Based on these results, we conclude that azacitidine
   increases MMP9 expression and may enhance invasiveness in vitro. Because
   all five patients relapsed, these findings might explain, at least
   partially, the clinical failure of the drug and the progression to a
   more aggressive disease. (C) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem

TI The serrated pathway to colorectal carcinoma: current concepts and
   challenges
SO HISTOPATHOLOGY
AB Approximately 30% of colorectal carcinomas develop via a serrated
   neoplasia pathway, named for the pattern of crypts in the precursor
   polyps. Molecular abnormalities consistently involve methylation of CpG
   islands [CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)] of low degree (CIMP-L)
   or high degree (CIMP-H), and activating mutations of the
   mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway components BRAF or KRAS.
   Microsatellite instability (MSI) of a high level (MSI-H) is often
   present, allowing for a molecular classification of serrated pathway
   carcinoma as: (i) BRAF mutant/CIMP-H with either a) MSI-H or b)
   microsatellite stable (MSS); and (ii) KRAS mutant/CIMP-L/MSS. Precursor
   polyps include sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), characterized by proximal
   location, crypt architectural disturbance, and BRAF mutation.
   Microvesicular hyperplasic polyp (MVHP) probably precedes the
   development of SSA, and borderline lesions between MVHP and SSA occur.
   Cytological dysplasia in SSA portends advanced genetic abnormality and a
   high risk of progression to carcinoma. The traditional serrated adenoma
   has a predilection for the left colon, tubulovillous architecture,
   eosinophilic cytoplasm, and frequent KRAS mutation. Serrated morphology
   carcinoma is a new World Health Organization subtype with
   well-differentiated, mucinous or trabecular patterns. It has frequent
   KRAS or BRAF mutations and a poor prognosis. This review provides an
   insight into the histology and molecular mechanisms driving these
   serrated pathway lesions.

TI Reality as the leading cause of stress: rethinking the impact of chronic
   stress in nature
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Chronic activation of the stress axis caused by long-term uncontrollable
   and unpredictable factors in the environment has been regarded as
   causing maladaptive and/or pathological effects, both by those studying
   animals in the laboratory and in nature. While pathology may apply to
   the former, I argue that it does not apply to the latter. Our thinking
   on the role of chronic stress in animals in nature has been heavily
   influenced by biomedical research, but much less so by the ecological
   and evolutionary context within which animals actually function. I argue
   that when such stressors occur (e.g. periods of high predation risk,
   food limitation, prolonged severe weather, social conflict, etc.),
   although the animal may be chronically stressed, its responses are
   adaptive and continue to promote fitness. Chronic stressors in nature
   can be subdivided into whether they are reactive (direct physiological
   challenges threatening homeostasis and not requiring cognitive
   processing for example, food limitation) or anticipatory (perceived to
   be threatening and requiring cognitive processing for example, high
   predation risk). For anticipatory stressors, their impact on the animal
   should not be based on their absolute duration (they may be acute), but
   rather by the duration of their physiological consequences. The
   anticipatory stressor of persistent high predation risk does not elicit
   chronic stress in all prey classes. Cyclic snowshoe hare and arctic
   ground squirrels exhibit evidence of chronic stress when predator
   numbers are high, but cyclic vole and noncyclic elk populations do not.
   I suggest that chronic stress has evolved to benefit the fitness of the
   former and not the later, with the key factors being lifespan and life
   history. I propose that chronic stress evolves in a species only if it
   is adaptive.

TI Circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in infants with congenital heart
   disease
SO ENDOCRINE
AB Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have associated
   extracardiac co-morbidities at the time of surgery and during ongoing
   growth and development. Perioperative events include disrupted glucose
   homeostasis, capillary leak, and fluid retention. The
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has an important role in
   homeostasis in that the secretion of cortisol contributes to the
   response to stress, glucose regulation, blood volume control, and immune
   regulation. We investigated the diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis in
   infants with CHD by measuring salivary cortisol in the morning
   (0600-0900 h-circadian peak) and evening (2100-2400 h-circadian nadir).
   Twenty-nine infants aged 12 weeks to 1 year were included: 16 with
   acyanotic disease (SpO(2) a parts per thousand yen 90 %) and 13 with
   cyanotic disease (SpO2 < 90 %). Morning salivary cortisol was similar
   between the two groups [acyanotic 7.0 nmol/L (1.8-23.1); cyanotic 9.7
   nmol/L (0.9-15.6); p = 0.68]. Evening salivary cortisol was similar
   between the two groups [acyanotic 0.9 nmol/L (0.2-8.5); cyanotic 1.4
   nmol/L (0.5-14.9); p = 0.32]. Both cyanotic and acyanotic groups
   demonstrated an intact diurnal rhythm. In conclusion, chronic hypoxia
   secondary to cyanotic CHD does not affect the circadian rhythm of the
   HPA axis. By 12 weeks of age, infants with hypoxia secondary to cyanotic
   CHD have a normal cortisol diurnal rhythm.

TI Particulate and Dissolved Trace Element Concentrations in Three Southern
   Ecuador Rivers Impacted by Artisanal Gold Mining
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Water and sediment samples were collected along river transects at three
   artisanal gold mining areas in southern Ecuador: Nambija,
   Portovelo-Zaruma, and Ponce Enriquez. Samples were analyzed for a suite
   of major and trace elements, including filtered/unfiltered water samples
   and stream flow measurements to determine dissolved/particulate loads.
   Results show that the Q. Calixto, Calera, and Siete rivers
   (corresponding to Nambija, Portovelo-Zaruma, and Ponce Enriquez mining
   areas, respectively) have substantial trace element contamination due to
   mining inputs. Dissolved concentrations were elevated at Calera and
   Siete relative to Q. Calixto, possibly reflecting the input of soluble
   cyano-metal complexes in mining zones where cyanidation is used in ore
   processing. A negative correlation was found between MeHg: THg ratios
   and pH, indicating an inverse relationship of mercury methylation with
   cyanidation (since cyanidation increases water pH). This was the first
   comprehensive study to examine an extensive suite of trace elements in
   both water and sediment at the three main gold mining areas of southern
   Ecuador, including dissolved and particulate loads, and the first study
   to report MeHg concentrations in the mercury-contaminated rivers.

TI Increased expression of pro-angiogenic factors and vascularization in
   thyroid hyperfunctioning adenomas with and without TSH receptor
   activating mutations
SO ENDOCRINE
AB Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN) are known to receive an
   increased blood influx necessary to sustain their high rate of growth
   and hormone production. Here, we investigated the expression of hematic
   and lymphatic vases in a series of 20 AFTN compared with the
   contralateral non-tumor tissues of the same patients, and the transcript
   levels of proteins involved in the control of vascular proliferation,
   including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
   platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and their receptors and the
   endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In parallel, the expression of
   the differentiation markers sodium/iodide symporter (NIS),
   thyroperoxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (Tg), and TSH receptor (TSHR) was
   also investigated. The data were further analyzed comparing subgroups of
   tumors with or without mutations in the TSHR gene. Analysis by means of
   CD31 and D2-40 immunostaining showed in AFTN an increased number of
   hematic, but not lymphatic, vessels in parallel with an enhanced
   proliferation rate shown by increased Ki67 staining. Quantitative RT-PCR
   analysis revealed an increase of VEGF, VEGFR1 and 2, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and
   eNOS expression in tumor versus normal tissues. Also, higher transcript
   levels of NIS, TPO, and Tg were detected. Comparison of the two
   subgroups of samples revealed only few differences in the expression of
   the genes examined. In conclusion, these data demonstrate an increased
   expression of angiogenesis-related factors associated with an enhanced
   proliferation of hematic, but not lymphatic, vessels in AFTNs. In this
   context, the presence of TSHR mutations may only slightly influence the
   expression of pro-angiogenic growth factors.

TI Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule Is a Marker for Thyroid
   Carcinoma Aggressiveness and Disease-Free Survival
SO THYROID
AB Background: Currently, there are no protein biomarkers for aggressive
   subtypes of thyroid carcinomas (TC) in clinical use that would allow for
   early detection and patient management. We hypothesized that activated
   leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM or CD166) expression in thyroid
   tissues will reveal ALCAM to be a potential diagnostic and/or prognostic
   marker for TC aggressiveness.
   Methods: Forty-five benign and 158 malignant thyroid tissues were
   analyzed for ALCAM expression using immunohistochemistry. ALCAM
   expression was correlated with different subtypes and
   clinicopathological features of TC, as well as patient disease-free
   survival.
   Results: Combined membranous and cytoplasmic (total) expression of ALCAM
   was significantly reduced in patients with poorly/undifferentiated
   (aggressive) TC as compared to well-differentiated (nonaggressive)
   tumors (p < 0.001; area-under-curve = 0.865, sensitivity = 82%,
   specificity = 74%). The decreased ALCAM expression in TC correlated
   significantly with extrathyroidal extension, distant metastasis, and TC
   histotype. Notably, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for follow-up data of
   134 patients revealed significantly reduced disease-free survival for
   patients with TC with decreased ALCAM membranous, cytoplasmic, and total
   expression. Median survival of patients with decreased cytoplasmic ALCAM
   expression was 6 years, as compared to 13.7 years for patients with
   higher ALCAM expression (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: ALCAM has the potential to serve as a diagnostic and
   prognostic biomarker for aggressive TC. This protein can be taken
   forward for analysis in sera of patients with TC to determine its
   applicability as a minimally invasive serum biomarker for TC
   aggressiveness and patient disease-free survival.

TI Stabilization of the promoter nucleosomes in nucleosome-free regions by
   the yeast Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB The yeast Cyc8 (also known as Ssn6)-Tup1 complex regulates gene
   expression through a variety of mechanisms, including positioning of
   nucleosomes over promoters of some target genes to limit accessibility
   to the transcription machinery. To further define the functions of
   Cyc8-Tup1 in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling, we performed
   genome-wide profiling of changes in nucleosome organization and gene
   expression that occur upon loss of CYC8 or TUN and observed extensive
   nucleosome alterations in both promoters and gene bodies of derepressed
   genes. Our improved nucleosome profiling and analysis approaches
   revealed low-occupancy promoter nucleosomes (P nucleosomes) at locations
   previously defined as nucleosome-free regions. In the absence of CYC8 or
   TUP1, this P nucleosome is frequently lost, whereas nudeosomes are
   gained at -1 and +1 positions, accompanying up-regulation of downstream
   genes. Our analysis of public ChIPseq data revealed that Cyc8 and Tup1
   preferentially bind TATA-containing promoters, which are also enriched
   in genes derepressed upon loss of CYC8 or TUP1. These results suggest
   that stabilization of the P nucleosome on TATA-containing promoters may
   be a central feature of the repressive chromatin architecture created by
   the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor, and that releasing the P nucleosome
   contributes to gene activation.

TI Radiation-induced translocations with reduced Haynaldia villosa

SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
AB Haynaldia villosa Schur. (syn. Dasypyrum villosum Candargy, 2n = 2x =
   14, genome VV), a species related to wheat, is highly resistant to
   powdery mildew. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 from H. villosa
   was introduced into common wheat by means of a translocation line T6VS
   center dot 6AL, where the 6VS chromosome arm of H. villosa was joined at
   the centromere with wheat chromosome arm 6AL. To develop small alien
   translocations, especially interstitial translocations of small alien
   chromosome segments, we irradiated mature female gametes of a T6VS
   center dot 6AL translocation line with gamma rays. More than 20 new
   translocations and deletions of 6V chromatin were obtained and
   subsequently used to map Pm21. Pm21 was located in a small region (FL
   0.45-0.58) by genomic in situ hybridization, molecular marker analysis,
   and powdery mildew response. Two homozygous translocation lines with
   small H. villosa chromosome fragments carrying Pm21 were identified by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular marker analysis: an
   interstitial translocation in which a small fragment of 6VS is inserted
   into chromosome 4B and a terminal translocation with a small fragment of
   6VS inserted into 1A. These small alien translocations are being
   transferred into an adapted elite wheat background by backcrossing to
   allow their easy use in breeding programs.

TI Effects of agricultural pesticides on the health of Rana pipiens frogs
   sampled from the field
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB There is evidence that over the last 30 years, there have been mass
   declines in diverse geographic locations among amphibian populations due
   to disease outbreaks. Multiple causes have been suggested to explain
   this increase in disease incidence. Among these, climate changes,
   environmental pollution and reduced water quality are gaining attention.
   Indeed, some chemicals of environmental concerns are known to alter the
   immune system. It is possible that exposure to these pollutants could
   alter the immune system of anurans and render them more susceptible to
   different pathogens. In this study, we sampled Rana pipiens in five
   different sites near St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) during the
   months of July and September in 2001. Two of these sites were protected
   areas, in which low levels of pesticides were detected, while the
   remaining three sites were located in areas with intensive corn and
   soybeans cultivations. Our results demonstrated that frogs living in
   agricultural regions are smaller in size and weight than frogs living in
   areas with lower levels of pesticides at both sampling times. Moreover,
   we have observed a significant decrease in the number of splenocytes
   (cellularity) and the phagocytic activity in frogs sampled in impacted
   sites. Taken together, these results suggest that frogs living in
   agricultural regions might be more vulnerable to infections and diseases
   through their smaller size and alteration of their immune system. Our
   results also contribute to the overall discussion on factors involved in
   amphibian declines.

TI Predator-induced stress and the ecology of fear
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Predator-induced stress has been used to exemplify the concept of stress
   for close to a century because almost everyone can imagine the terror of
   fleeing for one's life from a lion or a tiger. Yet, because it has been
   assumed to be acute and transitory, predator-induced stress has not been
   much studied by either comparative physiologists or population
   ecologists, until relatively recently. The focus in biomedical research
   has always been on chronic stress in humans, which most comparative
   physiologists would agree results from sustained psychological stress
   linked to mere thoughts rather than acute physical crises (like
   surviving a predator attack) or chronic physical challenges (such as a
   shortage of food). Population ecologists have traditionally focused
   solely on the acute physical crisis of surviving a direct predator
   attack rather than whether the risk of such an attack may have a
   sustained effect on other demographic processes (e.g. the birth rate).
   Demographic experiments have now demonstrated that exposure to predators
   or predator cues can have sustained effects that extend to affecting
   birth and survival in free-living animals, and a subset of these have
   documented associated physiological stress effects. These and similar
   results have prompted some authors to speak of an ecology of fear, but
   others object that the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding
   predation remain unknown. Recent biomedical studies on animals in the
   laboratory have demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues
   can induce sustained psychological stress that is directly comparable to
   chronic stress in humans, and this has now in fact become one of the
   most common stressors used in studies of the animal model of
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We review these recent findings
   and suggest ways the laboratory techniques developed to measure the
   neural circuitry of fear could be adapted for use on free-living animals
   in the field, in order to: (i) test whether predator risk induces
   sustained psychological stress in wild animals, comparable to chronic
   stress in humans and (ii) directly investigate the cognitive and
   emotional aspects of avoiding predation and hence the ecology of fear.

TI Ikaros promotes rearrangement of TCR genes in an Ikaros null thymoma
   cell line
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Ikaros is important in the development and maintenance of the lymphoid
   system, functioning in part by associating with chromatin-remodeling
   complexes. We have studied the functions of Ikaros in the transition
   from pre-T cell to the CD4+CD8+ thymocyte using an Ikaros null CD4CD8
   mouse thymoma cell line (JE131). We demonstrate that this cell line
   carries a single functional TCR gene rearrangement and expresses a
   surface pre-TCR. JE131 cells also carry nonfunctional rearrangements on
   both alleles of their TCR loci. Retroviral reintroduction of Ikaros
   dramatically increased the rate of transcription in the locus and TCR
   V/J recombination resulting in the appearance of many new TCR+ cells.
   The process is RAG dependent, requires switch/sucrose nonfermentable
   chromatin-remodeling complexes and is coincident with the binding of
   Ikaros to the TCR enhancer. Furthermore, knockdown of Mi2/nucleosome
   remodeling and deacetylase complexes increased the frequency of TCR
   rearrangement. Our data suggest that Ikaros controls V/J recombination
   in T cells by controlling access of the transcription and recombination
   machinery to the TCR loci. The JE131 cell line should prove to be a very
   useful tool for studying the molecular details of this and other
   processes involved in the pre-T cell to TCR+ CD4+CD8+ thymocyte
   transition.

TI The ecology of stress: effects of the social environment
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Many aspects of the social environment affect
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and increase
   circulating glucocorticoid concentrations. In this review, we examine
   the relationships between the social environment and the function of the
   HPA axis in vertebrates. First, we explore the effects of the social
   environment on glucocorticoid secretion in territorial (primarily
   non-social) species, with an emphasis on the effects of variation in
   population density, as modified by environmental factors such as
   predation risk and food availability. In general, high population
   density or frequent territorial intrusions are associated with increased
   glucocorticoid secretion in a wide range of taxa, including mammals,
   birds, fish and reptiles, although there is considerable variability
   across species. Second, we consider the effects of social interactions
   and dominance rank on glucocorticoid secretion in social species, mostly
   in birds and mammals. We review studies that have detected an
   association between social status and glucocorticoid levels sometimes
   with higher glucocorticoid levels in low-ranking individuals, and
   sometimes with higher glucocorticoid levels in dominant individuals. The
   relationship between dominance and glucocorticoid levels varies among
   species, populations and years, in a manner that depends on the
   stability of the social hierarchy, environmental conditions, the type of
   breeding system, and the manner in which high rank is obtained and
   maintained. Finally, we discuss the concept of allostasis and consider
   interactions between social effects and other environmental factors,
   noting that there is relatively little research on these interactions to
   date. For both non-social and social species, we identify priorities of
   future research. These priorities include more complete descriptions of
   HPA function that move beyond measurements of basal glucocorticoid
   concentrations (which will generally require field experiments), to
   studies that examine organizational effects of social stressors, that
   directly test the relationship between HPA function and fitness, and
   that examine how glucocorticoid responses affect population dynamics.
   Although several lines of evidence suggest that glucocorticoid responses
   can affect the fitness of individuals and therefore can alter the
   dynamics of populations, the effect of glucocorticoid responses on
   population dynamics remains essentially unstudied.

TI Life history and the ecology of stress: how do glucocorticoid hormones
   influence life-history variation in animals?
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoids hormones (GCs) are intuitively important for mediation
   of age-dependent vertebrate life-history transitions through their
   effects on ontogeny alongside underpinning variation in life-history
   traits and trade-offs in vertebrates. These concepts largely derive from
   the ability of GCs to alter energy allocation, physiology and behaviour
   that influences key life-history traits involving age-specific
   life-history transitions, reproduction and survival. Studies across
   vertebrates have shown that the neuroendocrine stress axis plays a role
   in the developmental processes that lead up to age-specific early
   life-history transitions. While environmental sensitivity of the stress
   axis allows for it to modulate the timing of these transitions within
   species, little is known as to how variation in stress axis function has
   been adapted to produce interspecific variation in the timing of
   life-history transitions. Our assessment of the literature confirms that
   of previous reviews that there is only equivocal evidence for
   correlative or direct functional relationships between GCs and variation
   in reproduction and survival. We conclude that the relationships between
   GCs and life-history traits are complex and general patterns cannot be
   easily discerned with current research approaches and experimental
   designs. We identify several future research directions including: (i)
   integration of proximate and ultimate measures, including longitudinal
   studies that measure effects of GCs on more than one life-history trait
   or in multiple environmental contexts, to test explicit hypotheses about
   how GCs and life-history variation are related and (ii) the measurement
   of additional factors that modulate the effects of GCs on life-history
   traits (e.g. GC receptors and binding protein levels) to better infer
   neurendocrine stress axis actions. Conceptual models of HPA/I axis
   actions, such as allostatic load and reactive scope, to some extent
   explicitly predict the role of GCs in a life-history context, but are
   descriptive in nature. We propose that GC effects on life-history
   transitions, survival probabilities and fecundity can be modelled in
   existing quantitative demographic frameworks to improve our
   understanding of how GC variation influences life-history evolution and
   GC-mediated effects on population dynamics

TI Dual specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9) expression is down-regulated in
   the severe pre-eclamptic placenta
SO PLACENTA
AB Objectives: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and pre-eclampsia are
   severe and clinically important manifestations of placental
   insufficiency. In the mouse, dual specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9) is
   critical to the normal development of the placenta, where knock-outs are
   growth restricted and have a placental phenotype similar to that seen in
   syndromes of human placental insufficiency. Our purpose was to
   characterize DUSP9 expression in normal human pregnancy and in cases of
   placental insufficiency.
   Study design: We used RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry and Western blotting
   to characterize DUSP9 gene expression and protein levels across human
   gestation and in pregnancies complicated by severe IUGR and/or severe
   pre-eclampsia. DUSP9 promoter methylation was studied in pathologic and
   pre-term control placentas to investigate potential epigenetic
   regulation. First trimester villous explants and BeWo cells were treated
   with DUSP9 silencing RNA to determine the effect on downstream pathways.
   Placental hypoxia is a hallmark of pre-eclampsia; therefore explants
   were subjected to hypoxic culture conditions to determine the effect of
   oxygen on DUSP9 expression in vitro.
   Results: DUSP9 expression was evident in villous trophoblast and
   declined during development. DUSP9 protein was significantly lower in
   severe pre-eclamptic placentas compared to severe growth restriction.
   This was not epigenetically mediated by promoter hyper-methylation, and
   the downstream pathway ERK1/2 was not significantly affected. DUSP9
   expression in first trimester explants was significantly decreased by 74
   +/- 20% in hypoxic (3% oxygen) culture conditions. In BeWo cells and
   explanted placental villi treated with DUSP9 silencing RNA, expression
   of DUSP9 was down-regulated by 61% and 62% respectively. There was a
   trend to increased phosphorylation of the downstream target ERK1/2 in
   DUSP9 down-regulated BeWo cells and explanted placental villi.
   Conclusion: DUSP9 protein levels were markedly suppressed in severe
   pre-eclampsia, but not in severe IUGR. This suppression might be
   attributable to the prolonged hypoxic conditions found in pre-eclampsia.

TI Epigenetics and aging
SO MATURITAS
AB Over the past two decades, a growing interest on the research of the
   biological basis of human longevity has emerged, in order to clarify the
   intricacy of biological and environmental factors affecting (together
   with stochastic factors) the quality and the rate of human aging. These
   researches have outlined a complex scenario in which epigenetic marks,
   such as DNA methylation and numerous histone modifications, are emerging
   as important factors of the overall variation in life expectancy. In
   fact, epigenetic marks, that are responsible of the establishment of
   specific expression programs and of genome stability, represent a
   "drawbridge" across genetic, environmental and stochastic factors.
   In this review we provide an overview on the current knowledge and the
   general features of the epigenetic modifications characterizing the

TI Posttranscriptional Regulation of Histone Lysine Methyltransferase GLP
   in Embryonic Male Mouse Germ Cells
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB The epigenetic status of germ cells changes dynamically during
   development. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of histone H3
   lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), a highly conserved mark of epigenetic
   silencing, and the expression of two lysine methyltransferases,
   G9a/Ehmt2/KMT1C and GLP/Ehmt1/KMT1D, in murine male embryonic germ cells
   after sex determination. Our previous studies established that G9a and
   GLP are the primary enzymes for H3K9me2 and predominantly exist as a
   G9a-GLP heteromeric complex that appears to be a functional H3K9
   methyltransferase in vivo. During the period from Embryonic Day (E) 13.5
   to E18.5 in mice, gonadal H3K9me2 levels were substantially lower in
   germ cells than in cells of nongerm lineage. Immunohistochemical
   analysis showed that during this phase in development, GLP level, but
   not G9a level, was also significantly lower in male germ cells. However,
   GLP mRNA was present in E13 and E16 male germ cells, with levels similar
   to those in cells of nongerm lineage. Interestingly, GLP is upregulated
   in embryonic male germ cells deficient for Nanos2, which encodes a germ
   cell-specific RNA-binding protein. Our data suggest that GLP protein
   expression is posttranscriptionally regulated in murine embryonic male
   germ cells after sex determination and that low H3K9me2 level results
   from the absence of GLP (severe reduction of the G9a-GLP heteromeric
   complex).

TI Apoptotic DNA Fragmentation May Be a Cooperative Activity between
   Caspase-activated Deoxyribonuclease and the Poly(ADP-ribose)
   Polymerase-regulated DNAS1L3, an Endoplasmic Reticulum-localized
   Endonuclease That Translocates to the Nucleus during Apoptosis
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is the most favorable candidate for
   chromatin degradation during apoptosis. Ca(2+)-dependent endonucleases
   are equally important in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (INDF),
   including the PARP-1-regulated DNAS1L3. Despite the elaborate work on
   these endonucleases, the question of whether these enzymes cooperate
   during INDF was not addressed. Here, we show a lack of correlation
   between INDF and CAD expression levels and inactivation by cleavage of
   its inhibitor (ICAD) during apoptosis. The cells that failed to induce
   INDF accumulated large amounts of 50-kb breaks, which is suggestive of
   incomplete chromatin processing. Similarly, INDF was blocked by Ca(2+)
   chelation without a block in ICAD cleavage or caspase-3 activation,
   which is consistent with the involvement of CAD in 50-kb DNA
   fragmentation and its Ca(2+) independence. However, DNAS1L3 expression
   in INDF-deficient cells promoted INDF during apoptosis and was blocked
   by Ca(2+) chelation. Interestingly, expression of DNAS1L3 in
   ICAD-deficient cells failed to promote tumor necrosis factor
   alpha-induced INDF but required the coexpression of ICAD. These results
   suggest a cooperative activity between CAD and DNAS1L3 to accomplish
   INDF. In HT-29 cells, endogenous DNAS1L3 localized to the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) and translocated to the nucleus upon apoptosis induction
   but prior to INDF manifestation, making it the first reported
   Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease to migrate from the ER to the nucleus. The
   nuclear accumulation of DNAS1L3, but not its exit out of the ER,
   required the activity of cysteine and serine proteases. Interestingly,
   the endonuclease accumulated in the cytosol upon inhibition of serine,
   but not cysteine, proteases. These results exemplify the complexity of
   chromatin degradation during apoptosis.

TI Colorectal Cancer Microenvironment: Among Nutrition, Gut Microbiota,
   Inflammation and Epigenetics
SO CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major health problem causing significant
   morbidity and mortality. During the last decade, results from different
   studies indicate that the pathogenetic mechanisms of CRC encompass
   tumour microenvironment, emphasizing a tight correlation with aging,
   inflammation, nutrition, gut microbiome composition and epigenetic
   modifications. Aging is one of the most important risk factors for the
   development of a wide range of neoplasies, including CRC, as it
   represents the general framework in which the tumor environment evolves.
   Together, these elements likely contribute to the carcinogenic process
   with specific effects, impacts and roles in the different stages of the
   tumor progression. CRCs evolve through loops of deregulated inflammatory
   stimuli which are sustained by DNA damage signaling pathways, dysbiosis
   of gut microbiota (GM) and epigenetic re-modelling (DNA methylation). To
   date no studies address those elements simultaneously. The synergic
   analysis of such parameters could provide new biological insights and
   effective biomarkers that could have applications in prevention,
   molecular diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of CRC.

TI TCL1A and ATM are co-expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
   without deletion of 11q
SO HAEMATOLOGICA
AB Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by the accumulation of B
   cells that are resistant to apoptosis. This resistance is induced by
   pro-survival stimuli from the microenvironment. TCL1 and ATM are central
   to the pathogenesis of the disease and associated with more aggressive
   disease. Their protein products have recently been shown to physically
   interact in leukemic cells and to impact on NF-kappa B signaling, which
   is a key regulator of apoptosis. In the present study we show that TCL1
   and ATM are significantly co-expressed and up-regulated in malignant
   cells compared to non-malignant B cells, and that expression of TCL1 is
   partially deregulated by aberrant DNA-methylation. In addition, complex
   external stimuli induce essentially similar TCL1 and ATM time-course
   kinetics. In line with a coordinative regulation of NF-kappa B signaling
   by TCL1, its knockdown induced apoptosis in primary leukemia cells.
   These findings suggest that both genes functionally cooperate to
   modulate similar apoptosis-related cellular pathways.

TI Associations between the White Sea colonial hydroid Dynamena pumila and

SO JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
AB Marine sessile invertebrates with outer skeleton constitute additional
   substrate for a diverse group of epibiotic organisms. Colonial hydroids
   are no exception. Large numbers of motile and sessile organisms use
   hydroid colonies covered with chitinous perisarc for permanent or
   temporal attachment. Such epibiotic associations between colonial
   hydroids and microorganisms are poorly studied and mostly known for
   subtropical regions. There are no data about the development of such
   epibiotic association and type of its specificity yet. The present paper
   for the first time describes the epibiotic association of the colonial
   thecate hydroid Dynamena pumila from the high latitude sea. We
   reconstruct the spatial and temporal development of such epibiotic
   community and analyse the organization of the multicomponent biofilm
   covering the hydroid colony. Comparison of the epibiotic community in
   different seasons indicates for holding out of the basal features and
   components of the community during the whole year. Ultrastructural
   investigations revealed that components of the biofilm affect the outer
   skeleton of the hydroid colony that results in penetration of the
   microorganisms into the skeleton and even soft tissues. Our data allow
   supposing that association of hydroid D. pumila with a microorganism
   community has features of a symbiotic system.

TI Access to the Nucleus and Functional Association with c-Myc Is Required
   for the Full Oncogenic Potential of Delta EGFR/EGFRvIII
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Delta EGFR is a potent glioblastoma oncogene which has been studied
   primarily as a plasma membrane kinase. Using intracranial xenograft
   studies in mice, we show that blocking Delta EGFR access to the nucleus
   attenuates its tumorigenicity and, conversely, that promoting nuclear
   accumulation enhances this, providing the first in vivo evidence that
   the nuclear actions of Delta EGFR contribute strongly to its oncogenic
   function. Nuclear actions of Delta EGFR include regulation of gene
   expression by participation in chromatin-bound complexes, and
   genome-wide mapping of these sequences by chromatin immunoprecipitation
   and massively parallel sequencing identified 2294 peaks. Bioinformatic
   analysis showed enrichment of the E-box motif in the dataset, and c-Myc
   and Delta EGFR were corecruited to the promoters of and
   transcriptionally activated a subset of nuclear Delta EGFR chromatin
   targets. Knockdown of c-Myc decreased the expression of these targets
   and diminished Delta EGFR-stimulated anchorage-independent colony
   formation. We conclude that transcriptional regulation of target genes
   by association with gene regulatory chromatin in cooperation with c-Myc
   by nuclear Delta EGFR makes a unique contribution to its oncogenicity
   and propose that this venue provides new targets for therapeutic
   intervention.

TI HOW TO MEASURE MATURATION: A COMPARISON OF PROBABILISTIC METHODS USED TO
   TEST FOR GENOTYPIC VARIATION AND PLASTICITY IN THE DECISION TO MATURE
SO EVOLUTION
AB Maturation is a developmental trait that plays a key role in shaping
   organisms life-history. However, progress in understanding how
   maturation phenotypes evolve has been held back by confusion over how
   best to model maturation decisions and a lack of studies comparing
   genotypic variation in maturation. Here, we fitted probabilistic
   maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) to data collected from five clones of
   Daphnia magna and five of Daphnia pulex collected from within and
   between different populations. We directly compared the utility of
   modeling approaches that assume maturation to be a process with an
   instantaneous rate with those that do not by fitting maturation rate and
   logistic regression models, and emphasize similarities and differences
   between them. Our results demonstrate that in Daphnia, PMRNs using a
   logistic regression approach were simpler to use and provided a better
   fit to the data. The decision to mature was plastic across a range of
   growth trajectories and dependent upon both body size and age. However,
   the age effect was stronger in D. magna than D. pulex and varied
   considerably between clones. Our results support the idea that
   maturation thresholds can evolve but also suggest that the notion of a
   threshold based on a single fixed state is an oversimplification that
   underestimates the adaptability of these important traits.

   Committee on Cancer stage III or IV). Within each risk stratum, the role
   of region and nonclinical correlates of RAI use were evaluated using
   hierarchical logistic regression.
   Main Outcome Measure: Use of RAI was measured.
   Results: Rates of RAI use varied across geographic regions from 49% to
   66%. Regional differences persisted after controlling for patient and
   hospital characteristics and evaluating less vs more intensive regions
   within low-risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]
   0.25-0.53)], medium-risk [OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.16-0.34)], and high-risk
   cancers [OR 0.30 (95% CI 0.19-0.49)]. Patterns of RAI use were similar
   in medium-and high-risk patients. The most nonclinical correlates of use
   were in low-risk patients.
   Conclusion: Similar treatment patterns for the heterogeneous medium-risk
   thyroid cancer patients compared with the high-risk patients suggest
   more intensive management in patients with medium-risk disease. The
   large number of nonclinical correlates of RAI use, including region,
   imply controversy over indications for RAI. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98:

TI Is pituitary TSH an adequate measure of thyroid hormone-controlled
   homoeostasis during thyroxine treatment?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Objective: In recognition of its primary role in pituitary-thyroid
   feedback, TSH determination has become a key parameter for clinical
   decision-making. This study examines the value of TSH as a measure of
   thyroid hormone homoeostasis under thyroxine (T(4)) therapy.
   Design and methods: We have examined the interrelationships between free
   triiodothyronine (FT(3)), free T(4) (FT(4)) and pituitary TSH by means
   of i) a retrospective analysis of a large clinical sample comprising
   1994 patients either untreated or on varying doses of L-T(4) and ii)
   independent mathematical simulation applying a model of thyroid
   homoeostasis, together with a sensitivity analysis.
   Results: Over a euthyroid to mildly hyperthyroid functional range, we
   found markedly different correlation slopes of log TSH vs FT(3) and
   FT(4) between untreated patients and L-T(4) groups. Total deiodinase
   activity (G(D)) was positively correlated with TSH in untreated
   subjects. However, G(D) was significantly altered and the correlation
   was lost under increasing L-T(4) doses. Ninety-five per cent confidence
   intervals for FT(3) and FT(4), when assessed in defined TSH
   concentration bands, differed significantly for L-T(4)-treated compared
   with untreated patients. Higher doses were often needed to restore FT(3)
   levels within its reference range. Sensitivity analysis revealed the
   influence of various structural parameters on pituitary TSH secretion
   including an important role of pituitary deiodinase type 2.
   Conclusion: The data reveal disjoints between FT(4)-TSH feedback and
   T(3) production that persist even when sufficient T(4) apparently
   restores euthyroidism. T(4) treatment displays a compensatory adaptation
   but does not completely re-enact normal euthyroid physiology. This
   invites a study of the clinical consequences of this disparity. European

TI Tumor Prognostic Factors and the Challenge of Developing Predictive
   Factors
SO CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB Histopathologic classification has been widely used to type and grade
   primary brain tumors. However, the diverse behavior of primary brain
   tumors has made prognostic determinations based purely on clinical and
   histopathologic variables difficult. Recent advances in the molecular
   genetics of brain tumors have helped to explain the witnessed
   heterogeneity regarding response to treatment, time to progression, and
   overall survival. Additionally, there has been interest in identifying
   predictive factors to help direct patients to therapeutic interventions
   specific to their tumor and patient biology. Further identification of
   both prognostic and predictive biomarkers will make possible better

TI Tetrac Can Replace Thyroid Hormone During Brain Development in Mouse
   Mutants Deficient in the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Mct8
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) plays a critical role in
   mediating the uptake of thyroid hormones (THs) into the brain. In
   patients, inactivating mutations in the MCT8 gene are associated with a
   severe form of psychomotor retardation and abnormal serum TH levels.
   Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of the TH analog
   3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) as a replacement for T(4)
   in brain development. Using COS1 cells transfected with TH transporter
   and deiodinase constructs, we could show that tetrac, albeit not being
   transported by MCT8, can be metabolized to the TH receptor active
   compound 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (triac) by type 2 deiodinase and
   inactivated by type 3 deiodinase. Triac in turn is capable of replacing
   T(3) in primary murine cerebellar cultures where it potently stimulates
   Purkinje cell development. In vivo effects of tetrac were assessed in
   congenital hypothyroid Pax8-knockout (KO) and Mct8/Pax8 double-KO mice
   as well as in Mct8-KO and wild-type animals after daily injection of
   tetrac (400 ng/g body weight) during the first postnatal weeks. This
   treatment was sufficient to promote TH-dependent neuronal
   differentiation in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum but was
   ineffective in suppressing hypothalamic TRH expression. In contrast, TSH
   transcript levels in the pituitary were strongly down-regulated in
   response to tetrac. Based on our findings we propose that tetrac
   administration offers the opportunity to provide neurons during the
   postnatal stage with a potent TH receptor agonist, thereby eventually
   reducing the neurological damage in patients with MCT8 mutations without
   deteriorating the thyrotoxic situation in peripheral tissues.

TI Pivots of pluripotency: The roles of non-coding RNA in regulating
   embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS
AB Background: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from
   reprogrammed patient somatic cells possess enormous therapeutic
   potential. However, unlocking the full capabilities of iPSC will require
   an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms which govern the
   induction and maintenance of pluripotency, as well as directed
   differentiation to clinically relevant lineages. Induced pluripotency of
   a differentiated cell is mediated by sequential cascades of genetic and
   epigenetic reprogramming of somatic histone and DNA CpG methylation
   marks. These genome-wide changes are mediated by a coordinated activity
   of transcription factors and epigenetic modifying, enzymes. Non-coding
   RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs
   (IncRNAs), are now recognized as an important third class of regulators
   of the pluripotent state.
   Scope of review: This review surveys the currently known roles and
   mechanisms of ncRNAs in regulating the embryonic and induced pluripotent
   states.
   Major conclusions: Through a variety of mechanisms, ncRNAs regulate
   constellations of key pluripotency genes and epigenetic regulators, and
   thus critically determine induction and maintenance of the pluripotent
   state.
   General significance: A further understanding of the roles of ncRNAs in
   regulating pluripotency may help assess the quality of human iPSC
   reprogramming. Additionally, ncRNA biology may help decipher potential
   transcriptional and epigenetic commonalities between the self renewal
   processes that govern both ESC and tumor initiating cancer stem cells
   (CSC). This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Biochemistry of

TI ANT2 suppression by shRNA may be able to exert anticancer effects in HCC
   further by restoring SOCS1 expression
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a negative regulator of
   Janus kinase and the signal transducer and activation of transcription
   (Jak-STAT) pathway. SOCS-1 is known to be silenced by aberrant promoter
   methylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during early
   tumorigenesis, therefore, a strategy to restore SOCS1 expression can be
   utilized for cancer therapy. Here, we examined the influence of adenine
   nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) suppression by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)
   on SOCS1 expression and its downstream effect in HCC. ANT2 shRNA
   treatment led to restoration of SOCS1 expression along with its promoter
   demethylation in Hep3B cells, which was accompanied by decreased DNA
   methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) activity through the suppression of
   Ras/PI3K/Akt signaling. Restoration of SOCS1 by ANT2 knockdown,
   subsequently, inhibited STAT3 activity and downregulated the expression
   of miR-21, which has been reported to be an important onco-miR in HCC.
   Downregulation of miR-21 efficiently suppressed Hep3B cell proliferation
   in vitro with a comparable level to ANT2 shRNA treatment. ANT2
   suppression by shRNA may be able to exert anticancer effects in HCC
   further by restoring SOCS1 expression.

TI MicroRNA-152 targets DNA methyltransferase 1 in NiS-transformed cells
   via a feedback mechanism
SO CARCINOGENESIS
AB Nickel (Ni) compounds are well-recognized human carcinogens, yet the
   molecular mechanisms by which they cause human cancer are still not well
   understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs, are
   involved in diverse biological functions and carcinogenesis. In previous
   study, we identified upregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
   expression in nickel sulfide (NiS)-transformed human bronchial
   epithelial (16HBE) cells. Here, we investigated whether some miRNAs are
   aberrantly expressed and targets DNMT1 in NiS-transformed cells. Our
   results showed that the expression of miRNA-152 (miR-152) was
   specifically downregulated in NiS-transformed cells via promoter DNA
   hypermethylation, whereas ectopic expression of miR-152 in
   NiS-transformed cells resulted in a marked reduction of DNMT1
   expression. Further experiments revealed that miR-152 directly
   downregulated DNMT1 expression by targeting the 3' untranslated regions
   of its transcript. Interestingly, treatment of DNMT inhibitor,
   5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, or depletion of DNMT1 led to increased miR-152
   expression by reversion of promoter hypermethylation, DNMT1 and MeCP2
   binding to miR-152 promoter in NiS-transformed cells. Moreover,
   inhibition of miR-152 expression in 16HBE cells could increase DNMT1
   expression and result in an increase in DNA methylation, DNMT1 and MeCP2
   binding to miR-152 promoter, indicating an interaction between miR-152
   and DNMT1 is regulated by a double-negative circuit. Furthermore,
   ectopic expression of miR-152 in NiS-transformed cells led to a
   significant decrease of cell growth. Conversely, inhibition of miR-152
   expression in 16HBE cells significantly increased cell growth. Taken
   together, these observations demonstrate a crucial functional crosstalk
   between miR-152 and the DNMT1 via a feedback loop involved in
   NiS-induced malignant transformation.

TI The comprehensive epigenome map of piRNA clusters
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters act as anti-transposon/retrovirus
   centers. Integration of selfish jumping elements into piRNA clusters
   generates de novo piRNAs, which in turn exert trans-silencing activity
   against these elements in animal gonads. To date, neither genome-wide
   chromatin modification states of piRNA clusters nor a mode for piRNA
   precursor transcription have been well understood. Here, to understand
   the chromatin landscape of piRNA clusters and how piRNA precursors are
   generated, we analyzed the transcriptome, transcription start sites
   (TSSs) and the chromatin landscape of the BmN4 cell line, which harbors
   the germ-line piRNA pathway. Notably, our epigenomic map demonstrated
   the highly euchromatic nature of unique piRNA clusters. RNA polymerase
   II was enriched for TSSs that transcribe piRNA precursors. piRNA
   precursors possessed 5'-cap structures as well as 3'-poly A-tails.
   Collectively, we envision that the euchromatic, opened nature of unique
   piRNA clusters or piRNA cluster-associated TSSs allows piRNA clusters to
   capture new insertions efficiently.

SO APMIS
AB Kim MS, Kim YR, Yoo NJ, Lee SH. Mutational analysis of DNMT3A gene in
   acute leukemias and common solid cancers. APMIS 2013; 121: 85-94.
   DNMT3A, a DNA methyltransferase that functions for de novo methylation,
   is important in development and many cellular processes related to
   tumorigenesis. Somatic mutations of DNMT3A gene, including recurrent
   mutations in its Arg-882, were recently reported in acute myelogenous
   leukemia (AML), strongly suggesting its role in development of AML. To
   see whether DNMT3A mutation occurs in other malignancies as well, we
   analyzed DNMT3A in 916 cancer tissues from 401 hematologic malignancies
   (AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), multiple myelomas and
   lymphomas) and 515 carcinomas (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal and
   gastric carcinomas) using a single-strand conformation polymorphism
   (SSCP) assay. We identified DNMT3A mutations, especially the Arg-882
   mutations, in adulthood AML (9.4%). In addition, we found DNMT3A
   mutations in pre-B-ALL and three lung cancers at lower frequencies.
   Allelic loss of DNMT3A was frequently observed in most cancer types
   analyzed, including lymphomas (48.1%), gastric cancers (23.5%) and lung
   cancers (18.3%) irrespective of DNMT3A mutation. Also, loss of DNMT3A
   expression was common in lung cancers (46.4%), and was associated with
   the allelic loss. Our data indicate that DNMT3A gene is mutated mainly
   in AML, but it occurs in other cancers, such as ALL and lung cancer,
   despite the lower incidences. Also, the data suggest that DNMT3A is
   altered in many cancer types by various ways, including somatic
   mutations, allelic loss and loss of expression that might play roles in
   tumorigenesis.

TI Gene-Environment Interactions in Major Depressive Disorder
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
AB Family, twin, and epidemiologic studies have suggested that both genes
   and environment are important risk factors for the development of major
   depressive disorder (MDD). In the absence of consistent and strong main
   genetic effects, numerous studies have supported gene-environment
   interactions in this disorder. While the impact of negative
   environmental factors, such as early life stress, traumatic experiences,
   and negative life events have been established as risk factors, they are
   not sufficient to predict MDD. This article will review evidence
   suggesting that genetic variants moderate the effects of adversities on
   the development of MDD, with a focus on the importance of careful
   characterization of the stressful life events as well as systemic and
   molecular mechanisms that potentially mediate these gene environment

TI Mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running have larger
   midbrains: support for the mosaic model of brain evolution
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Increased brain size, relative to body mass, is a primary characteristic
   distinguishing the mammalian lineage. This greater encephalization has
   come with increased behavioral complexity and, accordingly, it has been
   suggested that selection on behavioral traits has been a significant
   factor leading to the evolution of larger whole-brain mass. In addition,
   brains may evolve in a mosaic fashion, with functional components having
   some freedom to evolve independently from other components, irrespective
   of, or in addition to, changes in size of the whole brain. We tested
   whether long-term selective breeding for high voluntary wheel running in
   laboratory house mice results in changes in brain size, and whether
   those changes have occurred in a concerted or mosaic fashion. We
   measured wet and dry brain mass via dissections and brain volume with ex
   vivo magnetic resonance imaging of brains that distinguished the
   caudate-putamen, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and forebrain.
   Adjusting for body mass as a covariate, mice from the four replicate
   high-runner (HR) lines had statistically larger non-cerebellar wet and
   dry brain masses than those from four non-selected control lines, with
   no differences in cerebellum wet or dry mass or volume. Moreover, the
   midbrain volume in HR mice was similar to 13% larger (P<0.05), while
   volumes of the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum and forebrain
   did not differ statistically between HR and control lines. We
   hypothesize that the enlarged midbrain of HR mice is related to altered
   neurophysiological function in their dopaminergic system. To our
   knowledge, this is the first example in which selection for a particular
   mammalian behavior has been shown to result in a change in size of a
   specific brain region.

TI Current progress on structural studies of nucleosomes containing histone
   H3 variants
SO CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB The nucleosome is the basic repeating unit of chromatin. During the
   nucleosome assembly process, DNA is wrapped around two H3-H4 dimers,
   followed by the inclusion of two H2A-H2B dimers. The H3-H4 dimers
   provide the fundamental architecture of the nucleosome. Many non-allelic
   variants have been found for H3, but not for H4, suggesting that the
   functions of chromatin domains may, at least in part, be dictated by the
   specific H3 variant that is incorporated. A prominent example is the
   centromeric H3 variant, CENP-A, which specifies the function of
   centromeres in chromosomes. In this review, we survey the current
   progress in the studies of nucleosomes containing H3 variants, and
   discuss their implications for the architecture and dynamics of

TI Adiposity Blunts the Positive Relationship of Thyrotropin with
   Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin-Kexin Type 9 Levels in Euthyroid
   Subjects
SO THYROID
AB Background: Effects of thyroid function status on lipoprotein metabolism
   may extend into the euthyroid range. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
   metabolism is governed by proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9
   (PCSK9), which down-regulates LDL receptor expression, resulting in
   higher LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Here, we tested whether plasma PCSK9
   correlates with thyroid function in nonobese and obese euthyroid
   subjects.
   Methods: We assessed the extent to which plasma PCSK9 is determined by
   thyrotropin (TSH) in 74 euthyroid subjects (31 women; TSH between 0.5
   and 4.0mU/L and free thyroxine [FT4] between 11.0 and 19.5 pM) with
   varying degrees of obesity (body mass index [BMI] ranging from 20.2 to
   40.4 kg/m(2)).
   Results: TSH, FT4, PCSK9, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   (non-HDL-C), LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels were not
   different between 64 nonobese subjects (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) and 10 obese
   subjects (BMI >= 30 kg/m2; p > 0.20 for each). PCSK9 correlated
   positively with TSH in nonobese subjects (r = 0.285, p = 0.023). In
   contrast, PCSK9 was not associated positively with TSH in obese subjects
   (r = -0.249, p = 0.49). The relationship of PCSK9 with TSH was different
   between nonobese and obese subjects when taking age, sex, FT4, and the
   presence of anti-thyroid antibodies into account (multiple linear
   regression analysis: beta = -0.320, p = 0.012 for the interaction term
   between the presence of obesity and TSH on PCSK9), and was also modified
   by BMI as a continuous trait (beta = -0.241, p = 0.062 for the
   interaction term between BMI and TSH on PCSK9). Non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and
   apoB levels were dependent on PCSK9 in nonobese subjects (p <= 0.01 for
   each), but not in obese subjects (p > 0.50), Accordingly, BMI interacted
   negatively with PCSK9 on non-HDL-C (p = 0.028) and apoB (p = 0.071).
   Conclusions: This study suggests that circulating PCSK9 levels correlate
   with thyroid function even in the normal range. This relationship
   appears to be blunted by obesity. Thyroid functional status may
   influence cholesterol metabolism through the PCSK9 pathway.

TI Identification of Dlk1-Dio3 Imprinted Gene Cluster Noncoding RNAs as
   Novel Candidate Biomarkers for Liver Tumor Promotion
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The molecular events during nongenotoxic carcinogenesis and their
   temporal order are poorly understood but thought to include long-lasting
   perturbations of gene expression. Here, we have investigated the
   temporal sequence of molecular and pathological perturbations at early
   stages of phenobarbital (PB) mediated liver tumor promotion in vivo.
   Molecular profiling (mRNA, microRNA [miRNA], DNA methylation, and
   proteins) of mouse liver during 13 weeks of PB treatment revealed
   progressive increases in hepatic expression of long noncoding RNAs and
   miRNAs originating from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster, a locus
   that has recently been associated with stem cell pluripotency in mice
   and various neoplasms in humans. PB induction of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster
   noncoding RNA (ncRNA) Meg3 was localized to glutamine
   synthetase-positive hypertrophic perivenous hepatocytes, sug- gesting a
   role for -catenin signaling in the dysregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs.
   The carcinogenic relevance of Dlk1-Dio3 locus ncRNA induction was
   further supported by in vivo genetic dependence on constitutive
   androstane receptor and -catenin pathways. Our data identify Dlk1-Dio3
   ncRNAs as novel candidate early biomarkers for mouse liver tumor
   promotion and provide new opportunities for assessing the carcinogenic
   potential of novel compounds.

TI Epigenetic Repression of miR-31 Disrupts Androgen Receptor Homeostasis
   and Contributes to Prostate Cancer Progression
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Androgen receptor signaling plays a critical role in prostate cancer
   pathogenesis. Yet, the regulation of androgen receptor signaling remains
   elusive. Even with stringent androgen deprivation therapy, androgen
   receptor signaling persists. Here, our data suggest that there is a
   complex interaction between the expression of the tumor suppressor
   miRNA, miR-31, and androgen receptor signaling. We examined primary and
   metastatic prostate cancer and found that miR-31 expression was reduced
   as a result of promoter hypermethylation, and importantly, the levels of
   miR-31 expression were inversely correlated with the aggressiveness of
   the disease. As the expression of androgen receptor and miR-31 was
   inversely correlated in the cell lines, our study further suggested that
   miR-31 and androgen receptor could mutually repress each other.
   Upregulation of miR-31 effectively suppressed androgen receptor
   expression through multiple mechanisms and inhibited prostate cancer
   growth in vivo. Notably, we found that miR-31 targeted androgen receptor
   directly at a site located in the coding region, which was commonly
   mutated in prostate cancer. In addition, miR-31 suppressed cell-cycle
   regulators including E2F1, E2F2, EXO1, FOXM1, and MCM2. Together, our
   findings suggest a novel androgen receptor regulatory mechanism mediated
   through miR-31 expression. The downregulation of miR-31 may disrupt
   cellular homeostasis and contribute to the evolution and progression of
   prostate cancer. We provide implications for epigenetic treatment and
   support clinical development of detecting miR-31 promoter methylation as
   a novel biomarker. Cancer Res; 1-13. (c) 2012 AACR.

TI Cytotoxicity of 5-Aza-2 '-deoxycytidine against gastric cancer involves
   DNA damage in an ATM-P53 dependent signaling pathway and demethylation
   of P16(INK4A)
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB The DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) has
   increasingly attracted worldwide attention for its antineoplastic
   potential. The cytotoxitic mechanisms, however, especially, the relative
   contribution of silenced genes reactivation by demethylation and
   enzyme-DNA adduct formation to the efficacy of 5-Aza-CdR is still a
   crucial unresolved question. In this investigation, we demonstrated that
   5-Aza-CdR treatment resulted in growth suppression in a concentration
   and time-dependent manner and G2 phrase arrest - hallmarks of a DNA
   damage response in gastric cancer AGS cells. Formation of DNA
   double-strand breaks, as monitored by comet assay was examined in an ATM
   (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)-dependent manner based on the fact that
   PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin abolished the action of cytotoxicity of
   5-Aza-CdR. Upon treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, ATM activation was clearly
   associated with P53 phosphorylation at Ser(15), which was directly
   responsible for 5-Aza-CdR modified P21(Waf1/Cip1) expression. Further
   exploration revealed that demethylation of P16(INK4A) correlated with
   the strikingly down-regulated expressions of DNA methyltransferase 3A as
   well as 3B was, at least in part, attributed to the cytotoxicity of
   5-Aza-CdR in AGS cells. Conclusively, these results greatly enhance our
   understanding of the mechanisms of cytotoxicity of 5-Aza-CdR and
   strongly provide the preclinical rationale for an assessment of
   5-Aza-CdR to ameliorate patient outcome with gastric cancer. (C) 2012

TI The Peri/Postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS)
SO TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS
AB The Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS) is a longitudinal
   cohort of 250 pairs of Australian twins and their mothers, who were
   recruited mid-way through pregnancy from January 2007 to September 2009.
   The study is centered on the developmental origins of health and disease
   paradigm (DOHaD) in which an adverse intrauterine environment
   predisposes the individual to complex disease in later life by reducing
   growth in utero and adversely altering developmental plasticity. Data
   concerning diet and lifestyle were collected from mothers during
   pregnancy, and samples of plasma and serum taken at 28 weeks' gestation.
   We attended 75% of all births, at which time we collected multiple
   biological samples including placenta, cord blood, and neonatal cheek
   cells, the latter from 91% of pairs. Chorionicity was recorded and
   zygosity was determined by DNA testing where necessary. Approximately
   40% of the twins are monozygotic, two-thirds of which are dichorionic.
   Twins were seen again at 18 months of age and repeat blood and cheek
   swabs taken where possible. Studies of gene expression and the
   epigenetic marks of DNA methylation have so far revealed that twins
   exhibit a wide range of epigenetic discordance at birth, that one-third
   of the epigenome changes significantly between birth and 18 months;
   shared (maternal) environment, genetic factors, and non-shared
   intrauterine environment contribute to an increasing proportion of
   epigenetic variation at birth, respectively, and affect tissues
   differently, and that within-pair birth weight discordance correlates
   with epigenetic discordance in genes associated with lipid metabolism,
   supporting an epigenetic mechanism for DOHaD.

TI Genomics and epigenomics of renal cell carcinoma
SO SEMINARS IN CANCER BIOLOGY
AB Kidney cancer accounts for about 2% of all cancers and worldwide
   >250,000 new cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed each year. Renal cell
   carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of adult kidney cancer and this
   review describes our current knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic
   basis of sporadic RCC. Though to date major advances in understanding
   the underlying the molecular basis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have
   often been derived from studies of rare familial forms of renal cell
   carcinoma, large-scale genomic and epigenomic studies of sporadic
   tumours are beginning to provide clearer pictures of the genomic and
   epigenomic landscape of RCC and the key pathways implicated in the
   initiation and progression of the disease. Although current knowledge of
   the molecular pathogenesis of RCC is incomplete, and mostly relates to
   clear cell (conventional) RCC, the next five years will see an
   unprecedented flood of genomic and epigenomic data and the key future
   challenges will relate to the utilisation of this data to develop novel

TI Differential Gene Expression of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma Reveals
   Specific Markers Associated with Genetic Conditions
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Medullary thyroid carcinoma accounts for 2% to 5% of thyroid
   malignancies, of which 75% are sporadic and the remaining 25% are
   hereditary and related to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome.
   Despite a genotype-phenotype correlation with specific germline RET
   mutations, knowledge of pathways specifically associated with each
   mutation and with non-RET-mutated sporadic MTC remains lacking. Gene
   expression patterns have provided a tool for identifying molecular
   events related to specific tumor types and to different clinical
   features that could help identify novel therapeutic targets. Using
   transcriptional profiling of 49 frozen MTC specimens classified as RET
   mutation, we identified PROM1, LOXL2, GFRA1, and DKK4 as related to
   RET(M918T) and GAL as related to RET(634) mutation. An independent
   series of 19 frozen and 23 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) MTCs
   was used for validation by RT-qPCR. Two tissue microarrays containing 69
   MTCs were available for IHC assays. According to pathway enrichment
   analysis and gene ontology biological processes, genes associated with
   the MTC(M918T) group were involved mainly in proliferative, cell
   adhesion, and general malignant metastatic effects and with Wnt, Notch,
   NF kappa B, JAK/Stat, and MAPK signaling pathways. Assays based on
   silencing of PROM1 by siRNAs performed in the MZ-CRC-1 cell line,
   harboring RET(M918T), caused an increase in apoptotic nuclei, suggesting
   that PROM1 is necessary for survival of these cells. This is the first
   report of PROM1 overexpression among primary tumors. (Am J Pathol 2013,

TI Toward the Detection of Prostate Cancer in Urine: A Critical Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Purpose: Prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination have
   low specificity for detecting prostate cancer and they poorly predict
   the presence of aggressive disease. Urine is readily available and
   noninvasive, and it represents a promising source of biomarkers for the
   early detection and prediction of prostate cancer prognosis. We
   identified promising biomarkers for urine based prostate cancer,
   examined trends and outlined potential pitfalls.
   Materials and Methods: We performed PubMed (R) and Web of Science (R)
   database searches of the peer reviewed literature on urine based testing
   for prostate cancer. Original studies of this subject as well as a small
   number of reviews were analyzed, including the strengths and weaknesses.
   We provide a comprehensive review of urine based testing for prostate
   cancer that covers the technical aspects, including the methodology of
   urine collection, as well as recent developments in biomarkers spanning
   the fields of genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and
   metabolomics.
   Results: The process of urine collection is subject to variability,
   which may result in conflicting clinical results. Detecting prostate
   cancer in urine is technically feasible, as demonstrated by numerous
   proof of principle studies, but few markers have been validated in
   multiple large sample sets. Biomarker development using urine has been
   accelerating in recent years with numerous studies identifying DNA, RNA,
   protein and metabolite based biomarkers in urine. Advanced clinical
   studies have identified PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts as
   promising RNA markers for cancer detection and possibly prognosis. DNA
   methylation analysis of multiple genes improves specificity and
   represents a promising platform for developing clinical grade assays.
   Conclusions: Urine based testing is noninvasive and represents a rich
   source of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer. Although urine shows
   promise for detecting cancer, the ability to identify aggressive subsets
   of prostate cancer needs further development.

TI Use of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone for evaluation of

SO JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB Objective To evaluate the effects of administration of recombinant human
   (rh) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) for evaluation of thyroid
   function in euthyroid guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus).
   Design-Prospective, experimental study.
   Animals-10 healthy, sexually intact, pet guinea pigs (approx 1 year of
   age). Procedures Guinea pigs were given rhTSH (100 mu g, IM); plasma
   thyroxine concentrations were determined prior to and 3 and 4 hours
   after rhTSH injection. The animals were housed in 2 groups on the basis
   of sex and fed different commercial maintenance diets according to their
   husbandry.
   Results-There was no significant difference in thyroxine concentrations
   between males and females before or after rhTSH injection. There was
   also no difference between thyroxine concentrations at 3 versus 4 hours
   after rhTSH injection. There was a significant difference between
   thyroxine concentrations before (median, 9.05 nmol/L [0.70 mu g/dL]; 10%
   to 90% range, 7.39 to 16.99 nmol/L [0.57 to 1.32 mu g/dL]) and after
   (mean +/- SD, 23.95 +/- 4.2 nmol/L) rhTSH injection. Euthyroid guinea
   pigs had plasma thyroxine concentrations of at least 7.30 nmol/L (0.57
   mu g/dL) and an increase of at least 2.6 times prestimulation thyroxine
   concentrations at 3 or 4 hours after stimulation.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The results suggested that rhTSH
   administered IM can be used for the TSH stimulation testing in guinea
   pigs. We suggest thyroxine concentration in a euthyroid guinea pig
   should at least double 3 to 4 hours after rhTSH injection. (J Am Vet Med

TI Suppression of the let-7b microRNA pathway by DNA hypermethylation in
   infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia with MLL gene rearrangements
SO LEUKEMIA
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate cell proliferation and differentiation by
   controlling the expression of proteins involved in many signaling
   pathways. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of miRNA
   expression is associated with increased tumorigenicity and a poor
   prognosis in several types of cancers. The miRNA let-7b is one of the
   severely downregulated miRNAs in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged
   acute lynnphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. In vitro transfection of
   leukemogenic MLL fusion genes into human embryonic kidney-293 cells
   suppressed let-7b expression. In leukemic cells with an MLL fusion gene,
   the regulatory region for let-7b expression was hypermethylated, and its
   expression was partially recovered after culturing the cells with the
   demethylating agent 5-azacitidine. These results suggest that loss of
   let-7b expression may be one of the consequences of oncogenic MLL fusion
   proteins, and contributes to leukemogenesis possibly through the
   upregulation of let-7b-regulated target genes with leukemogenic
   potential in hematopoietic cells. The enforced expression of let-7b in
   ALL cell lines with an MLL fusion gene inhibited their growth,
   indicating the possible use of let-7b as a new therapeutic tool for
   refractory infant ALL with an MLL fusion gene. Leukemia (2013) 27,

TI Selective association between nucleosomes with identical DNA sequences
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Self-assembly is the autonomous organization of constituents into higher
   order structures or assemblages and is a fundamental mechanism in
   biological systems. There has been an unfounded idea that self-assembly
   may be used in the sensing and pairing of homologous chromosomes or
   chromatin, including meiotic chromosome pairing, polytene chromosome
   formation in Diptera and transvection. Recent studies proved that
   double-stranded DNA molecules have a sequence-sensing property and can
   self-assemble, which may play a role in the above phenomena. However, to
   explain these processes in terms of self-assembly, it first must be
   proved that nucleosomes retain a DNA sequence-sensing property and can
   self-assemble. Here, using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based analyses
   and a quantitative interaction assay, we show that nucleosomes with
   identical DNA sequences preferentially associate with each other in the
   presence of Mg2+ ions. Using Xenopus borealis 5S rDNA
   nucleosome-positioning sequence and 601 and 603 sequences, homomeric or
   heteromeric octa-or tetranucleosomes were reconstituted in vitro and
   induced to form weak intracondensates by MgCl2. AFM clearly showed that
   DNA sequence-based selective association occurs between nucleosomes with
   identical DNA sequences. Selective association was also detected between
   mononucleosomes. We propose that nucleosome self-assembly and DNA
   self-assembly constitute the mechanism underlying sensing and pairing of
   homologous chromosomes or chromatin.

TI Occurrence of calreticulin during the exchange of nucleohistones into
   protamine-type proteins in Chara vulgaris spermiogenesis
SO PROTOPLASMA
AB During spermiogenesis of an alga Chara vulgaris, which resembles that of
   animals, nucleohistones are replaced by protamine-type proteins. This
   exchange takes place in a spermatid nucleus during the key V
   spermiogenesis stage, in which rough endoplasmic reticulum is the site
   of protamine-type protein synthesis and is also the pathway guiding the
   proteins to their destination, nucleus. In the present work, it was
   shown that a chaperon protein, calreticulin (CRT), abundantly present at
   this significant V stage of spermiogenesis in a few cellular
   compartments, i.e., a nucleus, lumen of cisternae, and vesicles of
   significantly swollen ER as well as outside these structures, e.g., in
   Golgi apparatus, could have taken part in the process of exchange of
   nuclear proteins. Colocalization of two proteins, protamine-type
   proteins, crucial for reproduction, and CRT, was especially visible in a
   nucleus, mainly on its peripheries where condensed chromatin was
   present. Localization of protamine-type proteins and CRT in nucleus is
   in agreement with our previous results showing that protamine-type
   proteins were twofold more labelled in the peripheral area in comparison
   to the nucleus center occupied by noncondensed chromatin. The role of
   CRT in the reproduction of both plants and animals is also discussed.

   of paichongding were 87.44, 79.63, 63.31, and 52.66% of the control,

   0.09, respectively, for LC(20), LC(30), LC(40), and LC(50) paichongding
   treatments. Sublethal concentrations of paichongding showed significant

TI Cohesin, a chromatin engagement ring
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CELL BIOLOGY
AB Cohesin is a four subunit complex, conserved from yeast to man, with the
   ability to hold together two DNA segments within its ring-shaped
   structure. When the two segments belong to sister chromatids, cohesin is
   mediating cohesion, which is essential for chromosome segregation in
   mitosis and meiosis and for homologous DNA repair. When the two DNA
   segments are in the same chromatid, a loop is formed. These chromatin
   loops are emerging as a mechanism for controlling the communication
   between enhancers and promoters and thereby regulate gene expression.
   They also facilitate DNA replication and recombination. Given all its
   essential functions, it is not surprising that mutations in cohesin and
   its interacting factors have been associated to cancer and developmental
   syndromes known as cohesinopathies.

TI New molecular markers for the evaluation of gamete quality
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB Only 30 % of IVF cycles result in a pregnancy, so that multiple embryos
   need to be replaced, per treatment cycle, to increase pregnancy rates,
   resulting in a multiple gestation rate of 25 %. The use of new markers
   in the gamete selection, could reduce the number of the oocytes to be
   fertilized and embryos to be produced, but the tools to evidence the
   gamete competence remain unavailable and more studies are needed to
   identify bio-markers to select the best oocyte and sperm to produce
   embryos with higher implantation potentiality.
   To define oocyte competence, the apoptosis of the surrounding cumulus
   cells and the oxygen consumption rates for individual oocytes before
   fertilization seems to provide a non-invasive marker of oocyte
   competence and hence a quantitative assessment of the reproductive
   potential for the oocyte. The chromatin integrity seems to be used also
   as biological marker of sperm competence, together with the
   morphological evaluation of large vacuoles in the head.
   The apoptosis rate of cumulus cells lower than 25 % and an higher oxygen
   consumption could be an evidence of an overall metabolic activity,
   related to a better fertilization ability and embryo cleavage quality.
   The apoptosis rate of the sperm chromatin, evaluated by direct Tunel in
   situ analysis, seems to be, also for the male gamete, a marker of
   competence and implantation potentiality, in particular when it is lower
   than 20 %. The evaluation of the presence of large vacuoles in the sperm
   head prior to perform ICSI seems to increase the implantation rate, but
   it is not associated to chromatin integrity.
   The biological concept of competence appears unrelated to any
   morphological parameters, so that it is necessary to investigate new
   molecular markers in the gamete selection. Apoptosis of cumulus cells in
   the oocytes and spermatozoa, revealing the presence of large vacuoles,
   could help to determine the competence of the gamete to be fertilize.

TI Palytoxin causes nonoxidative necrotic damage to PC12 cells in culture
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY
AB Palytoxin (PTX) is a potent marine toxin that causies serious damage to
   various tissues and organs. It has been reported to affect the transport
   of cations across the plasma membranes, which is commonly recognized as
   being the principal mechanism of its highly toxic action on mammals,
   including humans. However, although some marine toxins have been shown
   to cause toxic effects on the nervous system by interfering with the
   transmission of nerve impulses, the effect of PTX on neuronal cells has
   not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, the toxic action of PTX on
   PC12 cells was examined as an in vitro model experiment to elucidate the
   neurotoxic properties of this toxin, and PTX was shown to reduce the
   viability of PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The
   cytotoxic action of PTX was not significantly altered by the presence of
   the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and reduced-form glutathione in the
   cultures. Fluorescence staining of the cells and the electrophoretic
   analysis of genomic DNA showed that PTX failed to cause chromatin
   condensation and DNA fragmentation within the cells. On the other hand,
   the exposure to PTX caused positive staining of the cytoplasmic space of
   the cells with propidium iodide and the release of lactate dehydrogenase
   into the culture medium. Based on these observations, PTX is considered
   to cause cell death as a consequence of disrupting the plasma membranes,
   thus causing nonoxidative necrotic damage to PC12 cells. Copyright (C)

TI Biological embedding in mental health: An epigenomic perspective
SO BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY-BIOCHIMIE ET BIOLOGIE CELLULAIRE
AB Human epidemiological studies and studies of animal models provide many
   examples by which early life experiences influence health in a long-term
   manner, a concept known as biological embedding. Such experiences can
   have profound impacts during periods of high plasticity in prenatal and
   early postnatal life. Epigenetic mechanisms influence gene function in
   the absence of changes in gene sequence. In contrast to the relative
   stability of gene sequences, epigenetic mechanisms appear, at least to
   some extent, responsive to environmental signals. To date, a few
   examples appear to clearly link early social experiences to epigenetic
   changes in pathways relevant for mental health in adulthood. Our recent
   work using high-throughput epigenomic techniques points to large-scale
   changes in gene pathways in addition to candidate genes involved in the
   response to psychosocial stress and neuroplasticity. Elucidation of
   which pathways are epigenetically labile under what conditions will
   enable a more complete understanding of how the epigenome can mediate
   environmental interactions with the genome that are relevant for mental
   health. In this mini-review, we provide examples of nascent research
   into the influence of early life experience on mental health outcomes,
   discuss evidence of epigenetic mechanisms that may underlie these
   effects, and describe challenges for research in this area.

TI Glucan of a somatic hybrid mushroom, pfls 1h: structural
   characterization and study of immunological activities
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB A water-soluble glucan (PS-I) was isolated from the aqueous extract of
   the fruit bodies of a hybrid mushroom, pfls 1h of Pleurotus florida and
   Lentinus squarrosulus (Mont.) Singer. Structural characterization of
   PS-I was carried out using total hydrolysis, methylation analysis,
   periodate oxidation, and NMR experiments ((1)H, (13)C, DEPT-135,
   DQF-COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC). Methylation analysis
   revealed that PS-I was composed of (1 -> 3, 6), (1 -> 3), (1 ->
   6)-linked and terminal beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues in a relative
   proportion of approximately 1:1:1:1. The repeating unit of the glucan
   consists of a backbone chain of two (1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl
   residues, one of which is branched at O-3 position with (1 ->
   3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and terminated with a beta-D-glucopyranosyl
   residue. Study of immunological activity revealed that PS-I stimulates
   the splenocytes, thymocytes and macrophages. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

TI Determining the adaptive potential of maternal stress
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB Ecological and medical researchers are investing great effort to
   determine the role of Maternally-Derived Stress (MDS) as an inducer of
   phenotypic plasticity in offspring. Many researchers have interpreted
   phenotypic responses as unavoidable negative outcomes (e.g., small birth
   weight, high anxiety); however, a biased underestimate of the adaptive
   potential of MDS-induced effects is possible if they are not viewed
   within an ecologically relevant or a life-history optimization
   framework. We review the ecological and environmental drivers of MDS,
   how MDS signals are transferred to offspring, and what responses MDS
   induces. Results from four free-living vertebrate systems reveals that
   although MDS induces seemingly negative investment trade-offs in
   offspring, these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better
   match the offspring to future environments; however, responses can prove
   maladaptive if they unreliably predict (i.e., are mismatched to) future
   environments. Furthermore, MDS-induced adjustments that may prove
   maladaptive for individual offspring can still prove adaptive to mothers
   by reducing current reproductive investment, and benefitting lifetime
   reproductive success. We suggest that to properly determine the adaptive
   potential of MDS, researchers must take a broader integrated
   life-history perspective, appreciate both the immediate and longer term
   environmental context, and examine lifetime offspring and maternal
   fitness.

TI On-target JAK2/STAT3 inhibition slows disease progression in orthotopic
   xenografts of human glioblastoma brain tumor stem cells
SO NEURO-ONCOLOGY
AB Background. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by an
   aggressive clinical course, therapeutic resistance, and striking
   molecular heterogeneity. GBM-derived brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs)
   closely model this molecular heterogeneity and likely have a key role in
   tumor recurrence and therapeutic resistance. Emerging evidence indicates
   that Janus kinase (JAK)2/signal transducer and activator of
   transcription (STAT)3 is an important mediator of tumor cell survival,
   growth, and invasion in a large group of GBM. Here, we used a large set
   of molecularly heterogeneous BTSCs to evaluate the translational
   potential of JAK2/STAT3 therapeutics.
   Methods. BTSCs were cultured from GBM patients and MGMT promoter
   methylation, and the mutation statuses of EGFR, PTEN, and TP53 were
   determined. Endogenous JAK2/STAT3 activity. was assessed in human GBM
   tissue, BTSCs, and orthotopic xenografts by immunohistochemistry and
   Western blotting. STAT3 short hairpin (sh)RNA, cucurbitacin-I, and
   WP1066 were used to inhibit JAK2/STAT3 activity in vitro and in vivo.
   Results. The JAK2/STAT3 pathway was demonstrated to be highly activated
   in human GBM, molecularly heterogeneous BTSCs derived from these tumors,
   and BTSC xenografts. STAT3 shRNA knockdown or cucurbitacin-I and WP1066
   administration resulted in on-target JAK2/STAT3 inhibition and
   dramatically reduced BTSC survival regardless of endogenous MGMT
   promoter methylation or EGFR, PTEN, and TPS3 mutational status. BTSC
   orthotopic xenografts maintained the high levels of activated JAK2/STAT3
   seen in their parent human tumors. Intraperitoneal WP1066 reduced
   intratumoral JAK2/STAT3 activity and prolonged animal survival.
   Conclusion. Our study demonstrates the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of
   on-target JAK2/STAT3 inhibition in heterogeneous BTSC lines that closely
   emulate the genomic and tumorigenic characteristics of human GBM.

TI Putting CENP-A in its place
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB The centromere is the chromosomal region that directs kinetochore
   assembly during mitosis in order to facilitate the faithful segregation
   of sister chromatids. The location of the human centromere is
   epigenetically specified. The presence of nucleosomes that contain the
   histone H3 variant, CENP-A, are thought to be the epigenetic mark that
   indicates active centromeres. Maintenance of centromeric identity
   requires the deposition of new CENP-A nucleosomes with each cell cycle.
   During S-phase, existing CENP-A nucleosomes are divided among the
   daughter chromosomes, while new CENP-A nucleosomes are deposited during
   early G1. The specific assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres
   requires the Mis18 complex, which recruits the CENP-A assembly factor,
   HJURP. We will review the unique features of centromeric chromatin as
   well as the mechanism of CENP-A nucleosome deposition. We will also
   highlight a few recent discoveries that begin to elucidate the factors
   that temporally and spatially control CENP-A deposition.

TI Epiphora After Radioactive Iodine Ablation for Thyroid Cancer
SO THYROID
AB Background: Epiphora is a condition in which an overflow of tears occurs
   because of excessive lacrimal secretion or insufficient drainage of
   tears due to obstruction of the nasolacrimal system. This ophthalmic
   complication can be an intermediate to late sequela of radioactive
   iodine ((131)I) therapy in thyroid cancer patients.
   Patient Findings: We present a case of a 23-year-old woman with
   complaints of bilateral excessive tearing 6 months after (131)I therapy
   for well-differentiated thyroid cancer. She was diagnosed with epiphora
   secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NDO) and had bilateral
   endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy, which resulted in complete resolution
   of her symptoms.
   Summary: The sodium iodide symporter, present in cells of the lacrimal
   drainage system, is the potential mechanism by which (131)I therapy can
   cause inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimate obstruction of tear outflow.
   Risk factors such as (131)I dose, female sex, older age, and anatomical
   variations may also play a role in the obstruction. However, the precise
   pathophysiologic mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
   Conclusions: NDO is an under-recognized complication of (131)I therapy
   in thyroid cancer patients. Questions regarding eye symptoms should be
   an integral part of clinical follow-up in management of such patients so
   that effective intervention may be performed.

TI Expression profiles of cortisol-inactivating enzyme, 11-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase-2, in human epidermal tumors and its role in keratinocyte
   proliferation
SO EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
AB The enzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) catalyzes the
   interconversion between hormonally active cortisol and inactive
   cortisone within cells. There are two isozymes: 11-HSD1 activates
   cortisol from cortisone and 11-HSD2 inactivates cortisol to cortisone.
   11-HSD1 was recently discovered in skin, and we subsequently found that
   the enzyme negatively regulates keratinocyte proliferation. We verified
   11-HSD1 and 11-HSD2 expression in benign and malignant skin tumors and
   investigated the role of 11-HSD in skin tumor pathogenesis. Randomly
   selected formalin-fixed sections of skin lesions of seborrheic keratosis
   (SK), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were
   stained with 11-HSD1 and 11-HSD2 antibodies, and 11-HSD expression was
   also evaluated in murine epidermis in which hyperproliferation was
   induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA). We observed that
   11-HSD1 expression was decreased in all SK, SCC, and BCC lesions
   compared with unaffected skin. Conversely, 11-HSD2 expression was
   increased in SK and BCC but not in SCC. Overexpression of 11-HSD2 in
   keratinocytes increased cell proliferation. In the murine model, 11-HSD1
   expression was decreased in TPA-treated hyperproliferative skin. Our
   findings suggest that 11-HSD1 expression is decreased in keratinocyte
   proliferative conditions, and 11-HSD2 expression is increased in basal
   cell proliferating conditions, such as BCC and SK. Assessing 11-HSD1 and
   11-HSD2 expression could be a useful tool for diagnosing and
   characterizing skin tumors.

TI Association study of molecular polymorphisms in candidate genes related
   to stress responses with production and meat quality traits in pigs
SO DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis exerts a large range of
   effects on metabolism, the immune system, inflammatory processes, and
   brain functions. Together with the sympathetic nervous system, it is
   also the most important stress-responsive neuroendocrine system. Both
   systems influence production traits, carcass composition, and meat
   quality. The HPA axis may be a critical target for genetic selection of
   more robust animals. Indeed, numerous studies in various species have
   demonstrated the importance of genetic factors in shaping the individual
   HPA axis phenotype, and genetic polymorphism can be found at each level
   of the axis, including hormone production by the adrenal cortices under
   stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), hormone
   bioavailability, or receptor and postreceptor mechanisms. The aim of the
   present experiment was to extend these findings to the brain
   neurochemical systems involved in stress responses. To this end, a
   number of candidate genes were sequenced for molecular polymorphisms and
   their association was studied with stress neuroendocrine and production
   traits in a genetically diverse population consisting of 100 female pigs
   from an advanced intercross (F10-F12) between 2 highly divergent breeds,
   Large White (LW) and Meishan (MS). The LW breed has a high production
   potential for lean meat and a low HPA axis activity, and the MS breed
   has low growth rate, fat carcasses-but large litters of highly viable
   piglets-and a high HPA axis activity. Candidate genes were chosen in the
   catecholaminergic and serotonergic pathways, in the pituitary control of
   cortisol production, among genes previously demonstrated to be
   differentially expressed in ACTH-stimulated adrenal glands from LW and
   MS pigs, and in cortisol receptors. Sixty new polymorphisms were found.
   The association study with carcass and meat quality traits and with
   endocrine traits showed a number of significant results, such as
   monoamine oxidase (MAOA) polymorphisms with growth rate (P = 0.01); lean
   content and intramuscular fat (P < 0.01), which are the most important
   traits for carcass value; dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) with carcass
   composition (P < 0.05); and vasopressin receptor 1B (AVPR1B) with meat
   quality traits (P <= 0.05). The effect of these polymorphisms on
   neuroendocrine parameters (eg DRD3 and HPA axis or A VPRIB and
   catecholamines) indicates information regarding their biological
   mechanism of action. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Nuclear Import of Chromatin Remodeler Isw1 Is Mediated by Atypical
   Bipartite cNLS and Classical Import Pathway
SO TRAFFIC
AB The protein Isw1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an imitation-switch
   chromatin-remodeling factor. We studied the mechanisms of its nuclear
   import and found that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) mediating
   the transport of Isw1 into the nucleus is located at the end of the
   C-terminus of the protein (aa10791105). We show that it is an atypical
   bipartite signal with an unconventional linker of 19 aa (KRIR X19 KKAK)
   and the only nuclear targeting signal within the Isw1 molecule. The
   efficiency of Isw1 nuclear import was found to be modulated by changes
   to the amino acid composition in the vicinity of the KRIR motif, but not
   by the linker length. Live-cell imaging of various karyopherin mutants
   and in vitro binding assays of Isw1NLS to importin-a revealed that the
   nuclear translocation of Isw1 is mediated by the classical import
   pathway. Analogous motifs to Isw1NLS are highly conserved in Isw1
   homologues of other yeast species, and putative bipartite cNLS were
   identified in silico at the end of the C-termini of imitation switch
   (ISWI) proteins from higher eukaryotes. We suggest that the C-termini of
   the ISWI family proteins play an important role in their nuclear import.

TI Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in hypothyroidism and
   hyperthyroxinaemia
SO THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS
AB Endocrine disorders affect both the coagulation and fibrinolytic
   systems, and have been associated with the development of cardiovascular
   diseases. Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a link
   between coagulation and the fibrinolytic system. The aim of this study
   was to determine the effect of thyroid hormone excess and deficiency on
   TAFI levels and function. The effect of hyperthyroxinemia on TAFI was
   studied in healthy volunteers who were randomised to receive
   levothyroxine or no medication for 14 days in a crossover design. The
   effect of hypothyroidism on TAFI was studied in a multicentre
   observational cohort study. Blood was drawn before treatment of patients
   with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism and when euthyroidism was achieved.
   Plasma clot-lysis times, activated TAFI (TAFIa)-dependent prolongation
   of clot-lysis and TAFI levels were measured. Thyroid hormone excess
   resulted in a hypofibrinolytic condition and in an enhanced
   TAFIa-dependent prolongation of clot lysis. A trend towards decreased
   plasma TAFI levels was observed in healthy volunteers who used
   levothyroxine. Hypothyroidism resulted in hyperfibrinolysis and a
   reduced TAFIa-dependent prolongation of clot lysis. In conclusion,
   alterations of TAFIa-dependent prolongation of clot lysis in patients
   with thyroid disorders may cause an impaired haemostatic balance. The
   disturbed haemostatic balance in patients with hyperthyroidism might
   make them prone to thrombosis, while the risk for bleeding may increase
   in patients with hypothyroidism.

   (roughly two-fold) OC levels were uncovered in the liver of this
   long-lived fulmarine petrel breeding in the Faroe Islands relative to
   Svalbard and Nunavut. Liver levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and non-ortho PCBs in
   Faroe Islands fulmars were amongst the highest reported thus far in any
   seabirds from the northern regions. Positive correlations were depicted
   in combined fulmars (all three populations) between hepatic EROD
   activity and concentrations of OCs, in which strongest associations were
   found for dioxin-like compound (PCDFs and PCDDs) and TEQ concentrations.
   Moreover, modetate to strong positive correlations were found between
   liver OC concentrations and plasma total thyroxin (TT(4)) levels and
   TT(4)/total triiodothyronine (TT(3)) level ratios, as well as strong
   negative correlations between the same suite of OCs and plasma TT(3)
   levels. Hepatic DC concentrations (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, HCB, p,p'-DDE and
   oxychlordane) also were positively correlated with hepatic retinyl
   palmitate levels which, in turn, were associated with a significant
   decrease in plasma retinol levels and somewhat unchanged liver retinol
   levels. The present meta-analysis investigation on northern fulmar
   breeding in three geographically-distant sites illustrated that DC
   exposure (mainly PCBs and dioxins/furans) may be associated with
   modulation of the thyroid and retinoid homeostasis. However, the impact
   of confounding environmental factors (e.g., temperature and nutritional
   status) on current physiological variable variations could not be ruled
   out, and thus any cause-effect linkages between thyroid and retinoid
   system perturbation and DC exposure cannot be ascertained. (c) 2012

TI Unique Features of the Anti-parallel, Heterodimeric Coiled-coil
   Interaction between Methyl-cytosine Binding Domain 2 (MBD2) Homologues
   and GATA Zinc Finger Domain Containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66 alpha)
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The methyl-cytosine binding domain 2 (MBD2)-nucleosome remodeling and
   deacetylase (NuRD) complex recognizes methylated DNA and silences
   expression of associated genes through histone deacetylase and
   nucleosome remodeling functions. Our previous structural work
   demonstrated that a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and GATA zinc
   finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66 alpha) proteins recruits the
   chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD4/Mi2 beta) to the NuRD
   complex and is necessary for MBD2-mediated DNA methylation-dependent
   gene silencing in vivo (Gnanapragasam, M. N., Scarsdale, J. N., Amaya,
   M. L., Webb, H. D., Desai, M. A., Walavalkar, N. M., Wang, S. Z., Zu
   Zhu, S., Ginder, G. D., and Williams, D. C., Jr. (2011) p66 alpha-MBD2
   coiled-coil interaction and recruitment of Mi-2 are critical for globin
   gene silencing by the MBD2-NuRD complex. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
   108, 7487-7492). The p66 alpha-MBD2 interaction differs from most
   coiled-coils studied to date by forming an anti-parallel heterodimeric
   complex between two peptides that are largely monomeric in isolation. To
   further characterize unique features of this complex that drive
   heterodimeric specificity and high affinity binding, we carried out
   biophysical analyses of MBD2 and the related homologues MBD3, MBD3-like
   protein 1 (MBD3L1), and MBD3-like protein 2 (MBD3L2) as well as specific
   mutations that modify charge-charge interactions and helical propensity
   of the coiled-coil domains. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses show
   that the individual peptides remain monomeric in isolation even at 300
   mu M in concentration for MBD2. Circular dichroism analyses demonstrate
   a direct correlation between helical content of the coiled-coil domains
   in isolation and binding affinity for p66 alpha. Furthermore,
   complementary electrostatic surface potentials and inherent helical
   content of each peptide are necessary to maintain high-affinity
   association. These factors lead to a binding affinity hierarchy of p66
   alpha for the different MBD2 homologues (MBD2 approximate to MBD3 >
   MBD3L1 approximate to MBD3L2) and suggest a hierarchical regulatory
   model in tissue and life cycle stage-specific silencing by NuRD
   complexes.

TI Epigenetics and Early Life Origins of Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases
SO JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB In light of the increasing threats of chronic noncommunicable diseases
   in developing countries, the growing recognition of the early life
   origins of chronic disease, and innovative breakthroughs in biomedical
   research and technology, it is imperative that we harness cutting-edge
   data to improve health promotion and maintenance. It is well recognized
   that chronic diseases are complex traits affected by a wide range of
   environmental and genetic factors; however, the role of epigenetic
   factors, particularly with regard to early life origins, remains largely
   unexplored. Given the unique properties of the epigenome-functionality
   during critical time windows, such as the intrauterine period,
   heritability, and reversibility-enhancing our understanding of
   epigenetic mechanisms may offer new opportunities for the development of
   novel early prediction and prevention paradigms. This may present an
   unparalleled opportunity to offer maternal and child health
   professionals important tools with the translational value to predict,
   detect, and prevent disease at an early age, long before its clinical
   occurrence, and as such, break lifelong and transgenerational cycles of
   disease. In doing so, modern technology can be leveraged to make great
   contributions to population health, quality of life, and reducing the
   burdensome economic costs of noncommunicable diseases in developing

TI Transposon Variants and Their Effects on Gene Expression in Arabidopsis
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Transposable elements (TEs) make up the majority of many plant genomes.
   Their transcription and transposition is controlled through siRNAs and
   epigenetic marks including DNA methylation. To dissect the interplay of
   siRNA-mediated regulation and TE evolution, and to examine how TE
   differences affect nearby gene expression, we investigated genome-wide
   differences in TEs, siRNAs, and gene expression among three Arabidopsis
   thaliana accessions. Both TE sequence polymorphisms and presence of
   linked TEs are positively correlated with intraspecific variation in
   gene expression. The expression of genes within 2 kb of conserved TEs is
   more stable than that of genes next to variant TEs harboring sequence
   polymorphisms. Polymorphism levels of TEs and closely linked adjacent
   genes are positively correlated as well. We also investigated the
   distribution of 24-nt-long siRNAs, which mediate TE repression. TEs
   targeted by uniquely mapping siRNAs are on average farther from coding
   genes, apparently because they more strongly suppress expression of
   adjacent genes. Furthermore, siRNAs, and especially uniquely mapping
   siRNAs, are enriched in TE regions missing in other accessions. Thus,
   targeting by uniquely mapping siRNAs appears to promote sequence
   deletions in TEs. Overall, our work indicates that siRNA-targeting of
   TEs may influence removal of sequences from the genome and hence
   evolution of gene expression in plants.

TI Maternal and Umbilical Cord Levels of T-4, FT4, TSH, TPOAb, and TgAb in
   Term Infants and Neurodevelopmental Outcome at 5.5 Years
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Relatively little is known in euthyroid populations about the
   changes in maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy, the nature of the
   relationship to cord thyroid hormone levels, and subsequent infant
   neurodevelopment.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to describe the relationship
   between maternal and cord thyroid hormone parameters and to describe
   their associations with neurodevelopment at 5.5 years.
   Design: We conducted a follow-up of women and their children born at or
   over 37 weeks' gestation.
   Main Outcomes: We measured maternal levels of TSH, thyroid peroxidase
   antibody (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), T-4, and free T-4 (FT4)
   at 10 and 34 weeks and at delivery, and cord levels of T-4, FT4, TPOAb,
   and TgAb. The association of cord thyroid hormone parameters with
   McCarthy scale scores adjusted for the major confounders of
   neurodevelopment.
   Results: Fifteen percent of the women were TPOAb-positive, and 12% were
   TgAb-positive; the proportion of women with mildly elevated TSH levels
   increased during pregnancy with the maximum (14%) at delivery. Lower
   perceptual performance and motor scores were found with TgAb-positive
   women and lower perceptual performance scores with TgAb-positive cord
   levels; otherwise, unadjusted maternal levels of TPOAb, TgAb, and TSH
   and unadjusted cord levels of FT4, TPOAb, and TgAb were not associated
   with neurodevelopment at 5.5 years. Low cord T-4 levels were associated
   with significant increments in four McCarthy scales: General Cognitive
   Index, Verbal, Quantitative, and Memory scales-increments that persisted
   after adjustment at 11.4, 7.8, 7.6, and 7.8 points, respectively.
   Conclusions: Lower levels of cord T-4 were associated with increments in
   the McCarthy scales in the domains that tested cognitive and verbal
   abilities at 5.5 years. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 829-838, 2013)

TI Ecological processes and the ecology of stress: the impacts of abiotic
   environmental factors
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Rapid, effective and enduring responses of physiology and behaviour to
   perturbations of the environment are key to robustness of an organism
   (ability to resist perturbations) and resilience (ability to resist and
   recover quickly from perturbations) so that the normal life cycle can be
   resumed quickly. Perturbations of the environment can be labile (i.e.
   eventually subside) or permanent such as when human activity changes the
   environment in the long term, for example, deforestation, urbanization,
   etc. Hormonal responses to labile perturbation factors (LPFs) allow
   organisms to cope during the perturbation and then return to the normal
   life cycle. These hormonal responses are called stress responses
   especially in cases when major changes in physiology and behaviour occur
   (emergency life-history stage). Permanent perturbations require more
   than just temporary acclimation resulting in changes in range,
   adaptation or in some cases local extinction. Perturbations can be
   abiotic, biotic and social, but these are not mutually exclusive. Here I
   focus on the effects of abiotic perturbation factors and their effects
   on the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal/interrenal axis in vertebrates.
   There is a great need for more field investigations of responses of
   free-living populations to perturbations of the environment, especially
   now that it appears the frequency and intensity of these events is
   increasing. However, such studies will require a high degree of
   opportunism on the part of the investigators to take advantage of
   unpredictable events when they occur.

TI Aqp2-Expressing Cells Give Rise to Renal Intercalated Cells
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
AB The mammalian collecting duct comprises principal and intercalated
   cells, which maintain sodium/water and acid/base balance, respectively,
   but the epigenetic contributors to the differentiation of these cell
   types remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether the histone H3 K79
   methyltransferase Dot1l, which is highly expressed in principal cells,
   participates in this process. Taking advantage of the distribution of
   aquaporin 2 (Aqp2), which localizes to principal cells of the collecting
   duct, we developed mice lacking Dot1l in Aqp2-expressing cells
   (Dot1l(AC)) and found that these mice had approximately 20% fewer
   principal cells and 13%-16% more intercalated cells than control mice.
   This deletion of Dot1l in principal cells abolished histone H3 K79
   methylation in these cells, but unexpectedly, most intercalated cells
   also had undetectable di-methyl K79, suggesting that Aqp2 cells give
   rise to intercalated cells. These Aqp2(+) cell-derived intercalated
   cells were present in both developing and mature kidneys. Furthermore,
   compared with control mice, Dot1l(AC) mice had 40% higher urine volume
   and 18% lower urine osmolarity with relatively normal electrolyte and
   acid-base homeostasis. In conclusion, these data suggest that Dot1l
   deletion facilitates the differentiation of some alpha- and
   beta-intercalated cells from Aqp2-expressing progenitor cells or mature
   principal cells. J Am Soc Nephrol 24: 243-252, 2013. doi:

TI Alleviative effects of resveratrol on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
   are associated with up regulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein
   receptor and scavenger receptor class B type I gene expressions in rats
SO FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB Lipid metabolic disorders are widely considered to be one of the most
   critical and basic link in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver
   disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to illustrate the alleviation
   function of resveratrol (Res) on NAFLD and the roles of hepatic fatty
   acid synthase (FAS), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), scavenger
   receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and thyroid hormone receptor beta 1 (TR
   beta 1), which are the key molecules involved in lipid metabolism. Adult
   male Wistar rats were fed a normal diet or high fat/sucrose diet (HFS)
   with or without resveratrol for 13 weeks. HFS induced NAFLD formation
   and increased the lipids concentrations in serum and livers of rats,
   while noticeable improvement has been reached by Res intervention.
   Moreover, Res protected against HFS-induced decrease in hepatic LDLr and
   SR-BI mRNA and protein expressions, whereas TR beta 1 expressions were
   impervious with/without Res. Unexpectedly, hepatic FAS gene expressions
   were markedly diminished in NAFLD rats and were gradually increased by
   treatment with Res. These data indicate that the alleviative effects of
   Res on NAFLD are associated with up regulation of hepatic LDLr and SR-BI
   gene expressions, which provide new insights into the pharmacological
   targets of Res in the prevention of NAFLD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Inhibition of H3K9 methyltransferases G9a/GLP prevents ototoxicity and
   ongoing hair cell death
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is one of the most common sensory
   defects in humans. Hair cells are vulnerable to various ototoxic
   insults. Effective prevention of hair cell loss remains an unmet medical
   need. Apoptotic hair cell death, which involves active regulation of
   transcription, accounts for the majority of aminoglycoside-induced hair
   cells loss. As one of the important epigenetic covalent modifications,
   histone methylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression,
   development and reaction to injury. In particular, H3K9 dimethylation
   (H3K9me2) is critical for euchromatin gene silencing. In the present
   study, we examined the roles of two highly homologous histone
   methyltransfereases responsible for this modification, G9a/G9a-like
   protein (GLP), in the reaction to aminoglycoside-induced hair cell
   damage. We observed a rapid increase of H3K9me2 upon hair cell damage in
   organotypic cochlear cultures. Treatment with the G9a/GLP-specific
   inhibitors, BIX01294 or UNC0638, reduced the level of H3K9me2 and
   prevented hair cells from death. Local delivery of BIX01294 also
   prevented neomycin-induced in vivo auditory hair cell loss in the organ
   of Corti in a mouse damage model. It is unlikely that BIX01294 functions
   through blocking aminoglycoside absorption as it does not interfere with
   aminoglycoside uptaking by hair cells in the organotypic cochlear
   cultures. Our data revealed a novel role of histone methylation in
   otoprotection, which is of potential therapeutic value for SNHL
   management. Cell Death and Disease (2013) 4, e506;

TI ISWI and CHD Chromatin Remodelers Bind Promoters but Act in Gene Bodies
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers influence genetic processes by
   altering nucleosome occupancy, positioning, and composition. In vitro,
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae ISWI and CHD remodelers require similar to
   30-85 bp of extranucleosomal DNA to reposition nucleosomes, but linker
   DNA in S. cerevisiae averages <20 bp. To address this discrepancy
   between in vitro and in vivo observations, we have mapped the genomic
   distributions of the yeast Isw1, Isw2, and Chd1 remodelers at base-pair
   resolution on native chromatin. Although these remodelers act in gene
   bodies, we find that they are also highly enriched at
   nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs), where they bind to extended regions
   of DNA adjacent to particular transcription factors. Surprisingly,
   catalytically inactive remodelers show similar binding patterns. We find
   that remodeler occupancy at NDRs and gene bodies is associated with
   nucleosome turnover and transcriptional elongation rate, suggesting that
   remodelers act on regions of transient nucleosome unwrapping or
   depletion within gene bodies subsequent to transcriptional elongation.

TI Protein kinase c alpha is involved in impaired perinatal hypothyroid rat
   brain development
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB Protein kinase Ca (PKCa) has been implicated in the regulation of a
   variety of cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentiation,
   and apoptosis, in response to a diverse range of stimuli. Activated PKCa
   mediates oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory reaction. Thyroid
   hormone (TH) is essential for the proper development of the mammalian
   central nervous system. TH deficiency during critical periods of brain
   development results in permanent cognitive and neurological impairments.
   In the present study, we attempted to explore whether PKCa is involved
   in impaired brain function in developing hypothyroid rat brain. Severe
   perinatal hypothyroidism was obtained by administration of 30 mg/day
   propylthiouracil to dams. Brain PKC activity in hypothyroid pups was
   increased significantly in cytosol and membrane fractions. The change of
   membrane PKC activity was more marked than that of cytosol, and
   hypothyroidism led to a higher ratio of membrane PKC activity to that in
   cytosol, which means abnormal activation of PKC in developing
   hypothyroid rat brain. Thyroxine replacement partially corrected these
   changes. After being treated with bisindolmaleimide XI, a mainly
   selective inhibitor for PKCa, the hypothyroid pups showed improved place
   navigation test results, and further Western blot analysis showed that
   PKCa expression in cytosol fractions was increased in hypothyroid rat
   brain with or without bisindolmaleimide XI treatment, but, after
   treatment with bisindolmaleimide XI, PKCa content in membrane fractions
   decreased almost to normal. Therefore, we conclude that PKCa appears to
   be involved in the impaired brain development observed in perinatal
   hypothyroid rat brain. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Structure-function analysis reveals a novel mechanism for regulation of
   histone demethylase LSD2/AOF1/KDM1b
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB LSD2/A0F1/KDM1b catalyzes demethylation of mono- and di-methylated H3K4
   and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and genomic
   imprinting. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structures of
   apo-LSD2 and LSD2 in complex with a peptide that mimics H3K4me2. Three
   structural domains of LSD2, namely, the novel N-terminal zinc finger,
   the centrally located SWIRM domain, and the C-terminal oxidase domain,
   closely pack together to form a boot-shaped structure. The active site
   cavity in the oxidase domain is large enough to accommodate several
   residues of the histone H3 tail and cannot discriminate between the
   different states of H3K4 methylation. The N-terminal zinc-finger domain,
   composed of a novel C4H2C2-type zinc finger and a specific CW-type zinc
   finger, is required for demethylase activity and, surprisingly, the
   binding of cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). In fact, a relay
   of extensive interactions through the zinc finger-SWIRM-oxidase domains
   is required for LSD2 demethylase activity and the binding of FAD. These
   results reveal a novel mechanism for the zinc finger and SWIRM domains
   in controlling LSD2 demethylase activity and provide a framework for
   elucidating the regulation and function of LSD2.

   sought to identify functional Af9 cis-element(s) in the -57/+439 "R3"
   subregion of alpha ENaC, the principal site for Dot1a-Af9 interaction,
   in mIMCD3 cells. We also exploited connecting tubule/collecting
   duct-specific Dot1l-deficient mice (Dot1l(AC)) to determine the impact
   of Dot1l inactivation on renal alpha ENaC expression in vivo. mIMCD3
   cell lines expressing alpha ENaC promoter-reporter constructs harboring
   deletion of +74/+107 demonstrated greatly reduced association of Af9 and
   Dot1a by ChIP/qPCR. Aldosterone treatment resulted in further decrements
   in Af9 and Dot1a association with the alpha ENaC promoter. Gel shift and
   antibody competition assays using wild-type and mutant oligomers
   revealed Af9-containing +78/+92 alpha ENaC DNA-protein complexes in
   nuclear extracts of mIMCD3 cells. Mutation of the +78/+92 element
   resulted in higher basal alpha ENaC promoter activity and impaired
   Dot1a-mediated inhibition in trans-repression assays. In agreement, mice
   with connecting tubule/collecting duct-specific knockout of Dot1l
   exhibited greater alpha ENaC mRNA levels in kidney compared with
   control. Thus, we conclude that +78/+92 of alpha ENaC represents the
   primary Af9 binding site involved in recruiting Dot1a to repress basal
   and aldosterone-sensitive alpha ENaC transcription and that Dot1l
   inactivation promotes alpha ENaC mRNA expression by eliminating
   Dot1a-mediated repression.

TI Insulin-like growth factor 1 promotes the proliferation and adipogenesis
   of orbital adipose-derived stromal cells in thyroid-associated
   ophthalmopathy
SO EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH
AB Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is characterised by increased
   volume of the orbital contents involving adipose tissue, but the factors
   responsible for stimulation of orbital adipogenesis remain uncertain.
   Previous studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is
   increased in the orbital fatty connective tissues of patients with TAO.
   The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of IGF-1 on
   orbital adipose-derived stromal cells (OADSCs) derived from TAO patients
   and to identify the signalling mechanisms involved. Our results showed
   that IGF-1 significantly promoted the cell proliferation and lipid
   accumulation of TAO OADSCs. The mRNA expression of adipogenic markers
   (adiponectin, leptin, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein [AP2] and
   fatty acid synthase [FAS]) was increased in TAO cultures treated with
   IGF-1. Further research demonstrated that the protein levels of
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) were
   up-regulated when OADSCs were treated with IGF-1. We also found that the
   inhibition of either IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) or phosphoinositide
   3-kinase (PI3K) activity decreased the levels of IGF-1-stimulated mRNA
   encoding adiponectin, leptin, AP2, and FAS, as well as PPAR gamma
   protein levels. Moreover, the expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt)
   protein in TAO cells was up-regulated by IGF-1, while a specific PI3K
   inhibitor (LY294002) or an antibody of IGF-1R blocked this effect. These
   results indicate that IGF-1 is a pro-proliferative and pro-adipogenic
   factor in TAO OADSCs. IGF-1 enhances the adipogenesis of TAO OADSCs by
   up-regulation of PPAR gamma via the activation of the IGF-1R and PI3K
   pathways, suggesting that the blocking of IGF-1R or inhibition of PI3K
   signalling might be a potential novel therapeutic approach to TAO. (C)

TI Epigenetic regulation of memory formation and maintenance
SO LEARNING & MEMORY
AB Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
   formation and maintenance of memories is a central goal of the
   neuroscience community. It is well regarded that an organism's ability
   to lastingly adapt its behavior in response to a transient environmental
   stimulus relies on the central nervous system's capability for
   structural and functional plasticity. This plasticity is dependent on a
   well-regulated program of neurotransmitter release, post-synaptic
   receptor activation, intracellular signaling cascades, gene
   transcription, and subsequent protein synthesis. In the last decade,
   epigenetic markers like DNA methylation and post-translational
   modifications of histone tails have emerged as important regulators of
   the memory process. Their ability to regulate gene transcription
   dynamically in response to neuronal activation supports the
   consolidation of long-term memory. Furthermore, the persistent and
   self-propagating nature of these mechanisms, particularly DNA
   methylation, suggests a molecular mechanism for memory maintenance. In
   this review, we will examine the evidence that supports a role of
   epigenetic mechanisms in learning and memory. In doing so, we hope to
   emphasize (1) the widespread involvement of these mechanisms across
   different behavioral paradigms and distinct brain regions, (2) the
   temporal and genetic specificity of these mechanisms in response to
   upstream signaling cascades, and (3) the functional outcome these
   mechanisms may have on structural and functional plasticity. Finally, we
   consider the future directions of neuroepigenetic research as it relates
   to neuronal storage of information.

TI Neonatal hyperthyrotropinemia is associated with low birth weight: a
   twin study
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Objective: Contradictory reports ascribe neonatal hyperthyrotropinemia
   (HT) to prematurity or small weight for gestational age. We aimed to
   evaluate the association between neonatal HT and birth weight (BW),
   recovery rate of the disorder, and possible association with perinatal
   stress.
   Design: Based on a neonatal screening database, a retrospective twin
   study was designed where within-pair differences in thyroid function
   were evaluated while controlling for differences in gestational age and
   thyroid-affecting environmental confounders.
   Methods: Two thousand five hundred and ninety-five twin pairs that were
   screened both for TSH and thyroxine (T(4)) over 3 years were included.
   TSH and T(4) levels were evaluated along with BW, birth order, gender,
   and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) that was considered as a surrogate
   marker for stress.
   Results: Of all the twin pairs, 7.2% had neonatal HT. Among 156 pairs,
   HT was more prevalent in the smaller twins (64%; P<0.001), especially in
   the discordant pairs (76%; P=0.001). Seventy-five percent of the twins
   demonstrated a recovery within the first few weeks of life. 17OHP levels
   were similarly distributed between twins with and without HT. In a
   cohort of 1534 twin pairs with normal thyroid function, mean TSH levels
   were significantly higher in the smaller than in the larger twin in the
   whole group (4.1+/-3.2 vs 3.8+/-2.9 mIU/l; P<0.001) and especially among
   discordant twins (4.7+/-3.4 vs 3.8+/-3.0 mIU/l; P<0.001).
   Conclusions: Elevated TSH levels are associated with low BW, both in
   infants with HT and in normal neonates. A rapid recovery rate is
   expected in most cases. European Journal of Endocrinology 168 263-269

TI Transgenerational programming of maternal behaviour by prenatal stress
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB Peripartum events hold the potential to have dramatic effects in the
   programming of physiology and behaviour of offspring and possibly
   subsequent generations. Here we have characterized transgenerational
   changes in rat maternal behaviour as a function of gestational and
   prenatal stress. Pregnant dams of the parental generation were exposed
   to stress from days 12-18 (F0-S). Their daughters and grand-daughters
   were either stressed (F1-SS, F2-SSS) or non-stressed (F1-SN, F2-SNN).
   Maternal antepartum behaviours were analyzed at a time when pregnant
   dams usually show a high frequency of tail chasing behaviours. F1-SS,
   F2-SNN and F2-SSS groups showed a significant reduction in tail chasing
   behaviours when compared with controls. The effects of multigenerational
   stress (SSS) slightly exceeded those of transgenerational stress (SNN)
   and resulted in absence of tail chasing behaviour. These findings
   suggest that antepartum maternal behaviour in rats is programmed by
   transgenerational inheritance of stress responses. Thus, altered
   antepartum maternal behaviour may serve as an indicator of an activated
   stress response during gestation.

TI Tumor development is associated with decrease of TET gene expression and
   5-methylcytosine hydroxylation
SO ONCOGENE
AB The TET (ten eleven translocation) family of alpha-ketoglutarate
   (alpha-KG)-dependent dioxygenases catalyzes the sequential oxidation of
   5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC),
   5-formyleytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, leading to eventual DNA
   demethylation. The TET2 gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor frequently
   mutated in leukemia, and TET enzyme activity is inhibited in
   IDH1/2-mutated tumors by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, an
   antagonist of alpha-KG, linking 5mC oxidation to cancer development. We
   report here that the levels of 5hmC are dramatically reduced in human
   breast, liver, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers when compared with
   the matched surrounding normal tissues. Associated with the 5hmC
   decrease is the substantial reduction of the expression of all three TET
   genes, revealing a possible mechanism for the reduced 5hmC in cancer
   cells. The decrease of 5hmC was also observed during tumor development
   in different genetically engineered mouse models. Together, our results
   identify 5hmC as a biomarker whose decrease is broadly and tightly
   associated with tumor development. Oncogene (2013) 32, 663-669;

TI Influence of cloning by chromatin transfer on placental gene expression
   at Day 45 of pregnancy in cattle
SO ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB Poor success rates in somatic cell cloning are often attributed to
   abnormal early embryonic development as well as late abnormal fetal
   growth and placental development. Although promising results have been
   reported following chromatin transfer (CT), a novel cloning method that
   includes the remodeling of the donor nuclei in vitro prior to their
   transfer into enucleated oocytes, animals cloned by CT show placental
   abnormalities similar to those observed following conventional nuclear
   transfer. We hypothesized that the placental gene expression pattern
   from cloned fetuses was ontologically related to the frequently observed
   placental phenotype. The aim of the present study was to compare global
   gene expression by microarray analysis of Day 44-47 cattle placentas
   derived from CT cloned fetuses with those derived from in vitro
   fertilization (i.e. control), and confirm the altered mRNA and protein
   expression of selected molecules by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry,
   respectively. The differentially expressed genes identified in the
   present study are known to be involved in a range of activities
   associated with cell adhesion, cell cycle control, intracellular
   transport and proteolysis. Specifically, an imprinted gene, involved
   with cell proliferation and placentomegaly in humans (CDKN1C) and a
   peptidase that serves as a marker for non-invasive trophoblast cells in
   human placentas (DPP4), had mRNA and protein altered in CT placentas. It
   was concluded that the altered pattern of gene expression observed in CT
   samples may contribute to the abnormal placental development phenotypes
   commonly identified in cloned offspring, and that expression of
   imprinted as well as trophoblast invasiveness-related genes is altered
   in cattle cloned by CT. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Brg1 governs distinct pathways to direct multiple aspects of mammalian
   neural crest cell development
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Development of the cerebral vessels, pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs).
   and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) requires multipotent neural crest cells
   (NCCs) that migrate from the neural tube to target tissue destinations.
   Little is known about how mammalian NCC development is orchestrated by
   gene programming at the chromatin level, however. Here we show that
   Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), an ATPase subunit of the
   Brg1/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is
   required in NCCs to direct cardiovascular development. Mouse embryos
   lacking Brg1 in NCCs display immature cerebral vessels, aberrant PAA
   patterning, and shortened OFT. Brg1 suppresses an apoptosis factor,
   Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and a cell cycle inhibitor,
   p21(cip1), to inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of NCCs,
   thereby maintaining a multipotent cell reservoir at the neural crest.
   Brg1 also supports Myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11) expression to allow
   NCCs to develop into mature vascular smooth muscle cells of cerebral
   vessels. Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler
   Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2
   promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin
   to guide NCCs into the OFT. Our findings reveal an important role for
   Brg1 and its downstream pathways in the survival, differentiation, and
   migration of the multipotent NCCs critical for mammalian cardiovascular
   development.

TI Germline DNA Demethylation Dynamics and Imprint Erasure Through
   5-Hydroxymethylcytosine
SO SCIENCE
AB Mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo sequential epigenetic changes
   and genome-wide DNA demethylation to reset the epigenome for
   totipotency. Here, we demonstrate that erasure of CpG methylation (5mC)
   in PGCs occurs via conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), driven
   by high levels of TET1 and TET2. Global conversion to 5hmC initiates
   asynchronously among PGCs at embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E10.5 and accounts
   for the unique process of imprint erasure. Mechanistically, 5hmC
   enrichment is followed by its protracted decline thereafter at a rate
   consistent with replication-coupled dilution. The conversion to 5hmC is
   an important component of parallel redundant systems that drive
   comprehensive reprogramming in PGCs. Nonetheless, we identify rare
   regulatory elements that escape systematic DNA demethylation in PGCs,
   providing a potential mechanistic basis for transgenerational epigenetic
   inheritance.

TI Transcriptional Regulation Patterns Revealed by High Resolution
   Chromatin Immunoprecipitation during Cardiac Hypertrophy
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by a generalized increase in gene
   expression that is commensurate with the increase in myocyte size and
   mass, on which is superimposed more robust changes in the expression of
   specialized genes. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional
   mechanisms play fundamental roles in these processes; however,
   genome-wide characterization of the transcriptional changes has not been
   investigated. Our goal was to identify the extent and modes, RNA
   polymerase II (pol II) pausing versus recruitment, of transcriptional
   regulation underlying cardiac hypertrophy. We used anti-pol II and
   anti-histone H3K9-acetyl (H3K9ac) chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep
   sequencing to determine the extent of pol II recruitment and pausing,
   and the underlying epigenetic modifications, respectively, during
   cardiac growth. The data uniquely reveal two mutually exclusive modes of
   transcriptional regulation. One involves an incremental increase
   (30-50%) in the elongational activity of preassembled, promoter-paused,
   pol II, and encompasses similar to 25% of expressed genes that are
   essential/housekeeping genes (e. g. RNA synthesis and splicing). Another
   involves a more robust activation via de novo pol II recruitment,
   encompassing similar to 5% of specialized genes (e. g. contractile and
   extracellular matrix). Moreover, the latter subset has relatively
   shorter 3'-UTRs with fewer predicted targeting miRNA, whereas most miRNA
   targets fall in the former category, underscoring the significance of
   posttranscriptional regulation by miRNA. The results, for the first
   time, demonstrate that promoter-paused pol II plays a role in
   incrementally increasing housekeeping genes, proportionate to the
   increase in heart size. Additionally, the data distinguish between the
   roles of posttranscriptional versus transcriptional regulation of
   specific genes.

TI Latent Regulatory Potential of Human-Specific Repetitive Elements
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB At least half of the human genome is derived from repetitive elements,
   which are often lineage specific and silenced by a variety of genetic
   and epigenetic mechanisms. Using a transchromosomic mouse strain that
   transmits an almost complete single copy of human chromosome 21 via the
   female germline, we show that a heterologous regulatory environment can
   transcriptionally activate transposon-derived human regulatory regions.
   In the mouse nucleus, hundreds of locations on human chromosome 21 newly
   associate with activating histone modifications in both somatic and
   germline tissues, and influence the gene expression of nearby
   transcripts. These regions are enriched with primate and human
   lineage-specific transposable elements, and their activation corresponds
   to changes in DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. This study reveals
   the latent regulatory potential of the repetitive human genome and
   illustrates the species specificity of mechanisms that control it.

TI Tbf1 and Vid22 promote resection and non-homologous end joining of DNA
   double-strand break ends
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for maintaining
   genome stability. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Tbf1, which is
   characterized by a Myb domain and is related to mammalian TRF1 and TRF2,
   has been proposed to act as a transcriptional activator. Here, we show
   that Tbf1 and its interacting protein Vid22 are new players in the
   response to DSBs. Inactivation of either TBF1 or VID22 causes
   hypersensitivity to DSB-inducing agents and shows strong negative
   interactions with mutations affecting homologous recombination.
   Furthermore, Tbf1 and Vid22 are recruited to an HO-induced DSB, where
   they promote both resection of DNA ends and repair by non-homologous end
   joining. Finally, inactivation of either Tbf1 or Vid22 impairs
   nucleosome eviction around the DSB, suggesting that these proteins
   promote efficient repair of the break by influencing chromatin identity
   in its surroundings. The EMBO Journal (2013) 32, 275-289.

TI The Role of NEDD1 Phosphorylation by Aurora A in Chromosomal Microtubule
   Nucleation and Spindle Function
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB Chromatin directs de novo microtubule (MT) nucleation in dividing cells
   by generating a gradient of GTP-bound Ran protein (RanGTP) that controls
   the activity of a number of spindle assembly factors (SAFs) [1]. It is
   now well established that these MTs are essential for the assembly of a
   functional bipolar spindle [2]. Although it has been shown that
   RanGTP-dependent MT nucleation requires gamma-tubulin and a number of
   RanGTP-regulated proteins [3, 4], the mechanism involved is still poorly
   understood. We previously showed that the mitotic kinase Aurora A, which
   is activated in a RanGTP-dependent manner in mitotic cells, has a role
   in this pathway [5]. Here we show that Aurora A interacts with and
   phosphorylates the gamma TURC adaptor protein NEDD1 at a single residue,
   Ser405. Ser405 phosphorylation is not required for centrosomal MT
   nucleation but is critical for MT nucleation in the vicinity of the
   chromosomes in mitotic cells. Moreover, it is essential for RanGTP aster
   formation and chromatin-driven MT assembly in Xenopus egg extracts. Our
   data suggest that one important function of Aurora A in mitotic cells is
   to promote MT nucleation around the chromatin by phosphorylating NEDD1,
   and thereby to promote functional spindle assembly.

TI Acidic Nucleoplasmic DNA-binding Protein (And-1) Controls Chromosome
   Congression by Regulating the Assembly of Centromere Protein A (CENP-A)
   at Centromeres
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The centromere is an epigenetically designated chromatin domain that is
   essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.
   The incorporation of centromere protein A (CENP-A) into chromatin is
   fundamental in defining the centromeric loci. Newly synthesized CENP-A
   is loaded at centromeres in early G(1) phase by the CENP-A-specific
   histone chaperone Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP) coupled
   with other chromatin assembly factors. However, it is unknown whether

   (And-1) as a new factor that is required for the assembly of CENP-A
   nucleosomes. And-1 interacts with both CENP-A and HJURP in a
   prenucleosomal complex, and the association of And-1 with CENP-A is
   increased during the cell cycle transition from mitosis to G(1) phase.
   And-1 down-regulation significantly compromises chromosome congression
   and the deposition of HJURP-CENP-A complexes at centromeres.
   Consistently, overexpression of And-1 enhances the assembly of CENP-A at
   centromeres. We conclude that And-1 is an important factor that
   functions together with HJURP to facilitate the cell cycle-specific
   recruitment of CENP-A to centromeres.

TI Selenium and sulindac are synergistic to inhibit intestinal
   tumorigenesis in Apc/p21 mice
SO JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Both selenium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
   (NSAID) sulindac are effective in cancer prevention, but their effects
   are affected by several factors including epigenetic alterations and
   gene expression. The current study was designed to determine the effects
   of the combination of selenium and sulindac on tumor inhibition and the
   underlying mechanisms.
   Results: We fed the intestinal tumor model Apc/p21 mice with
   selenium-and sulindac- supplemented diet for 24 weeks, and found that
   the combination of selenium and sulindac significantly inhibited
   intestinal tumorigenesis, in terms of reducing tumor incidence by 52%
   and tumor multiplicities by 80% (p<0.01). Mechanistic studies revealed
   that the combination of selenium and sulindac led to the significant
   induction of the expression of p27 and p53 and JNK1 phosphorylation, and
   led to the suppression of beta-catenin and its downstream targets.
   Impressively, the data also showed that demythelation on p21 promoter
   was associated with tumor inhibition by the combination of selenium and
   sulindac.
   Conclusions: The selenium is synergistic with sulindac to exert maximal
   effects on tumor inhibition. This finding provides an important
   chemopreventive strategy using combination of anti-cancer agents, which
   has a great impact on cancer prevention and has a promising
   translational potential.

TI Thyroid hormone and retinoic acid interact to regulate zebrafish
   craniofacial neural crest development
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Craniofacial and ocular morphogenesis require proper regulation of
   cranial neural crest migration, proliferation, survival and
   differentiation. Although alterations in maternal thyroid hormone (TH)
   are associated with congenital craniofacial anomalies, the role of TH on
   the neural crest has not been previously described. Using zebrafish, we
   demonstrate that pharmacologic and genetic alterations in TH signaling
   disrupt cranial neural crest migration, proliferation, and survival,
   leading to craniofacial, extraocular muscle, and ocular developmental
   abnormalities. In the rostral cranial neural crest that gives rise to
   the periocular mesenchyme and the frontonasal process, retinoic acid
   (RA) rescued migratory defects induced by decreased TH signaling. In the
   caudal cranial neural crest, TH and RA had reciprocal effects on
   anterior and posterior pharyngeal arch development. The interactions
   between TH and RA signaling were partially mediated by the retinoid X
   receptor. We conclude that TH regulates both rostral and caudal cranial
   neural crest. Further, coordinated interactions of TH and RA are
   required for proper craniofacial and ocular development. (C) 2012

TI PASS-bis: a bisulfite aligner suitable for whole methylome analysis of
   Illumina and SOLiD reads
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB The sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA (Bi-Seq) is becoming a gold
   standard for methylation studies. The mapping of Bi-Seq reads is complex
   and requires special alignment algorithms. This problem is particularly
   relevant for SOLiD color space, where the bisulfite conversion C/T
   changes two adjacent colors into 16 possible combinations. Here, we
   present an algorithm that efficiently aligns Bi-Seq reads obtained
   either from SOLiD or Illumina. An accompanying methylation-caller
   program creates a genomic view of methylated and unmethylated Cs on both
   DNA strands.

TI Genetic and epigenetic alterations in primary colorectal cancers and
   related lymph node and liver metastases
SO CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis and survival are strictly
   related to the development of distant metastases. New targeted therapies
   have increased patient survival, but the objective response rate is
   still very limited, partially because of a traditional focus on
   designing treatment according to the molecular profile of the primary
   tumor regardless the diversity between the primary tumor and metastases.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of molecular
   heterogeneity during metastatic progression and its potential impact on
   clinical treatment. METHODS: The authors analyzed v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat
   sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) codon 12 mutations, the v-Raf
   murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) thymine to adenine
   substitution at codon 1788, and tumor protein 53 (p53) mutations and
   investigated promoter methylation of Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6)
   domain family member 1 protein (RASSF1a), E-cadherin, and
   cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16INK4a) in 101 primary CRCs (67
   stage III and 34 stage IV) and related lymph node and liver metastases.
   RESULTS: Lymph node metastases were characterized by fewer alterations
   compared with primary tumors and liver metastases, especially KRAS (P =
   .03) and p16INK4a (P = .05). Genetic changes, when detectable in
   metastases, mostly were retained from the primary tumor, whereas
   epigenetic changes more frequently were acquired de novo. Overall, 31
   distinct CRC molecular profiles were detected, none of which
   characterized a particular tumor stage. When the metastatic lesions also
   were included in the profiles, there were 53 distinct molecular profiles
   in 67 patients with stage III disease and 34 distinct molecular profiles
   in 34 patients with stage IV disease. CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node and liver
   metastases appear to originate in clonally different processes, with
   more molecular alterations occurring in distant metastases than in lymph
   node metastases and with elevated heterogeneity of the primary tumor.
   Thus, potential prognostic targets should be carefully evaluated for
   their heterogeneity in both primary tumors and distant metastases to
   avoid erroneous misclassification. Cancer 2013. (c) 2012 American Cancer

TI Carbaryl exposure and recovery modify the interrenal and thyroidal
   activities and the mitochondria-rich cell function in the climbing perch
   Anabas testudineus Bloch
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB We examined the effects of carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate; sevin),
   a carbamate pesticide, on interrenal and thyroid activities and
   mitochondria! rich (MR) cell function in climbing perch to understand
   the physiological basis of toxicity acclimation in this fish to the
   chemical stressor. Carbaryl exposure (5-20 mg L(-1)) for 48 h increased
   cortisol and glucose, but decreased the T(3) level without affecting
   T(4) concentration in the plasma. These responses of the
   carbaryl-exposed fish were nullified and a rise in plasma T(4) occurred
   in these fish when they were kept for 96 h recovery in clean water. A
   tight plasma mineral control was indicated in the carbaryl-exposed fish
   as reflected by the unchanged plasma Na, K and inorganic phosphate
   levels. The ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity showed an
   increase in the gills but the intestinal and renal tissues showed little
   response to carbaryl treatment. However, substantial increases in the
   intestinal and renal Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities occurred in the
   recovery fish. The MR cells in the branchial epithelia showed a strong
   Na(+), K(+)-ATPase immunoreactivity to carbaryl treatment indicating an
   activated MR cell function. The numerical MR cell density remained
   unchanged, but stretching of secondary gill lamellae as part of gill
   remodeling occurred during carbaryl exposure. The increased surface of
   these lamellae with abundant MR cells as a result of its migration into
   the lamellar surface points to marked structural and functional
   modifications of these cells in the carbaryl-treated fish which is
   likely to a target for carbaryl action. The rise in plasma T(4) and the
   restoration of normal branchial epithelia in the recovery fish indicate
   a thyroidal involvement in the recovery response and survival. Our data
   thus provide evidence that carbaryl exposure and its recovery evoke
   interrenal and thyroid disruption in this fish leading to a modified
   osmotic response including an altered MR cell function. (C) 2012

TI The stress response of three-spined sticklebacks is modified in
   proportion to effluent exposure downstream of wastewater treatment works
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB This study was conducted to investigate whether exposure to wastewater
   treatment works (WWTW) effluent affects the adaptive stress axis of fish
   resident within the receiving water. Three-spined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were sampled from sites downstream of ten WWTWs
   in north-west England, selected to represent a range of human population
   equivalents between 1000 and 125,000. Following capture, indices of
   stress (whole-body cortisol and glucose concentrations) were measured
   both prior to, and following, the imposition of a standardised stressor
   to establish both baseline and stress-induced concentrations of cortisol
   and glucose. There was considerable between-site variation in size, and
   to a lesser extent condition, of the fish. Pre- and post-stress cortisol
   and glucose concentrations also varied significantly between-sites. A
   large proportion of the variation in both the somatic data and the
   stress response was explained by variation in the proportion of effluent
   contributing to total river flow at the study sites. Mass (r(2)=0.35,
   P<0.001) and length (r(2)=0.37, P<0.001) of the fish, and cortisol
   (r(2)= 0.26, P<0.001) and glucose (r(2)=0.12, P<0.01) concentrations in
   unstressed sticklebacks, were positively related to the concentration of
   effluent across the sample sites. However, in stressed fish, cortisol
   (r(2)=0.32, P<0.001) and glucose (r(2)=0.14, P<0.001) concentrations
   exhibited a negative trend in relation to the effluent concentrations
   across sites. Individual variation in fish size did not account for the
   variation in either cortisol or glucose levels. These data provide the
   first indication that modulation of the stress axis in fish by
   anthropogenic factors might be widespread and of greater significance
   than hitherto assumed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI CXCR2 Expression in Tumor Cells Is a Poor Prognostic Factor and Promotes
   Invasion and Metastasis in Lung Adenocarcinoma
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB CXCR2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been studied mainly in
   stromal cells and is known to increase tumor inflammation and
   angiogenesis. Here, we examined the prognostic importance of CXCR2 in
   NSCLC and the role of CXCR2 and its ligands in lung cancer cells. The
   effect of CXCR2 expression on tumor cells was studied using stable
   knockdown clones derived from a murine KRAS/p53-mutant lung
   adenocarcinoma cell line with high metastatic potential and an
   orthotopic syngeneic mouse model and in vitro using a CXCR2
   small-molecule antagonist (SB225002). CXCR2 protein expression was
   analyzed in tumor cells from 262 NSCLC. Gene expression profiles for
   CXCR2 and its ligands (CXCR2 axis) were analyzed in 52 human NSCLC cell
   lines and 442 human lung adenocarcinomas. Methylation of CXCR2 axis
   promoters was determined in 70 human NSCLC cell lines. Invasion and
   metastasis were decreased in CXCR2 knockdown clones in vitro and in
   vivo. SB225002 decreased invasion in vitro. In lung adenocarcinomas,
   CXCR2 expression in tumor cells was associated with smoking and poor
   prognosis. CXCR2 axis gene expression profiles in human NSCLC cell lines
   and lung adenocarcinomas defined a cluster driven by CXCL5 and
   associated with smoking, poor prognosis, and RAS pathway activation.
   Expression of CXCL5 was regulated by promoter methylation. The CXCR2
   axis may be an important target in smoking-related lung adenocarcinoma.

TI Investigations on the oxygen dependence of a 2-oxoglutarate histone
   demethylase
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Histone N(epsilon)-methyl lysine demethylases are important in
   epigenetic regulation. KDM4E (histone lysine demethylase 4E) is a
   representative member of the large Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent
   family of human histone demethylases. In the present study we report
   kinetic studies on the reaction of KDM4E with O(2). Steady-state assays
   showed that KDM4E has a graded response to O(2) over a physiologically
   relevant range of O(2) concentrations. Pre-steady state assays implied
   that KDM4E reacts slowly with O(2) and that there are variations in the
   reaction kinetics which are dependent on the methylation status of the
   substrate. The results demonstrate the potential for histone demethylase
   activity to be regulated by oxygen availability.

TI MAP kinase signalling cascades and transcriptional regulation
SO GENE
AB The MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways play fundamental roles in a
   wide range of cellular processes and are often deregulated in disease
   states. One major mode of action for these pathways is in controlling
   gene expression, in particular through regulating transcription. In this
   review, we discuss recent significant advances in this area. In
   particular we focus on the mechanisms by which MAPKs are targeted to the
   nucleus and chromatin, and once there, how they impact on chromatin
   structure and subsequent gene regulation. We also discuss how systems
   biology approaches have contributed to our understanding of MAPK
   signaling networks, and also how the MAPK pathways intersect with other
   regulatory pathways in the nucleus. Finally; we summarise progress in
   studying the physiological functions of key MAPK transcriptional

TI Cloning and characterization of two genes coding for the histone
   acetyltransferases, Elp3 and Mof, in brown planthopper (BPH),
   Nilaparvata lugens (Stal)
SO GENE
AB Histone acetylation is a vital mechanism for the post-translational
   modifications of chromatin components. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs)
   are critical elements that determine histone acetylation and regulate
   chromatin dynamics and gene expression. While histone acetyltransferases
   have been well studied in mammals and Drosophila melanogaster,
   information from agriculturally important insect pests is still limited.
   In our effort to understand the epigenetic mechanisms regulating
   development in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal)
   (Hemiptera: Geometroidea), a major rice pest in many parts of Asia, two
   full-length cDNA sequences encoding HAT members of the GNAT and MYST
   family, namely NlElp3 and NlMof, respectively, were isolated and
   structurally and phylogenetically characterized. The NlElp3 contains an
   open reading frame (ORF) of 1656 bp encoding a protein of 551 amino
   acids. The NlMof contains a 1353 bp ORF encoding a protein of 450 amino
   acids. Sequence analysis showed that NlElp3 contains GNAT-type HAT
   domain and Radical SAM domain, and NlMof contains chromodomain and
   MOZ-SAS acetyltransferase domain. Multiple sequence alignments showed
   that NlElp3 and NlMof have high amino add sequence identity with other
   insect homologues. Expression analysis of the NlElp3 and NlMof revealed
   significant differences in mRNA expression levels among N. lugens
   developmental stages, suggesting that HAT activities of NlElp3 and NlMof
   may be controlled, at least in part, by their developmental regulation.
   Remarkably, the mRNA expression levels of NlElp3 and NlMof in female
   adults were significantly higher than that in male adults, supporting an
   important role for both genes in female reproductive function in N.

TI Mycobacterium tuberculosis S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase is
   negatively regulated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SahH) is known as an ubiquitous player
   in methylation-based process that maintains the intracellular
   S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) equilibrium.
   Given its crucial role in central metabolism in both eukaryotes and
   prokaryotes, it is assumed that SahH must be regulated, albeit little is
   known regarding molecular mechanisms governing its activity. We report
   here that SahH from Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be phosphorylated by
   mycobacterial Ser/Thr protein kinases and that phosphorylation
   negatively affects its enzymatic activity. Mass spectrometric analyses
   and site-directed mutagenesis identified Thr2 and Thr221 as the two
   phosphoacceptors. SahH_T2D, SahH_T221D and SahH_T2D/T221D, designed to
   mimic constitutive phosphorylation, exhibited markedly decreased
   activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Both residues are fully
   conserved in other mycobacterial SahH orthologues, suggesting that SahH
   phosphorylation on Thr2 and Thr221 may represent a novel and presumably
   more general mechanism of regulation of the SAH/SAM balance in
   mycobacteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Ecdysone-responsive transcriptional regulation determines the temporal
   expression of cuticular protein genes in wing discs of Bombyx mori
SO GENE
AB The present study was conducted to clarify the regulatory mechanism of
   cuticular protein genes of Bombyx mori expressed in wing discs in the
   prepupal stage. BHR3, BHR4, E74A, and beta FTZ-F1 were successively
   expressed in wing discs at the pre-pupal stage. BHR3 showed different
   ecdysone responsiveness from other ecdysone-responsive transcription
   factors (ERTFs) and was induced by ecdysone addition but showed decrease
   by ecdysone removal after treatment (ecdysone pulse). BHR4 and E74A were
   induced by the ecdysone addition and by the ecdysone pulse. beta FTZ-F1
   was not induced by the ecdysone addition but was induced by the ecdysone
   pulse. Thus, ERTFs showed different hormone responsiveness, resulting in
   the different expression timing. We selected cuticular protein genes
   that showed the same expression stage with each transcription factor and
   examined their ecdysone responsiveness. The developmental expression and
   ecdysone responsiveness of BmorCPH5, BmorCPR34, BmorCPR23, and BmorCPR99
   resembled those of BHR3, BHR4, E74A, and beta FTZ-F1, respectively. The
   results of the transient reporter assay strongly suggested the
   regulation of each cuticular protein promoter by ERTF. These ERTFs
   regulated different cuticular protein genes and determined their
   expression timing and probably the nature of the cuticle layer of
   insects. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Binding of Multiple Nuclear Receptors to a Single Regulatory Region
   Is Important for the Proper Expression of EDG84A in Drosophila
   melanogaster
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Nuclear receptor transcription factor family members share target
   sequence similarity; however, little is known about how these factors
   exert their specific regulatory control. Here, we examine the mechanism
   regulating the expression of the Drosophila EDG84A gene, a target gene
   of the orphan nuclear receptor beta FTZ-F1, as a model to study the
   cooperative behavior among nuclear receptors. We show that the three
   nuclear receptors beta FTZ-F1, DHR3, and DHR39 bind to a common element
   in the EDG84A promoter. The expression level of the EDG84A promoter-lacZ
   reporter genes in DHR39-induced and mutant animals, respectively,
   suggests that DHR39 works as a repressor. The activity of a reporter
   gene carrying a mutation preventing DHR3 binding was reduced in ftz-f1
   mutants and rescued by the induced expression of beta FTZ-F1, suggesting
   that DHR3 and beta FTZ-F1 activate the EDG84A gene in a redundant
   manner. A reporter gene carrying a mutation that abolishes DHR39 and
   FTZ-F1 binding was prematurely expressed, and the expression level of
   the reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing DHR3 binding was
   reduced. These findings suggest that the temporal expression of this
   gene is mainly controlled by beta FTZ-F1 but that the binding of DHR3 is
   also important. Comparison of the binding site sequence among Drosophila
   species suggests that DHR3 binding ability was gained after the
   melanogastersubgroup evolved, and this ability may contribute to the
   robust expression of this gene. These results show the complicated
   regulatory mechanisms utilized by multiple nuclear receptors to properly
   regulate the expression of their target gene through a single target
   site. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A gene loop containing the floral repressor FLC is disrupted in the
   early phase of vernalization
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB Gene activation in eukaryotes frequently involves interactions between
   chromosomal regions. We have investigated whether higher-order chromatin
   structures are involved in the regulation of the Arabidopsis floral
   repressor gene FLC, a target of several chromatin regulatory pathways.
   Here, we identify a gene loop involving the physical interaction of the
   5' and 3' flanking regions of the FLC locus using chromosome
   conformation capture. The FLC loop is unaffected by mutations disrupting
   conserved chromatin regulatory pathways leading to very different
   expression states. However, the loop is disrupted during vernalization,
   the cold-induced, Polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of FLC. Loop
   disruption parallels timing of the cold-induced FLC transcriptional
   shut-down and upregulation of FLC antisense transcripts, but does not
   need a cold-induced PHD protein required for the epigenetic silencing.
   We suggest that gene loop disruption is an early step in the switch from
   an expressed to a Polycomb-silenced state. The EMBO Journal (2013) 32,

TI Gestational Stress Promotes Pathological Apneas and Sex-Specific
   Disruption of Respiratory Control Development in Newborn Rat
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Recurrent apneas are important causes of hospitalization and morbidity
   in newborns. Gestational stress (GS) compromises fetal brain
   development. Maternal stress and anxiety during gestation are linked to
   respiratory disorders in newborns; however, the mechanisms remain
   unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated activation of the
   neuroendocrine response to stress during gestation is sufficient to
   disrupt the development of respiratory control and augment the
   occurrence of apneas in newborn rats. Pregnant dams were displaced and
   exposed to predator odor from days 9 to 19 of gestation. Control dams
   were undisturbed. Experiments were performed on male and female rats
   aged between 0 and 4 d old. Apnea frequency decreased with age but was
   consistently higher in stressed pups than controls. At day 4, GS
   augmented the proportion of apneas with O(2) desaturations by 12%.
   During acute hypoxia (12% O(2)), the reflexive increase in breathing
   augmented with age; however, this response was lower in stressed pups.
   Instability of respiratory rhythm recorded from medullary preparations
   decreased with age but was higher in stressed pups than controls. GS
   reduced medullary serotonin (5-HT) levels in newborn pups by 32%. Bath
   application of 5-HT and injection of 8-OH-DPAT
   [(+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-di-(n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide; 5-HT(1A)
   agonist; in vivo] reduced respiratory instability and apneas; these
   effects were greater in stressed pups than controls. Sex-specific
   effects were observed. We conclude that activation of the stress
   response during gestation is sufficient to disrupt respiratory control
   development and promote pathological apneas in newborn rats. A deficit
   in medullary 5-HT contributes to these effects.

TI Effects of Cytosine Hydroxymethylation on DNA Strand Separation
SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Cytosine hydroxymethylation is an epigenetic control factor in higher
   organisms. New discoveries of the biological roles of hydroxymethylation
   serve to raise questions about how this epigenetic modification exerts
   its functions and how organisms discriminate cytosine hydroxymethylation
   from methylation. Here, we report investigations that reveal an effect
   of cytosine hydroxymethylation on mechanical properties of DNA under
   load. The findings are based on molecular force assay measurements and
   steered molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular force assay
   experiments identified significant effects of hydroxymethylation on
   stretching-induced strand separation; the underlying physical mechanism
   has been revealed by steered molecular dynamics simulations. We find
   that hydroxymethylation can either upregulate or downregulate DNA's
   strand separation propensity, suggesting that hydroxymethylation can
   control gene expression by facilitating or obstructing the action of
   transcription machinery or the access to chromosomal DNA.

TI Plasma cortisol and faecal cortisol metabolites concentrations in
   stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses: do stereotypic horses cope
   better with poor environmental conditions?
SO BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Background: Stereotypic behaviours, i.e. repetitive behaviours induced
   by frustration, repeated attempts to cope and/or brain dysfunction, are
   intriguing as they occur in a variety of domestic and captive species
   without any clear adaptive function. Among the different hypotheses, the
   coping hypothesis predicts that stereotypic behaviours provide a way for
   animals in unfavourable environmental conditions to adjust. As such,
   they are expected to have a lower physiological stress level
   (glucocorticoids) than non-stereotypic animals. Attempts to link
   stereotypic behaviours with glucocorticoids however have yielded
   contradictory results. Here we investigated correlates of oral and motor
   stereotypic behaviours and glucocorticoid levels in two large samples of
   domestic horses (N(Study1) = 55, N(Study2) = 58), kept in sub-optimal
   conditions (e. g. confinement, social isolation), and already known to
   experience poor welfare states. Each horse was observed in its box using
   focal sampling (study 1) and instantaneous scan sampling (study 2).
   Plasma samples (collected in study 1) but also non-invasive faecal
   samples (collected in both studies) were retrieved in order to assess
   cortisol levels.
   Results: Results showed that 1) plasma cortisol and faecal cortisol
   metabolites concentrations did not differ between horses displaying
   stereotypic behaviours and non-stereotypic horses and 2) both oral and
   motor stereotypic behaviour levels did not predict plasma cortisol or
   faecal cortisol metabolites concentrations.
   Conclusions: Cortisol measures, collected in two large samples of horses
   using both plasma sampling as well as faecal sampling (the latter method
   minimizing bias due to a non-invasive sampling procedure), therefore do
   not indicate that stereotypic horses cope better, at least in terms of
   adrenocortical activity.

TI ATAD5 regulates the lifespan of DNA replication factories by modulating
   PCNA level on the chromatin
SO JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB Temporal and spatial regulation of the replication factory is important
   for efficient DNA replication. However, the underlying molecular
   mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that ATAD5 regulates
   the lifespan of replication factories. Reduced expression of ATAD5
   extended the lifespan of replication factories by retaining
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and other replisome proteins
   on the chromatin during and even after DNA synthesis. This led to an
   increase of inactive replication factories with an accumulation of
   replisome proteins. Consequently, the overall replication rate was
   decreased, which resulted in the delay of S-phase progression. Prevalent
   detection of PCNA foci in G2 phase cells after ATAD5 depletion suggests
   that defects in the disassembly of replication factories persist after S
   phase is complete. ATAD5-mediated regulation of the replication factory
   and PCNA required an intact ATAD5 ATPase domain. Taken together, our
   data imply that ATAD5 regulates the cycle of DNA replication factories,
   probably through its PCNA-unloading activity.

TI Characterization of the Staphylococcus aureus rRNA Methyltransferase
   Encoded by orfX, the Gene Containing the Staphylococcal Chromosome
   Cassette mec (SCCmec) Insertion Site
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The gene orfX is conserved among all staphylococci, and its complete
   sequence is maintained upon insertion of the staphylococcal chromosome
   cassette mec (SCCmec) genomic island, containing the gene encoding
   resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (mecA), into its C terminus. The
   function of OrfX has not been determined. We show that OrfX was
   constitutively produced during growth, that orfX could be inactivated
   without altering bacterial growth, and that insertion of SCCmec did not
   alter gene expression. We solved the crystal structure of OrfX at 1.7
   angstrom and found that it belongs to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine
   (AdoMet)-dependent alpha/beta-knot superfamily of SPOUT
   methyltransferases (MTases), with a high structural homology to YbeA,
   the gene product of the Escherichia coli 70 S ribosomal MTase RlmH.
   MTase activity was confirmed by demonstrating the OrfX-dependent
   methylation of the Staphylococcus aureus 70 S ribosome. When OrfX was
   crystallized in the presence of its AdoMet substrate, we found that each
   monomer of the homodimeric structure bound AdoMet in its active site.
   Solution studies using isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed that
   each monomer bound AdoMet but with different binding affinities (K(d) =
   52 +/- 0.4 and 606 +/- 2 mu M). In addition, the structure shows that
   the AdoMet-binding pocket, formed by a deep trefoil knot, contains a
   bound phosphate molecule, which is the likely nucleotide methylation
   site. This study represents the first characterization of a
   staphylococcal ribosomal MTase and provides the first crystal structure
   of a member of the alpha/beta-knot superfamily of SPOUT MTases in the
   RlmH or COG1576 family with bound AdoMet.

TI Polycomb Group Protein PHF1 Regulates p53-dependent Cell Growth Arrest
   and Apoptosis
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Polycomb group protein PHF1 is well known as a component of a novel
   EED-EZH2.Polycomb repressive complex 2 complex and plays important roles
   in H3K27 methylation and Hox gene silencing. PHF1 is also involved in
   the response to DNA double-strand breaks in human cells, promotes
   nonhomologous end-joining processes through interaction with Ku70/Ku80.
   Here, we identified another function of PHF1 as a potential p53 pathway
   activator in a pathway screen using luminescence reporter assay.
   Subsequent studies showed PHF1 directly interacts with p53 proteins both
   in vivo and in vitro and co-localized in nucleus. PHF1 binds to the
   C-terminal regulatory domain of p53. Overexpression of PHF1 elevated p53
   protein level and prolonged its turnover. Knockdown of PHF1 reduced p53
   protein level and its target gene expression both in normal state and
   DNA damage response. Mechanically, PHF1 protects p53 proteins from
   MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we showed
   that PHF1 regulates cell growth arrest and etoposide-induced apoptosis
   in a p53-dependent manner. Finally, PHF1 expression was significantly
   down-regulated in human breast cancer samples. Taken together, we
   establish PHF1 as a novel positive regulator of the p53 pathway. These
   data shed light on the potential roles of PHF1 in tumorigenesis and/or
   tumor progression.

TI Effect of complex wavelet transform filter on thyroid tumor
   classification in three-dimensional ultrasound
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE
AB Ultrasonography has great potential in differentiating malignant thyroid
   nodules from the benign ones. However, visual interpretation is limited
   by interobserver variability, and further, the speckle distribution
   poses a challenge during the classification process. This article thus
   presents an automated system for tumor classification in
   three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonography data sets. The
   system first processes the contrast-enhanced ultrasonography images
   using complex wavelet transform-based filter to mitigate the effect of
   speckle noise. The higher order spectra features are then extracted and
   used as input for training and testing a fuzzy classifier. In the
   off-line training system, higher order spectra features are extracted
   from a set of images known as the training images. These higher order
   spectra features along with the clinically assigned ground truth are
   used to train the classifier and obtain an estimate of the classifier or
   training parameters. The ground truth tells the class label of the image
   (i.e. whether the image belongs to a benign or malignant nodule). During
   the online testing phase, the estimated classifier parameters are
   applied on the higher order spectra features that are extracted from the
   testing images to predict their class labels. The predicted class labels
   are compared with their corresponding original ground truth to evaluate
   the performance of the classifier. Without utilizing the complex wavelet
   transform filter, the fuzzy classifier demonstrated an accuracy of
   91.6%, while utilizing the complex wavelet transform filter, the
   accuracy significantly boosted to 99.1%.

TI Genistein and Daidzein: Different Molecular Effects on Prostate Cancer
SO ANTICANCER RESEARCH
AB Diet is believed to play an important role in cancer. It has been
   revealed by epidemiological studies that Asian populations, who consume
   phytoestrogens in large amounts, have a lower incidence of prostate
   cancer in comparison with the Western world, where consumption of soy is
   lower. Genistein and daidzein, the soy phytoestrogens most widely
   studied, are believed to be potent anticancer agents and have been shown
   to possess anticancer properties. It has been shown that these compounds
   inhibit the growth of cancer cells through the modulation of genes
   controlling cell-cycle progression. Genistein inhibits the activation of
   the kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF-kappa B),
   signaling pathway, which is implicated in the balance between cell
   survival and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Antioxidant and
   antiangiogenesis properties of genistein have been also described. Soy
   isoflavones are also implicated in reversion of epigenetic events
   observed in prostate cancer. Significant advances have been made for
   understanding how soy isoflavones are implicated in protection against
   prostate cancer. However, more studies are needed to better-understand
   and elucidate all pathways mobilized by genistein and daidzein, in order
   to fully exploit their anticancer properties.

TI Conserved boundary elements from the Hox complex of mosquito, Anopheles
   gambiae
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The conservation of hox genes as well as their genomic organization
   across the phyla suggests that this system of anterior-posterior axis
   formation arose early during evolution and has come under strong
   selection pressure. Studies in the split Hox cluster of Drosophila have
   shown that proper expression of hox genes is dependent on chromatin
   domain boundaries that prevent inappropriate interactions among
   different types of cis-regulatory elements. To investigate whether
   boundary function and their role in regulation of hox genes is conserved
   in insects with intact Hox clusters, we used an algorithm to locate
   potential boundary elements in the Hox complex of mosquito, Anopheles
   gambiae. Several potential boundary elements were identified that could
   be tested for their functional conservation. Comparative analysis
   revealed that like Drosophila, the bithorax region in A. gambiae
   contains an extensive array of boundaries and enhancers organized into
   domains. We analysed a subset of candidate boundary elements and show
   that they function as enhancer blockers in Drosophila. The functional
   conservation of boundary elements from mosquito in fly suggests that
   regulation of hox genes involving chromatin domain boundaries is an
   evolutionary conserved mechanism and points to an important role of such
   elements in key developmentally regulated loci.

TI Cc.snf5, a gene encoding a putative component of the SWI/SNF chromatin
   remodeling complex, is essential for sexual development in the
   agaricomycete Coprinopsis cinerea
SO FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY
AB We characterized a Coprinopsis cinerea mutant strain, Spe20, defective
   in fruiting initiation, which was isolated after restriction
   enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) mutagenesis of a homokaryotic
   fruiting strain, 326. A plasmid rescue followed by complementation
   experiments, RACE, and cDNA analyses revealed that the gene, a mutation
   of which is responsible for the phenotype, is predicted to encode a
   protein that exhibits a high similarity to yeast Snf5p, a key component
   of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, and named Cc.snf5. Cc.Snf5
   is, however, different from Snf5p in that the former has, in addition to
   an Snf5 domain comprising N-terminal repeat1 (rp1) and C-terminal
   repeat2 (rp2) subdomains in a middle region, a GATA Zn-finger domain in
   a C-terminal region. In strain Spe20, plasmid pPHT1 used for REMI is
   inserted in the ORF encoding rp2. This raised the possibility that in
   strain Spe20, the disrupted Cc.Snf5 is functionally active albeit
   incompletely because it retains rp1. Thus, we disrupted the whole SNF5
   domain and its downstream peptide and found that the disruption results
   in inhibition of not only fruiting initiation but also dikaryon
   development, a prerequisite for fruiting. We also found that specific
   disruption of the Zn-finger domain results in inhibition of fruiting
   initiation. These results indicate that Cc.Snf5 plays an essential role
   in sexual development of C cinerea. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Dynamic changes in genomic histone association and modification during
   activation of the ASNS and ATF3 genes by amino acid limitation
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Amino acid deprivation of mammalian cells triggers several signalling
   pathways, the AAR (amino acid response), that results in transcriptional
   activation. For the ASNS (asparagine synthetase) and ATF3 (activating
   transcription factor 3) genes, increased transcription occurs in
   conjunction with recruitment of ATF4 to the gene. In HepG2 cells,
   analysis of the ASNS and ATF3 genes during AAR activation revealed
   increases in histone H3K4me3 (histone 3 trimethylated Lys(4)) and H4Ac
   (acetylated histone 4) levels, marks associated with active
   transcription, but a concurrent loss of total H3 protein near the
   promoter. The dynamic nature of AAR-regulated transcription was
   illustrated by a decline in ASNS transcription activity within minutes
   after removal of the AAR stress and a return to basal levels by 2 h.
   Reversal of ASNS transcription occurred in parallel with decreased
   promoter-associated H4Ac and ATF4 binding. However, the reduction in
   histone H3 and increase in H3K4me3 were not reversed. In yeast,
   persistence of H3K4me3 has been proposed to be a 'memory' mark of gene
   activity that alters the responsiveness of the gene, but the time course
   and magnitude of ASNS induction was unaffected when cells were
   challenged with a second round of AAR activation. The results of the
   present study document changes in gene-associated nucleosome abundance
   and histone modifications in response to amino-acid-dependent
   transcription.

TI Osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of

SO PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB The objective of this study was to verify the osteogenic potential of
   the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of ovariectomized and
   non-ovariectomized female rats with hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Sixty
   two-month-old female rats were assigned to the following groups: (1)
   control (sham-operated), (2) ovariectomized (OVX'd), (3) hypothyroid
   sham-operated (Hypo-), (4) hypothyroid OVX'd, (5) hyperthyroid
   sham-operated (Hyper-) and (6) hyperthyroid OVX'd. After 135 days of
   treatment, the female rats were euthanized. We collected plasma to
   measure the levels of free T4, and the femur for extraction of MSCs. At
   7 and 21 days of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs,
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
   conversion, alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralized nodule number and
   gene expression for collagen I, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein and
   osteopontin were analyzed. The hypothyroid group presented a significant
   reduction in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The hyperthyroid
   group did not present changes in the synthesis of mineralized nodules
   for MSCs at day 21 of differentiation. However, in ovariectomized rats,
   hyperthyroidism increased the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs
   characterized by the increase of the alkaline phosphatase activity, the
   number of mineralized nodules and the expression of osteocalcin,
   sialoprotein and osteopontin. Our results demonstrated that the
   hypothyroidism reduces the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs only in
   non-ovariectomized rats and that the hyperthyroidism increases the
   osteogenic differentiation of MSCs only in ovariectomized rats. (C) 2012

   hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with concomitant thyroid diseases.
   Methods: Forty-three patients with pHPT associated with nodular goiter
   (NG, n=32) and/or autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs, n=11) for a total
   of 63 neck lesions were considered. Sixteen patients displaying HP (16
   lesions), unequivocally localized by sestaMIBI scintigraphy (MIBI) and
   neck ultrasound (US) (group I), were compared with 27 patients (47 neck
   lesions) displaying equivocal parathyroid localization (group II). In
   all cases, neck US, MIBI scan, cytology, and parathyroid hormone assay
   in fine-needle aspiration washout fluid (FNA-PTH) were performed. All
   patients finally underwent surgery.
   Results: According to histological examination, high FNA-PTH values
   (>103 pg/ml) correctly identified all HP in both groups of patients
   (100% of sensitivity and specificity). Both MIBI and US correctly
   identified all HP only in group I patients; in contrast, four patterns
   of mismatch between these techniques were observed in group II patients,
   leading to low diagnostic performances of neck US (71.4% sensitivity and
   78.9% specificity) and of MIBI scan (35.7% sensitivity and 42.1%
   specificity). The latter was due to both false-negative (mainly in AITD)
   and false-positive (mainly in NG) scan images.
   Conclusions: Coexistent thyroid diseases are responsible for mismatch
   between MIBI and US images resulting in equivocal HP localization. In
   these cases, FNA-PTH resulted in the most accurate tool to identify HP.
   However, although safe, it should be advised only to patients with
   uncertain HP localization. European Journal of Endocrinology 168 49-58

TI The significance of epigenetic alterations in lung carcinogenesis
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Lung cancer is recognized as a leading cause of cancer-related death
   worldwide and its frequency is still increasing. The prognosis in lung
   cancer is poor and limited by the difficulties of diagnosis at early
   stage of disease, when it is amenable to surgery treatment. Therefore,
   the advance in identification of lung cancer genetic and epigenetic
   markers with diagnostic and/or prognostic values becomes an important
   tool for future molecular oncology and personalized therapy. As in case
   of other tumors, aberrant epigenetic landscape has been documented also
   in lung cancer, both at early and late stage of carcinogenesis.
   Hypermethylation of specific genes, mainly tumor suppressor genes, as
   well as hypomethylation of oncogenes and retrotransposons, associated
   with histopathological subtypes of lung cancer, has been found.
   Epigenetic aberrations of histone proteins and, especially, the lower
   global levels of histone modifications have been associated with poorer
   clinical outcome in lung cancer. The recently discovered role of
   epigenetic modifications of microRNA expression in tumors has been also
   proven in lung carcinogenesis. The identified epigenetic events in lung
   cancer contribute to its specific epigenotype and correlated phenotypic
   features. So far, some of them have been suggested to be cancer
   biomarkers for early detection, disease monitoring, prognosis, and risk
   assessment. As epigenetic aberrations are reversible, their correction
   has emerged as a promising therapeutic target.

TI Molecular mechanism of WW-domain binding protein-2 coactivation function
   in estrogen receptor signaling
SO IUBMB LIFE
AB The link between breast cancer and estrogen receptor (ER) is well
   established. The ER is a hormone-inducible transcription factor that,
   upon binding to its ligand, regulates the expression of a variety of
   genes mainly involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.
   Coactivators are proteins recruited by the hormone-activated receptor,
   which allow or enhance the ER transactivation functions by acting as
   chromatin remodeling enzymes or adaptors between ER and the
   transcriptional machinery. Our laboratory has previously identified the
   WW-domain binding protein-2 (WBP-2) as a bona fide coactivator of ER.
   However, the molecular mechanism underlying WBP-2 coactivation function
   was not clear yet. In this study, we explore and identify the mechanism
   by which WBP-2 acts as coactivator of ER. Our data show that WBP-2 is
   involved in the regulation of ER target genes, and its expression is
   required for the proper expression of some ER target genes. To clarify
   the molecular mechanism by which WBP-2 regulates ER function, we
   performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We demonstrate here that
   WBP-2 binds to the ER target gene promoter pS2 promoter and is required
   for the binding of the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II
   (associated with active transcription/elongation) to the same promoter.
   Furthermore, we also show that WBP-2 is essential for the recruitment of
   the histone acetyl transferase p300, an important chromatin modifier
   enzyme and for histone acetylation at the same target region.
   Collectively, our data indicate that WBP-2 enhances ER transactivation
   function at certain genes by facilitating the recruitment and/or the
   stabilization of a histone modifier enzyme that favors a relaxed
   chromatin structure, permissive of transcription. (c) 2012 IUBMB Life,

TI Efflux of glutathione and glutathione complexes from human erythrocytes
   in response to vanadate
SO BLOOD CELLS MOLECULES AND DISEASES
AB The main objective of the present study was to investigate if vanadate
   is extruded from the cells in a glutathione dependent manner resulting
   in the appearance of extracellular glutathione and complexes of
   glutathione with vanadium. Vanadate significantly depleted intracellular
   non-protein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in a time- and
   concentration-dependent manner. The intracellular NPSH level was
   decreased to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mu mol/ml erythrocyte when exposed to 10 mM of
   vanadate for 4 h. Extracellular NPSH level was increased concomitantly
   with the intracellular decrease and reached to 0.1410 +/- 0.005 mu
   mol/ml erythrocyte in 4 h. Intracellular decrease and extracellular
   increase in NPSH levels were significantly inhibited in the presence of
   DIDS, a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger which also mediates phosphate and
   arsenate transport in erythrocytes. In parallel with the increase in
   extracellular NPSH levels, significant increases in extracellular
   glutathione levels were detected following exposure to vanadate.
   Extracellular glutathione levels reached to 0.0150 +/- 0.0.001, 0.0330
   +/- 0.001, and 0.0576 +/- 0.002 mu mol/ml erythrocyte with 1, 5, and 10
   mM of vanadate respectively. Dimercaptosuccinic acid treatment of
   supematants significantly increased the glutathione levels measured in
   the extracellular media. Utilization of MK571 an MRP inhibitor decreased
   the rate of glutathione efflux from erythrocytes suggesting a role for
   this membrane transporter in the process. A known methylation inhibitor
   periodate oxidized adenosine decreased the rate of glutathione efflux
   from erythrocytes. This observed decrease in extracellular GSH levels
   suggests that GSH release partly requires a proper cellular methylation
   process and that part of GSH detected in the extracellular media may
   arise from GSH-vandium complexes. The results of the present study
   indicate that human erythrocyte efflux glutathione in reduced free form
   and in conjugated form/s that can be recovered with dimercaptosuccinic
   acid when exposed to vanadate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI High Vitamin D Status in Younger Individuals Is Associated with Low
   Circulating Thyrotropin
SO THYROID
AB Background: Vitamin D is an immunomodulator and may affect autoimmune
   thyroid diseases. Vitamin D has also been shown to influence thyrocytes
   directly by attenuating thyrotropin (TSH)-stimulated iodide uptake and
   cell growth. However, it is unclear how vitamin D status is related to
   TSH at the population level. The goal of the present study was to
   investigate the relationship between vitamin D status and TSH levels
   according to thyroid autoantibodies in a population-based health survey
   in Thailand.
   Methods: A total of 2582 adults, aged 15-98 years, were randomly
   selected according to the geographical region from the Thailand 4th
   National Health Examination Survey sample. By study design, the sexes
   were equally represented. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)
   D], TSH, the thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and the thyroglobulin
   antibody (TgAb) were measured in all subjects.
   Results: The mean age was 55.0 +/- 0.4 (SE) years. In subjects positive
   for serum TgAb, serum TSH levels were higher, whereas total serum
   25(OH)D levels were lower. In addition, the prevalence of vitamin D
   insufficiency in TgAb-positive subjects was significantly higher than
   that observed in TPOAb- and TgAb-negative subjects, whether based on
   cutoff values of 20 or 30 ng/mL: 8.3% vs. 5.6%, p < 0.05; or 47.6% vs.
   42.0%, p < 0.05, respectively. However, vitamin D status was not
   associated with positive TPOAb and/or TgAb after controlling for sex and
   age. To explore the probable interaction between vitamin D status and
   age on serum TSH, analyses were performed according to age tertiles; it
   was found that higher 25(OH)D levels were independently associated with
   lower TSH, but only in subjects in the lowest age tertile.
   Conclusions: This population-based study showed that high vitamin D
   status in younger individuals is associated with low circulating TSH.

TI ARID1a-DNA Interactions Are Required for Promoter Occupancy by SWI/SNF
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB Every known SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex incorporates an ARID
   DNA binding domain-containing subunit. Despite being a ubiquitous
   component of the complex, physiological roles for this domain remain
   undefined. Here, we show that disruption of ARID1a-DNA binding in mice
   results in embryonic lethality, with mutant embryos manifesting
   prominent defects in the heart and extraembryonic vasculature. The DNA
   binding-defective mutant ARID1a subunit is stably expressed and capable
   of assembling into a SWI/SNF complex with core catalytic properties, but
   nucleosome substrate binding and promoter occupancy by ARID1a-containing
   SWI/SNF complexes (BAF-A) are impaired. Depletion of ARID
   domain-dependent, BAF-A associations at THROMBOSPONDIN 1 (THBS1) led to
   the concomitant upregulation of this SWI/SNF target gene. Using a THBS1
   promoter-reporter gene, we further show that BAF-A directly regulates
   THBS1 promoter activity in an ARID domain-dependent manner. Our data not
   only demonstrate that ARID1a-DNA interactions are physiologically
   relevant in higher eukaryotes but also indicate that these interactions
   facilitate SWI/SNF binding to target sites in vivo. These findings
   support the model wherein cooperative interactions among intrinsic
   subunit-chromatin interaction domains and sequence-specific
   transcription factors drive SWI/SNF recruitment.

TI Effects of butachlor on reproduction and hormone levels in adult
   zebrafish (Danio rerio)
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY
AB Butachlor, a chloracetamide herbicide, is widely used in China. In the
   present study, paired adult male and female zebrafish (Danio rerio) were
   exposed to various concentrations of butachlor (0, 25, 50 and 100 mu
   g/L) for 30 days, and the effects on reproduction and endocrine
   disruption were evaluated using fecundity, condition factor (CF),
   gonadosomatic index (GSI), liver somatic index (LSI), plasma
   vitellogenin (VTG), sex steroids and thyroid hormone levels as
   endpoints. Our results showed that the mean fecundity rates were
   significantly decreased at 50 and 100 mu g/L butachlor during the 30-day
   exposure period. At the end of the exposure period, no significant
   changes were observed in CF and LSI in both females and males, while GSI
   was significantly reduced in males at 50 and 100 mu g/L butachlor. At
   100 mu g/L butachlor, plasma testosterone (T) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2)
   levels were significantly decreased in females, while plasma VTG level
   was significantly increased in males. Plasma thyroxine (T4) and
   triiodothyronine (T3) levels were significantly increased at 50 and 100
   mu g/L butachlor in males, and at 100 mu g/L in females. This work
   demonstrated that butachlor adversely affected the normal reproductive
   success of zebrafish, and disrupted the thyroid and sex steroid
   endocrine systems, which provides the basis for the estimated ecological
   risk during butachlor exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

TI JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways converge on Akt-mediated
   phosphorylation of EZH2 in bronchial epithelial cells induced by arsenic
SO CELL CYCLE
AB The molecular mechanisms by which arsenic (As(3+)) causes human cancers
   remain to be fully elucidated. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the
   catalytic subunit of polycomb-repressive complexes 2 (PRC2) that
   promotes trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3, leading to altered
   expression of tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In the present study, we
   determined the effect of As(3+) on EZH2 phosphorylation and the
   signaling pathways important for As(3+)-induced EZH2 phosphorylation in
   human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. The involvement of kinases
   in As(3+)-induced EZH2 phosphorylation was validated by siRNA-based gene
   silencing. The data showed that As(3+) can induce phosphorylation of
   EZH2 at serine 21 in human bronchial epithelial cells and that the
   phosphorylation of EZH2 requires an As(3+)-activated signaling cascade
   from JNK and STAT3 to Akt. Transfection of the cells with siRNA specific
   for JNK1 revealed that JNK silencing reduced serine727 phosphorylation
   of STAT3, Akt activation and EZH2 phosphorylation, suggesting that JNK
   is the upstream kinase involved in As(3+)-induced EZH2 phosphorylation.
   Because As(3+) is capable of inducing miRNA-21 (miR-21), a
   STAT3-regulated miRNA that represses protein translation of PTEN or
   Spry2, we also tested the role of STAT3 and miR-21 in As(3+)-induced
   EZH2 phosphorylation. Ectopic overexpression of miR-21 promoted Akt
   activation and phosphorylation of EZH2, whereas inhibiting miR-21 by
   transfecting the cells with anti-miR-21 inhibited Akt activation and
   EZH2 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a
   contribution of the JNK, STAT3 and Akt signaling axis to As(3+)-induced
   EZH2 phosphorylation. Importantly, these findings may reveal new
   molecular mechanisms underlying As(3+)-induced carcinogenesis.

TI Phase I study of 5-aza-2 '-deoxycytidine in combination with valproic
   acid in non-small-cell lung cancer
SO CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of lung
   cancer and is the most common cause of cancer death in industrialized
   countries. Epigenetic modifications are observed universally during the
   tumorigenesis of lung cancer. The development of epigenetic-modulating
   agents utilizing the synergism between hypomethylating agents and
   histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors provides a novel therapeutic
   approach in treating NSCLC.
   We performed a phase I trial combining 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
   (decitabine) and valproic acid (VPA), in patients with advanced stage
   NSCLC. Patients were treated with escalating doses of decitabine (5-15
   mg/m(2)) IV for 10 days in combination with VPA (10-20 mg/kg/day) PO on
   days 5-21 of a 28-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   analysis included decitabine pharmacokinetics and fetal hemoglobin
   expression.
   Eight patients were accrued to this phase I study. All patients had
   advanced NSCLC and had received prior chemotherapy. Eastern Cooperative
   Oncology Group performance status was 0-2. Major toxicities included
   myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity was seen in
   two patients suffering grade 3 neurotoxicity during cycle one including
   disorientation, lethargy, memory loss, and ataxia at dose level 1. One
   patient had grade 3 neutropenia at the de-escalated dose. No objective
   response was observed, and stable disease was seen in one patient. Fetal
   hemoglobin levels increased after cycle one in all seven patients with
   evaluable results.
   We observed that decitabine and valproic acid are an effective
   combination in reactivating hypermethylated genes as demonstrated by
   re-expressing fetal hemoglobin. This combination in patients with
   advanced stage IV NSCLC, however, is limited by unacceptable
   neurological toxicity at a relatively low dosage. Combining
   hypomethylating agents with alternative HDAC inhibitors that lack the
   toxicity of VPA should be explored further.

TI Role of Adrenal Glucocorticoid Signaling in Prefrontal Cortex Gene
   Expression and Acute Behavioral Responses to Ethanol
SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background Glucocorticoid hormones modulate acute and chronic behavioral
   and molecular responses to drugs of abuse including psychostimulants and
   opioids. There is growing evidence that glucocorticoids might also
   modulate behavioral responses to ethanol (EtOH ). Acute EtOH activates
   the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis, causing the release of adrenal
   glucocorticoid hormones. Our prior genomic studies suggest that
   glucocorticoids play a role in regulating gene expression in the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) of DBA2/J (D2) mice following acute EtOH
   administration. However, few studies have analyzed the role of
   glucocorticoid signaling in behavioral responses to acute EtOH . Such
   work could be significant, given the predictive value for the level of
   response to acute EtOH in the risk for alcoholism. Methods We studied
   whether the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, RU-486, or
   adrenalectomy (ADX) altered male D2 mouse behavioral responses to acute
   (locomotor activation, anxiolysis, or loss-of-righting reflex [LORR]) or
   repeated (sensitization) EtOH treatment. Whole-genome microarray
   analysis and bioinformatics approaches were used to identify PFC
   candidate genes possibly responsible for altered behavioral responses to
   EtOH following ADX. Results ADX and RU-486 both impaired acute EtOH (2
   g/kg)-induced locomotor activation in D2 mice without affecting basal
   locomotor activity. However, neither ADX nor RU-486 altered the
   initiation of EtOH sensitization (locomotor activation or jump counts),
   EtOH -induced anxiolysis, or LORR. ADX mice showed microarray gene
   expression changes in PFC that significantly overlapped with acute EtOH
   -responsive gene sets derived by our prior microarray studies. Q-rtPCR
   analysis verified that ADX decreased PFC expression of Fkbp5 while
   significantly increasing Gpr6 expression. In addition, high-dose RU-486
   pretreatment blunted EtOH -induced Fkbp5 expression. Conclusions Our
   studies suggest that EtOH 's activation of adrenal glucocorticoid
   release and subsequent GR activation may partially modulate EtOH 's
   acute locomotor activation in male D2 mice. Furthermore, because adrenal
   glucocorticoid basal tone regulated PFC gene expression, including a
   significant set of acute EtOH -responsive genes, this suggests that
   glucocorticoid-regulated PFC gene expression may be an important factor
   modulating acute behavioral responses to EtOH .

TI Toward Thermoplastic Lignin Polymers; Part II: Thermal & Polymer
   Characteristics of Kraft Lignin & Derivatives
SO BIORESOURCES
AB This work focused on providing a molecular understanding of the way the
   polymeric properties of kraft lignin and its derivatives are affected by
   various thermal treatments. This information was then correlated with
   the polymeric properties of the materials (glass transition temperature
   (T(g)), molecular weight characteristics, and thermal stability) for a
   series of selectively and progressively derivatized softwood kraft
   lignin samples. Softwood kraft lignin was highly susceptible to
   thermally induced reactions that caused its molecular characteristics to
   be severely altered with the concomitant formation of irreversible
   cross-linking. However, by fully methylating the phenolic OH groups from
   within the structure of softwood kraft lignin, the thermal stability of
   these materials was dramatically enhanced and their T(g) reduced. While
   optimum thermal stability and melt re-cycling was observed with the
   fully methylated derivatives, fully oxypropylated phenolic substitution
   did not offer the same possibilities. The accumulated data is aimed at
   providing the foundations for a rational design of single component,
   lignin-based thermoplastic materials with reproducible polymeric
   properties when thermally processed in a number of manufacturing cycles.

TI An Unusual Giant Cell Tumor of the Thyroid: Case Report and Review of
   the Literature
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Bone giant cell tumors (GCTs) are among the most common benign
   bone tumors and affect mostly young patients. They represent a rare
   etiology of head and neck cancer.
   Objective: We report the case of a 38-yr-old male with a GCT of the
   thyroid cartilage, initially treated as a thyroid cancer.
   Case Illustration: The patient had incomplete initial surgery, and a
   substantial tumor residue was observed at postoperative morphological
   evaluation. Given the potential risks associated with complete
   definitive surgery and recent data supporting the use of the receptor
   activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand inhibitor, we proposed
   treatment with denosumab. Three months after initiating denosumab,
   computed tomography scan imaging showed a significant modification of
   the lesion with several calcifications. The patient underwent partial
   laryngectomy, and examination of the surgical specimen revealed a
   complete histological response.
   Results: A review of the literature was conducted to identify previous
   studies pertaining to GCTs, focusing on reports related to their
   management.
   Conclusion: Denosumab emerges as a new treatment for patients with GCTs.
   Additional clinical trial data are needed to establish the real efficacy
   and long-term safety of this treatment for the management of GCT. (J

   or the nearby STX16, but the molecular mechanism of the GNAS imprinting
   defects in sporadic PHP1b cases remains elusive.
   Objective: We investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of GNAS
   imprinting defects in two patients with sporadic PHP1b.
   Results: We identified paternal uniparental disomy of the long arm of
   chromosome 20 (patUPD20) in two unrelated patients with sporadic PHP1b.
   This provides an explanation for the patients' GNAS methylation
   abnormalities and hormone resistance. Our data and a review of the six
   published cases of patUPD20 suggest that high birth weight and/or
   early-onset obesity and macrocephaly may also represent features of
   patUPD20.
   Conclusion: We suggest that patUPD20 should be considered in the
   evaluation of patients with sporadic PHP1b. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98:

TI Deciphering the epigenetic network in colorectal cancer
SO JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB The sequential accumulation of genetic alterations has been classically
   considered responsible for the origin and subsequent progression of
   colorectal cancer, although recent cumulative data provide strong
   evidence of the significance of epigenetic changes in the development of
   this multi-step malignancy. Among the epigenetic alterations, miRNAs
   deregulation has emerged as an exciting and promising field in cancer
   research. In a recent issue of the Journal of Pathology, Wang and
   colleagues identify miR-149 as being silenced by methylation in
   colorectal cancer. The authors also identified Sp1 as a target of
   miR-149. These intriguing observations have important biological

TI Increased Detection of Non-recurrent Inferior Laryngeal Nerve (NRLN)
   During Thyroid Surgery Using Systematic Intraoperative Neuromonitoring
   (IONM)
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NRLN) is a rare anatomical
   variant with a reported incidence of 0.6-1.3 %. It carries a higher risk
   of palsy during thyroid surgery. Its detection is mandatory in order to
   avoid such complication.
   Systematic intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) was carried out for 806
   consecutive nerve at risk (NAR) patients in two centers (Lille and
   Varese). In 402 patients surgery to the right side was performed with
   IONM. The IONM of the inferior laryngeal nerve (ILN) was conducted as
   recommended by international guidelines (V1/R1/V2/R2).
   A NRLN was detected in 11 of 402 NAR (2.7 %). In the first center
   (Lille) the incidence of NRLN was 6.0 % (7/117). No loss of signal (LOS)
   was reported in this group of patients. Postoperative laryngoscopy was
   normal in all patients with NRLN.
   The true incidence of NRLN may be higher than expected. Neurophysiology
   helps the surgeon to better understand the anatomy and function of
   nervous structures. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is a useful tool that
   should be systematically implemented in thyroid surgery to better
   understand the anatomy and physiology of the inferior laryngeal nerve.
   Its use may allow the surgeon to decrease the incidence of nerve palsy
   especially in case of NRLN. The IONM adjunct does not add significantly
   to the costs for thyroid surgery.

TI Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in the free-ranging
   bandicoots (Perameles nasuta and Isoodon obesulus) of northern Sydney
SO AUSTRALIAN MAMMALOGY
AB Knowledge of how animals cope with their environment is fundamental to
   the management of free-ranging populations. Urban animals face increased
   competition for resources, habitat fragmentation and predation. These
   pressures may impact an individual's welfare by releasing glucocorticoid
   hormones in the blood through a response from the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in altered energy storage
   and utilisation. This study aimed to determine the applicability of
   measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in free-ranging bandicoots
   by using a simple enzyme immunoassay. We used long-nosed and southern
   brown bandicoots in northern Sydney to investigate whether environmental
   and demographic variables can influence faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolites. Long-nosed bandicoots showed similar faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite concentrations between suburban backyards and National Park
   populations. Higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were recorded in
   female southern brown bandicoots than in males, whilst female and male
   long-nosed bandicoots had similar glucocorticoid metabolite levels.
   Ectoparasite load, body condition and season did not influence faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites. This non-invasive method has a broad
   application and can be used to provide biological information to guide
   management of populations within a conservation context.

TI Inhibitory Function of the Dorsomedial Hypothalamic Nucleus on the
   Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Response to an Emotional Stressor
   but not Immune Challenge
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Accumulating evidence implicates the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus
   (DMH) in the regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine stress
   responses. However, although projections from the DMH to the
   paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), which is the critical site
   of the neuroendocrine stress axis, have been described, the impact of
   DMH neurones in the modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   axis activation during stress is not fully understood. The present study
   aimed to investigate the role of the DMH in HPA axis responses to
   different types of stimuli. Male Sprague-Dawley rats fitted with a
   chronic jugular venous catheter were exposed to either an emotional
   stressor (elevated platform-exposure) or immune challenge (systemic
   interleukin-1 beta administration). Bilateral electrolytic lesions of
   the DMH disinhibited HPA axis responses to the emotional stressor, as
   indicated by higher plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels during
   and after elevated platform exposure in lesioned animals compared to
   sham-lesioned controls. Moreover, DMH-lesioned animals showed increased
   neuronal activation in the PVN, as indicated by a higher c-Fos
   expression after elevated-platform exposure compared to controls. By
   contrast, DMH-lesions had no effects on HPA axis responses to immune
   challenge. Taken together, our data suggest an inhibitory role of DMH
   neurones on stress-induced HPA axis activation that is dependent upon
   the nature of the stimulus being important in response to an emotional
   stressor but not to immune challenge.

TI Alterations of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling subunit-BRG1 and BRM in
   hepatocellular carcinoma
SO LIVER INTERNATIONAL
AB Background The SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, which contains
   either brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1) or brahma (BRM) as the catalytic
   ATPase, functions as a master regulator of gene expression. Aims To
   examine alterations of BRG1 and BRM in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Methods We investigated DNA copy number aberrations in human HCC cell
   lines using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray. We determined DNA
   copy numbers and expression levels of BRG1 and BRM genes in primary HCC
   tumours, and conducted further searches for mutations in BRG1 and BRM
   genes. Results Homozygous deletion of the BRG1 gene was found in HCC
   cell line SNU398. Copy number losses of BRG1 and BRM genes were observed
   in 14 (26%) and 7 (13%) of 54 primary HCC tumours respectively. We found
   four somatic missense mutations in the BRG1 gene in two of 36 primary
   HCC tumours, but no mutations in BRM gene. Expression of BRM mRNA, but
   not BRG1 mRNA, was significantly reduced in primary HCC tumours,
   compared to non-tumour tissue counterparts. Immunohistochemical analyses
   of non-tumour liver tissues showed that BRM protein was expressed in
   hepatocytes and bile-duct epithelial cells, whereas BRG1 protein was
   expressed in bile-duct epithelial cells, but not in hepatocytes. BRM
   protein expression was lost in nine (22.5%) of 40 HCC tumours. Loss of
   BRM protein expression was significantly associated with poor overall
   survival. Conclusion Reduced expression of BRM may contribute to the
   carcinogenesis of HCC. Although deletions and mutations in BRG1 gene
   were identified, the role of BRG1 in HCC tumourigenesis remains unclear.

TI Strabismus After Inferior-Medial Wall Orbital Decompression in
   Thyroid-Related Orbitopathy
SO CURRENT EYE RESEARCH
AB Purpose: To evaluate the rate and pattern of new-onset diplopia after
   inferior-medial wall orbital decompression in thyroid-related
   orbitopathy (TRO) patients.
   Methods: Medical records of TRO patients who underwent orbital floor and
   medial wall decompression at the Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba
   Medical Center between 1/1986 and 12/2007 were reviewed and analyzed.
   Main outcome measures: primary-and down-gaze diplopia, strabismus (prism
   diopter [PD]).
   Results: Fifty-one TRO patients (30 females, mean age of 51 years)
   underwent 102 bilateral inferior-medial wall orbital decompressions.
   Preoperatively, 29 patients (57%) reported primary gaze diplopia. Of
   these, 13 patients (45%) had persistent or worsened diplopia
   postoperatively, all of which required strabismus surgery. Fifteen
   patients had no primary gaze diplopia preoperatively. Of these, five
   patients (33%) had new-onset diplopia postoperatively, and only one
   patient (7%) required strabismus surgery. No data regarding preexisting
   diplopia were available in seven patients. Orbital decompression had a
   significant effect on horizontal ocular deviations with increasing
   esotropic shift. Primary position esotropia increased from 11.1
   (+/-22.5) PD preoperatively to 23.8 (+/-20.5) PD after surgery (p =
   0.01, paired samples t-test). No severe complications were encountered
   in this group of patients.
   Conclusions: Inferior-medial wall orbital decompression is associated
   with a relatively high rate of new-onset diplopia of up to 33%. Patients
   with pre-existing primary and/or downgaze diplopia are more likely to
   have persistent symptoms postoperatively that may require strabismus
   surgery.

TI Processing of snoRNAs as a new source of regulatory non-coding RNAs
SO BIOESSAYS
AB Recent experimental evidence suggests that most of the genome is
   transcribed into non-coding RNAs. The initial transcripts undergo
   further processing generating shorter, metabolically stable RNAs with
   diverse functions. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are non-coding RNAs
   that modify rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs that were considered stable. We
   review evidence that snoRNAs undergo further processing. High-throughput
   sequencing and RNase protection experiments showed widespread expression
   of snoRNA fragments, known as snoRNA-derived RNAs (sdRNAs). Some sdRNAs
   resemble miRNAs, these can associate with argonaute proteins and
   influence translation. Other sdRNAs are longer, form complexes with
   hnRNPs and influence gene expression. C/D box snoRNA fragmentation
   patterns are conserved across multiple cell types, suggesting a
   processing event, rather than degradation. The loss of expression from
   genetic loci that generate canonical snoRNAs and processed snoRNAs
   results in diseases, such as Prader-Willi Syndrome, indicating possible
   physiological roles for processed snoRNAs. We propose that processed
   snoRNAs acquire new roles in gene expression and represent a new class
   of regulatory RNAs distinct from canonical snoRNAs. Also watch the Video

TI Cellular Signaling Pathway Alterations and Potential Targeted Therapies
   for Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Parafollicular C-cell-derived medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) comprises
   3% to 4% of all thyroid cancers. While cytotoxic treatments have been
   shown to have limited efficacy, targeted molecular therapies that
   inhibit rearranged during transfection (RET) and other tyrosine kinase
   receptors that are mainly involved in angiogenesis have shown great
   promise in the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced MTC.
   Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as vandetanib, which is already
   approved for the treatment of progressive MTC, and cabozantinib have
   shown distinct advantages with regard to rates of disease response and
   control. However, these types of tyrosine kinase inhibitor compounds are
   able to concurrently block several types of targets, which limits the
   understanding of RET as a specific target. Moreover, important
   resistances to tyrosine kinase inhibitors can occur, which limit the
   long-term efficacy of these treatments. Deregulated cellular signaling
   pathways and genetic alterations in MTC, particularly the activation of
   the RAS/mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) cascades and RET crosstalk
   signaling, are now emerging as novel and potentially promising
   therapeutic treatments for aggressive MTC.

TI Loss of Hfe Leads to Progression of Tumor Phenotype in Primary Retinal
   Pigment Epithelial Cells
SO INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE
AB PURPOSE. Hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload arising mostly
   from mutations in HFE. HFE is expressed in retinal pigment epithelium
   (RPE), and Hfe(-/-) mice develop age-related iron accumulation and
   retinal degeneration associated with RPE hyperproliferation. Here, the
   mechanism underlying the hyperproliferative phenotype in RPE was
   investigated.
   METHODS. Cellular senescence was monitored by beta-galactosidase
   activity. Gene expression was monitored by real-time PCR. Survivin was
   analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Migration and invasion
   were monitored using appropriate kits. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) were
   monitored by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake. Histone deacetylases (HDACs)
   were studied by monitoring catalytic activity and acetylation status of
   histones H3/H4.
   RESULTS. Hfe(-/-) RPE cells exhibited slower senescence rate and higher
   survivin expression than wild type cells. Hfe(-/-) cells migrated faster
   and showed greater glucose uptake and increased expression of GLUTs. The
   expression of HDACs and DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) also was
   increased. Similarly, RPE cells from hemojuvelin (Hjv)-knockout mice,
   another model of hemochromatosis, also had increased expression of
   GLUTs, HDACs, and DNMTs. The expression of Slc5a8 was decreased in
   Hfe(-/-) RPE cells, but treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor
   restored the transporter expression, indicating involvement of DNA
   methylation in the silencing of Slc5a8 in Hfe(-/-) cells.
   CONCLUSIONS. RPE cells from iron-overloaded mice exhibit several
   features of tumor cells: decreased senescence, enhanced migration,
   increased glucose uptake, and elevated levels of HDACs and DNMTs. These
   features are seen in Hfe(-/-) RPE cells as well as in Hjv(-/-) RPE
   cells, providing a molecular basis for the hyperproliferative phenotype
   of Hfe(-/-) and Hjv(-/-) RPE cells. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2013;

TI microRNA-29b is a novel mediator of Sox2 function in the regulation of
   somatic cell reprogramming
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB Fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs) by the application of Yamanaka factors (OSKM), but the
   mechanisms underlying this reprogramming remain poorly understood. Here,
   we report that Sox2 directly regulates endogenous microRNA-29b (miR-29b)
   expression during iPSC generation and that miR-29b expression is
   required for OSKM- and OSK-mediated reprogramming. Mechanistic studies
   show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are in vivo targets of miR-29b and that
   Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression is inversely correlated with miR-29b
   expression during reprogramming. Moreover, the effect of miR-29b on
   reprogramming can be blocked by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b overexpression. Further
   experiments indicate that miR-29b-DNMT signaling is significantly
   involved in the regulation of DNA methylation-related reprogramming
   events, such as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and Dlk1-Dio3
   region transcription. Thus, our studies not only reveal that miR-29b is
   a novel mediator of reprogramming factor Sox2 but also provide evidence
   for a multistep mechanism in which Sox2 drives a miR-29b-DNMT signaling
   axis that regulates DNA methylation-related events during reprogramming.

TI Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) HBO1 and JADE1 in Epithelial Cell
   Regeneration
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB HBO1 acetylates lysine residues of histones and is involved in DNA
   replication and gene transcription. Two isoforms of JADE1, JADE1S and
   JADE1L, bind HBO1 and promote acetylation of histones in chromatin
   context. We characterized the role of JADE1-HBO1 complexes in vitro and
   in vivo during epithelial cell replication. Down-regulation of JADE1 by
   siRNA diminished the rate of DNA synthesis in cultured cells, decreased
   endogenous HBO1 protein expression, and prevented chromatin recruitment
   of replication factor Mcm7, demonstrating that JADE1 is required for
   cell proliferation. We used a murine model of acute kidney injury to
   examine expression of HBO1-JADE1S/L in injured and regenerating
   epithelial tissue. In control kidneys, JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 were
   expressed in nuclei of proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells.
   Ischemia and reperfusion injury resulted in an initial decrease in
   JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 protein levels, which returned to baseline
   during renal recovery. HBO1 and JADE1S recovered as cell proliferation
   reached its maximum, whereas JADE1L recovered after bulk proliferation
   had ceased. The temporal expression of JADE1S correlated with the
   acetylation of histone H4 on Lysines 5 and 12, but not with acetylation
   of histone H3 on lysine 14, demonstrating that the JADE1S-HBO1 complex
   specifically marks H4 during epithelial cell proliferation. These data
   implicate JADE1-HBO1 complex in acute kidney injury and suggest distinct
   roles for JADE1 isoforms during epithelial cell recovery. (Am J Pathol

TI The endocrinology of male rhesus macaque social and reproductive status:
   a test of the challenge and social stress hypotheses
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB Social status primarily determines male mammalian reproductive success,
   and hypotheses on the endocrinology of dominance have stimulated
   unprecedented investigation of its costs and benefits. Under the
   challenge hypothesis, male testosterone levels rise according to
   competitive need, while the social stress hypothesis predicts
   glucocorticoid (GC) rises in high-ranking individuals during social
   unrest. Periods of social instability in group-living primates,
   primarily in baboons, provide evidence for both hypotheses, but data on
   social instability in seasonally breeding species with marked social
   despotism but lower reproductive skew are lacking. We tested these
   hypotheses in seasonally breeding rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago,
   Puerto Rico. We documented male fecal GC and androgen levels over a
   10-month period in relation to rank, age, natal status, and group tenure
   length, including during a socially unstable period in which coalitions
   of lower ranked males attacked higher ranked males. Androgen, but not
   GC, levels rose during the mating season; older males had lower birth
   season levels but underwent a greater inter-season rise than younger
   males. Neither endocrine measure was related to rank except during
   social instability, when higher ranked individuals had higher and more
   variable levels of both. High-ranking male targets had the highest GC
   levels of all males when targeted and also had high and variable GC and
   androgen levels across the instability period. Our results provide
   evidence for both the challenge and social stress hypotheses.

TI CRL4(CDT2) Targets CHK1 for PCNA-Independent Destruction
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB CDT2 targets proteins involved in replication licensing (CDT1), cell
   cycle control (p21), and chromatin modification (SET8) for destruction
   by the CUL4-based E3 ligase (CRL4).CRL4(CDT2) recruits these substrates
   through interactions with chromatin-bound PCNA and ubiquitinates them
   exclusively on chromatin. Rereplication and G(2) cell cycle arrest are
   observed in CDT2-depleted cells. The rereplication phenotype has been
   attributed to an inability to destroy CDT1, but the molecular target
   important for G(2) cell cycle arrest in CDT2-depleted cells has not been
   identified. Here we identify CHK1 as a novel CRL4(CDT2) substrate and
   demonstrate that CHK1 activity is required for maintaining G(2) arrest
   in CDT2-depleted cells. We demonstrate that CRL4(CDT2) targets the
   activated form of CHK1 for destruction in the nucleoplasm rather than on
   chromatin and that this occurs in a PCNA-independent manner. Although
   both CRL1 and CRL4 ubiquitinate CHK1, we report that they bind CHK1 in
   distinct cellular compartments. Our study provides insight into how
   elevated CDT2 expression levels may provide tumors with a proliferative
   advantage.

TI Variable imprinting of the MEST gene in human preimplantation embryos
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
AB There is evidence that expression and methylation of the imprinted
   paternally expressed gene 1/mesoderm-specific transcript homologue
   (PEG1/MEST) gene may be affected by assisted reproductive technologies
   (ARTs) and infertility. In this study, we sought to assess the

   adverse effects of ART and infertility on this locus in early human

   these embryos. In 10 heterozygous embryos, MEST expression was
   monoallelic in seven embryos, predominantly monoallelic in two embryos,
   and biallelic in one embryo. Screening of cDNA derived from 61
   additional human preimplantation embryos, for which DNA for genotyping
   was unavailable, identified eight embryos with expression originating
   from both alleles (biallelic or predominantly monoallelic). In some
   embryos, therefore, the onset of imprinted MEST expression occurs during
   late preimplantation development. Variability in MEST imprinting was
   observed in both in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection-derived embryos. Biallelic or predominantly monoallelic MEST
   expression was not associated with any one cause of infertility.
   Characterisation of the main MEST isoforms revealed that isoform 2 was
   detected in early development and was itself variably imprinted between
   embryos. To our knowledge, this report constitutes the largest
   expression study to date of genomic imprinting in human preimplantation
   embryos and reveals that for some imprinted genes, contrasting
   imprinting states exist between embryos. European Journal of Human

TI Basic mechanisms of RNA polymerase II activity and alteration of gene
   expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and all RNA polymerases for
   that matter, may be understood as comprising two cycles. The first cycle
   relates to the basic mechanism of the transcription process wherein
   Poll! must select the appropriate nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)
   substrate complementary to the DNA template, catalyze phosphodiester
   bond formation, and translocate to the next position on the DNA
   template. Performing this cycle in an iterative fashion allows the
   synthesis of RNA chains that can be over one million nucleotides in
   length in some larger eukaryotes. Overlaid upon this enzymatic cycle,
   transcription may be divided into another cycle of three phases:
   initiation, elongation, and termination. Each of these phases has a
   large number of associated transcription factors that function to
   promote or regulate the gene expression process. Complicating matters,
   each phase of the latter transcription cycle are coincident with
   cotranscriptional RNA processing events. Additionally, transcription
   takes place within a highly dynamic and regulated chromatin environment
   This chromatin environment is radically impacted by active transcription
   and associated chromatin modifications and remodeling, while also
   functioning as a major platform for Pot II regulation. This review will
   focus on our basic knowledge of the Poll! transcription mechanism, and
   how altered Pol II activity impacts gene expression in vivo in the model
   eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This article is part of a Special
   Issue entitled: RNA Polymerase II Transcript Elongation. (C) 2012

TI CCAAT/Enhancer-binding Protein-Homologous Protein Sensitizes to SU5416
   by Modulating p21 and PI3K/Akt Signal Pathway in FRO Anaplastic Thyroid
   Carcinoma Cells
SO HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH
AB SU5416, vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor inhibitor,
   suppresses hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, growth, proliferation, and
   metastasis in cancer cells. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous
   protein (CHOP) has pivotal roles in regulation of growth and survival.
   In the present study, we evaluated the effects of SU5416 on cell
   survival, p21, and PI3K/Akt signal pathway in FRO anaplastic thyroid
   carcinoma (ATC) cells. Moreover, we investigated the roles of CHOP in
   cell survival under condition of SU5416 treatment in FRO ATC cells.
   After SU5416 treatment, cell viability, PARP-1, and caspase-3 protein
   levels were not changed. p53 and p27 protein levels decreased while p21
   protein levels increased. Phospho-Akt protein levels were not altered.
   In SU5416-treated situation, cell viability was not different before and
   after administration of either p21 siRNA or LY294002 whereas it was
   lessened after co-administration of p21 siRNA and LY294002. Compared to
   SU5416 treatment alone, cell viability was reduced with CHOP plasmid but
   it was unchanged with CHOP siRNA. PARP-1 and caspase-3 protein levels
   with CHOP plasmid were elevated whereas the protein levels with CHOP
   siRNA were similar. While CHOP plasmid transfection diminished p21 and
   phospho-Akt protein levels, CHOP siRNA transfection did not alter the
   protein levels. In conclusion, these results suggest that CHOP may
   sensitize FRO ATC cells to SU5416 thereby inhibiting cell survival by
   modulating p21 and PI3K/Akt signal pathway. Furthermore, these findings
   imply that CHOP may be a possible candidate as the chemosensitizing
   factor for induction of cytotoxicity in ATC cells exposed to SU5416.

TI In Vitro Perturbations of Targets in Cancer Hallmark Processes Predict
   Rodent Chemical Carcinogenesis
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Thousands of untested chemicals in the environment require efficient
   characterization of carcinogenic potential in humans. A proposed
   solution is rapid testing of chemicals using in vitro high-throughput
   screening (HTS) assays for targets in pathways linked to disease
   processes to build models for priority setting and further testing. We
   describe a model for predicting rodent carcinogenicity based on HTS data
   from 292 chemicals tested in 672 assays mapping to 455 genes. All data
   come from the EPA ToxCast project. The model was trained on a subset of
   232 chemicals with in vivo rodent carcinogenicity data in the Toxicity
   Reference Database (ToxRefDB). Individual HTS assays strongly associated
   with rodent cancers in ToxRefDB were linked to genes, pathways, and
   hallmark processes documented to be involved in tumor biology and cancer
   progression. Rodent liver cancer endpoints were linked to
   well-documented pathways such as peroxisome proliferatoractivated
   receptor signaling and TP53 and novel targets such as PDE5A and PLAUR.
   Cancer hallmark genes associated with rodent thyroid tumors were found
   to be linked to human thyroid tumors and autoimmune thyroid disease. A
   model was developed in which these genes/pathways function as
   hypothetical enhancers or promoters of rat thyroid tumors, acting
   secondary to the key initiating event of thyroid hormone disruption. A
   simple scoring function was generated to identify chemicals with
   significant in vitro evidence that was predictive of in vivo
   carcinogenicity in different rat tissues and organs. This scoring
   function was applied to an external test set of 33 compounds with
   carcinogenicity classifications from the EPA's Office of Pesticide
   Programs and successfully (p = 0.024) differentiated between chemicals
   classified as possible/probable/likely carcinogens and those designated
   as not likely or with evidence of noncarcinogenicity. This model
   represents a chemical carcinogenicity prioritization tool supporting
   targeted testing and functional validation of cancer pathways.

TI Epigenetics and miRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple
   sclerosis
SO TRENDS IN MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB The risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on both genetic
   and environmental factors. Although the genetic susceptibility to MS has
   been investigated in great detail, reports describing epigenetic changes
   in the context of MS have only recently appeared. Epigenetic changes to
   DNA influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA
   sequence. DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA-associated
   silencing are the three most important epigenetic mechanisms that
   influence gene expression. In this review, we summarize recent studies
   investigating epigenetic changes and miRNA as biomarkers for diagnosing
   MS and predicting disease course or treatment response. We also discuss
   how the current studies address important clinical questions and how
   future studies could be designed to best inform clinical practice.

TI Year-round territorial aggression is independent of plasma DHEA in the
   European nuthatch Sitta europaea
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Plasma testosterone can play an important role in promoting aggressive
   behaviors relating to territory defense in breeding male birds. Some
   birds defend territories also during the non-breeding phase, when
   testosterone circulates at basal levels. In such species, plasma levels
   of the pro-hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may support
   non-breeding territoriality by acting as a local substrate for sex
   steroids. To test this possible role of plasma DHEA, we examined the
   seasonal DHEA profile of male (and female) European nuthatches Sitta
   europaea: a male and female nuthatch pair will defend an all-purpose
   territory throughout the year. We hypothesized that plasma DHEA would be
   detectable in wintering nuthatches with a territory. However, only ca.
   half of the territorial wintering males (and females) displayed
   detectable DHEA levels, suggesting that plasma DHEA is not a major sex
   steroid precursor during non-breeding. Further, among hatching-year
   birds, plasma DHEA was significantly lower in territorial birds than in
   "floaters", i.e., subordinate birds without a territory. To
   experimentally examine the role of DHEA in non-breeding territoriality,
   we treated adult wintering males with DHEA and measured effects on
   aggressive responses to conspecific challenge. DHEA treatment elevated
   plasma levels of DHEA (and testosterone), but did not enhance
   territorial behaviors or their persistence. Taken together, our data
   suggest that DHEA (and, indeed, sex steroids per se) do not regulate
   non-breeding territoriality in the nuthatch. Given that territorial
   aggression in nuthatches is expressed year-round, a hormone for its
   activation may be redundant (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Discovery of Cell Compartment Specific Protein-Protein Interactions
   using Affinity Purification Combined with Tandem Mass Spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Affinity purification combined with tandem mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS)
   is a well-established method used to discover interaction partners for a
   given protein of interest. Because most AP-MS/MS approaches are
   performed using the soluble fraction of whole cell extracts (WCE),
   information about the cellular compartments where the interactions occur
   is lost. More importantly, classical AP-MS/MS often fails to identify
   interactions that take place in the nonsoluble fraction of the cell, for
   example, on the chromatin or membranes; consequently, protein complexes
   that are less soluble are underrepresented. In this paper, we introduce
   a method called multiple cell compartment AP-MS/MS (MCC-AP-MS/MS), which
   identifies the interactions of a protein independently in three
   fractions of the cell: the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm, and the
   chromatin. We show that this fractionation improves the sensitivity of
   the method when compared to the classical affinity purification
   procedure using soluble WCE while keeping a very high specificity. Using
   three proteins known to localize in various cell compartments as baits,
   the CDK9 subunit of transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, the RNA
   polymerase II (RNAP II)-associated protein 4 (RPAP4), and the largest
   subunit of RNAP II, POLR2A, we show that MCC-AP-MS/MS reproducibly
   yields fraction-specific interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that this
   improvement in sensitivity leads to the discovery of novel interactions
   of RNAP II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) interacting domain (CID)
   proteins with POLR2A.

TI ROS1 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, a Druggable Target, is Frequently
   Overexpressed in Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinomas Via Genetic and
   Epigenetic Mechanisms
SO ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Microarray analyses have revealed significantly elevated expression of
   the proto-oncogene ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase in 20-30 % of non-small
   cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Selective and potent ROS1 kinase
   inhibitors have recently been developed and oncogenic rearrangement of
   ROS1 in NSCLC identified.
   We performed immunohistochemical evaluation of expression of ROS1 kinase
   and its downstream molecules in 399 NSCLC cases. ROS1 expression in
   primary and recurring lesions of 92 recurrent NSCLC cases was
   additionally analyzed. To elucidate mechanism of expression, two
   ROS1-nonexpressing NSCLC cell lines (Calu6 and H358) and fresh frozen
   tissues from 28 consecutive NSCLC patients were examined for ROS1
   promoter methylation status and ROS1 expression.
   Overall expression rate of ROS1 was 22 % (19 % for adenocarcinomas and
   25 % for nonadenocarcinomas) in NSCLC. ROS1 expression was a worse
   prognostic factor for overall survival in adenocarcinomas of stage I
   NSCLC. In recurred NSCLC, ROS1 expression was significantly higher in
   recurring tumors (38 %) than primary tumors (19 %). Two NSCLC cell lines
   showed increased ROS1 expression after treatment with
   5-aza-2'deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A. Among the 14
   adenocarcinomas examined, two (14 %) showed more than twice the level of
   ROS1 expression in tumor tissue than was observed in matched normal
   tissue and statistically significant differences in the ROS1 promoter
   methylation level.
   A subset of NSCLC revealed overexpression of ROS1 receptor tyrosine
   kinase, possibly in relation to epigenetic changes. ROS1 expression was
   an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in adenocarcinomas
   of stage I NSCLC. Further studies are needed to validate our results.

TI Treatment of upper eyelid retraction related to thyroid-associated

SO GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB To evaluate the efficacy of subconjunctival triamcinolone injection for
   treating upper eyelid retraction caused by thyroid-associated
   ophthalmopathy (TAO).
   Prospective single blind randomized clinical trial. Patients diagnosed
   with TAO-associated eyelid retraction and/or swelling < 6 months before
   study onset were randomly assigned to triamcinolone-injected (group I;
   55 patients, 75 eyes) or observation-only (group II; 40 patients, 59
   eyes) populations. Group I received 1-3 injections of 20 mg
   triamcinolone acetate into the subconjunctival eyelid, between the
   conjunctiva and Muller's muscle, at 3-week intervals. Group I was
   followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 24 weeks post-injection, and group II was
   evaluated at 9 and 24 weeks after initial visit. Eyelid swelling and
   retraction were each graded on a 0-3 scale. Treatment was stopped after
   1-2 injections if both swelling and retraction resolved completely or if
   retraction and swelling scored 0/1 or 1/0 without functional or cosmetic
   patient concerns. Treatment success was defined at 9 and 24 weeks
   post-injection if eyelids were normal or when treatment was terminated
   because of early clinical resolution. We compared baseline clinical data
   between success and failure group evaluated at 9 and 24 weeks in group
   I, and investigated short-term and long-term success prognostic factor
   using multiple logistic regression analysis in each group I and II.
   Swelling and retraction decreased significantly more in group I than in
   group II. Significantly more eyes had severe swelling (a parts per
   thousand yen grade 2) in group I (67 %) than in group II (34 %) upon
   initial evaluation (p < 0.01); this difference disappeared at 9 and 24
   weeks. Fewer severely retracted eyes were observed in group I than in
   group II at 9 and 24 weeks (p < 0.01). Significantly more eyes in group
   I achieved success at both 9 and 24 weeks (59 %, 75 %) than in group II
   (39 %, 57 %) (p = 0.03, p = 0.04 respectively). Higher initial
   retraction grades (2-3) predicted a higher chance of post-injection
   failure versus the reference group (grade 0-1) at 9 and 24 weeks in
   group I, with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 45.4 (95 % CI = 5.9-351.1, p <
   0.01) and aOR 11.6 (95 % CI = 2.3-58.5, p < 0.01) respectively.
   Similarly in group II, initial retraction grade was associated with the
   failure at 9 and 24 weeks, with aOR 10.3 (95 % CI = 1.8-59.6, p < 0.01)
   and aOR 5.9 (95 % CI = 1.3-25.9, p < 0.05) respectively. Transient
   intraocular pressure elevation was observed in three eyes of two
   patients, although all ocular pressures were normalized within 1 month
   using anti-glaucoma medication.
   Subconjunctival triamcinolone injections were very effective in
   resolving eyelid swelling and retraction in recent-onset TAO. However,
   the symptom-reducing effect of triamcinolone was modest and less
   effective in patients initially presenting with severe retraction
   grades. As intraocular pressure may rise after steroid injection at
   upper eyelid, the treatment should be avoided in patients suspected to
   have glaucoma.

TI The Impact of Ovarian Stimulation on the Expression of Candidate
   Reprogramming Genes in Mouse Preimplantation Embryos
SO CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH
AB Ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins is an integral part of assisted
   reproductive technologies in human subfertility/infertility treatment.
   Recent findings have associated ovarian stimulation with the increased
   incidence of imprinting disorders in humans as well as defects in
   genome-wide methylation reprogramming and, in particular, imprinting in
   mice. Here, we present the first study that determined the impact of
   ovarian stimulation on the expression of developmentally important
   reprogramming genes (Apex1, Lig1, Lig3, Mbd2, Mbd3, Mbd4, and Polb) in
   single early mouse morula embryos (16-cell stage). Using absolute
   quantification of mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR, we observed an
   association of ovarian stimulation with a downregulation of mRNAs
   encoding the base excision repair proteins APEX1 and POLB as well as the
   5-methyl-CpG-binding domain protein MBD3 in individual morula embryos.
   Whole mount immunofluorescence staining of early and late morula embryos
   with an antibody against APEX1 revealed individual embryos with lower
   protein expression levels after ovarian stimulation and a correlation of
   mRNA expression with protein abundance. Our data argue for a negative
   impact of ovarian stimulation during female gametogenesis and/or early
   embryo development affecting the expression of candidate reprogramming
   factors. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Pharmacological effects of 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) in mice include
   facilitation of memory acquisition and retention and reduction of pain
   threshold
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM), an endogenous derivative of thyroid hormones,
   is regarded as a rapid modulator of behaviour and metabolism. To
   determine whether brain thyroid hormone levels contribute to these
   effects, we investigated the effect of central administration of T1AM on
   learning and pain threshold of mice either untreated or pretreated with
   clorgyline (2.5 mg.kg(-1), i.p.), an inhibitor of amine oxidative
   metabolism.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   T1AM (0.13, 0.4, 1.32 and 4 mu g.kg(-1)) or vehicle was injected i.c.v.
   into male mice, and after 30 min their effects on memory acquisition
   capacity, pain threshold and curiosity were evaluated by the following
   tests: passive avoidance, licking latency on the hot plate and movements
   on the hole-board platform. Plasma glycaemia was measured using a
   glucorefractometer. Brain levels of triiodothyroxine (T3), thyroxine
   (T4) and T1AM were measured by HPLC coupled to tandem MS. ERK1/2
   activation and c-fos expression in different brain regions were
   evaluated by Western blot analysis.
   RESULTS
   T1AM improved learning capacity, decreased pain threshold to hot
   stimuli, enhanced curiosity and raised plasma glycaemia in a
   dose-dependent way, without modifying T3 and T4 brain concentrations.
   T1AM effects on learning and pain were abolished or significantly
   affected by clorgyline, suggesting a role for some metabolite(s), or
   that T1AM interacts at the rapid desensitizing target(s). T1AM activated
   ERK in different brain areas at lower doses than those effective on
   behaviour.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   T1AM is a novel memory enhancer. This feature might have important
   implications for the treatment of endocrine and
   neurodegenerative-induced memory disorders.

TI In vivo magnetic resonance microscopy of Drosophilae at 9.4 T
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB In preclinical research, genetic studies have made considerable progress
   as a result of the development of transgenic animal models of human
   diseases. Consequently, there is now a need for higher resolution MRI to
   provide finer details for studies of small animals (rats, mice) or very
   small animals (insects). One way to address this issue is to work with
   high-magnetic-field spectrometers (dedicated to small animal imaging)
   with strong magnetic field gradients. It is also necessary to develop a
   complete methodology (transmit/receive coil, pulse sequence, fixing
   system, air supply, anesthesia capabilities, etc.). In this study, we
   developed noninvasive protocols, both in vitro and in vivo (from coil
   construction to image generation), for drosophila MRI at 9.4 T. The
   10*10*80-mu m resolution makes it possible to visualize whole drosophila
   (head, thorax, abdomen) and internal organs (ovaries, longitudinal and
   transverse muscles, bowel, proboscis, antennae and optical lobes). We
   also provide some results obtained with a Drosophila model of muscle
   degeneration. This opens the way for new applications of structural
   genetic modification studies using MRI of drosophila. (C) 2013 Elsevier

TI Costs of Mounting an Immune Response during Pregnancy in a Lizard
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY
AB Immune defenses are of great benefit to hosts, but reducing the impact
   of infection by mounting an immune response also entails costs. However,
   the physiological mechanisms that generate the costs of an immune
   response remain poorly understood. Moreover, the majority of studies
   investigating the consequences of an immune challenge in vertebrates
   have been conducted on mammals and birds. The aim of this study is to
   investigate the physiological costs of mounting an immune response
   during gestation in an ectothermic species. Indeed, because ectothermic
   species are unable to internally regulate their body temperature, the
   apportionment of resources to homeostatic activities in ectothermic
   species can differ from that in endothermic species. We conducted this
   study on the common lizard Zootoca vivipara. We investigated the costs
   of mounting an immune response by injecting females with sheep red blood
   cells and quantified the consequences to reproductive performance
   (litter mass and success) and physiological performance (standard
   metabolic rate, endurance, and phytohemagglutinin response). In
   addition, we measured basking behavior. Our analyses revealed that
   mounting an immune response affected litter mass, physiological
   performance, and basking behavior. Moreover, we demonstrated that the
   modulation of an immune challenge is impacted by intrinsic factors, such
   as body size and condition.

TI Thyroid hormone is required for hypothalamic neurons regulating
   cardiovascular functions
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Thyroid hormone is well known for its profound direct effects on
   cardiovascular function and metabolism. Recent evidence, however,
   suggests that the hormone also regulates these systems indirectly
   through the central nervous system. While some of the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the hormone's central control of metabolism have
   been identified, its actions in the central cardiovascular control have
   remained enigmatic. Here, we describe a previously unknown population of
   parvalbuminergic neurons in the anterior hypothalamus that requires
   thyroid hormone receptor signaling for proper development. Specific
   stereotaxic ablation of these cells in the mouse resulted in
   hypertension and temperature-dependent tachycardia, indicating a role in
   the central autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate.
   Moreover, the neurons exhibited intrinsic temperature sensitivity in
   patch-clamping experiments, providing a new connection between
   cardiovascular function and core temperature. Thus, the data identify
   what we believe to be a novel hypothalamic cell population potentially
   important for understanding hypertension and indicate developmental
   hypothyroidism as an epigenetic risk factor for cardiovascular
   disorders. Furthermore, the findings may be beneficial for treatment of
   the recently identified patients that have a mutation in thyroid hormone
   receptor alpha 1.

   2013. First published October 23, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00216.2012.-Thyroid hormones (THs) are vital for
   normal postnatal development. Extracellular TH distributor proteins
   create an intravascular reservoir of THs. Transthyretin (TTR) is a TH
   distributor protein in the circulatory system and is the only TH
   distributor protein synthesized in the central nervous system. We
   investigated the phenotype of TTR null mice during development. Total
   and free 3', 5', 3,5-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T(4)) and free 3',
   3,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)) in plasma were significantly reduced in
   14-day-old (P14) TTR null mice. TTR null mice also displayed a delayed
   suckling-to-weaning transition, decreased muscle mass, delayed growth,
   and retarded longitudinal bone growth. In addition, ileums from
   postnatal day 0 (P0) TTR null mice displayed disordered architecture and
   contained fewer goblet cells than wild type. Protein concentrations in
   cerebrospinal fluid from P0 and P14 TTR null mice were higher than in
   age-matched wild-type mice. In contrast to the current literature based
   on analyses of adult TTR null mice, our results demonstrate that TTR has
   an important and nonredundant role in influencing the development of
   several organs.

TI Developmental programming of O(2) sensing by neonatal intermittent
   hypoxia via epigenetic mechanisms
SO RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Recurrent apnea with intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a major clinical
   problem in infants born preterm. Carotid body chemo-reflex and
   catecholamine secretion from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (AMC)
   are important for maintenance of cardio-respiratory homeostasis during
   hypoxia. This article highlights studies on the effects of IH on O(2)
   sensing by the carotid body and AMC in neonatal rodents. Neonatal IH
   augments hypoxia-evoked carotid body sensory excitation and
   catecholamine secretion from AMC which are mediated by reactive oxygen
   species (ROS)-dependent recruitment of endothelin-1 and Ca(2+)
   signaling, respectively. The effects of neonatal IH persist into
   adulthood. Evidence is emerging that neonatal IH initiates epigenetic
   mechanisms involving DNA hypermethylation contributing to long-lasting
   increase in ROS levels. Since adult human subjects born preterm exhibit
   higher incidence of sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension, DNA
   hypomethylating agents might offer a novel therapeutic intervention to
   decrease long-term cardio-respiratory morbidity caused by neonatal IH.

TI Systematic analysis of histone modification readout
SO MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS
AB To faithfully execute diverse biological programs all cells need to
   access and distribute their genomes in a highly organized way. In the
   nucleus of eukaryotic cells DNA is packed with histone proteins into
   chromatin. The originating nucleo-protein complex is the regulatory
   platform for all genetic processes. Of these, posttranslational
   modifications of the histone proteins play a key role as they are
   thought to direct different chromatin states. Most histone modifications
   appear to not have a direct effect onto chromatin structure, but work
   via recruitment of specific binding proteins. A large number of such
   individual factors interacting with diverse histone marks have been
   identified and characterized. Also, global approaches have been
   established that aim to define the interactome of histone modifications
   or patterns thereof. We summarize the experimental approaches that are
   used to determine histone modification readout and discuss complexities
   that are emerging within this regulatory system.

TI Effect of dietary iodine on thyroid hormones and energy blood
   metabolites in lactating goats
SO ANIMAL
AB Aim of this work was to evaluate if long-term dietary supplementation of
   potassium iodide (KI) to dairy goats can influence metabolic and
   hormonal parameters. Thirty Sarda crossbred dairy goats were divided
   into three groups, which were orally administered 0 (control group;
   CON), 0.45 (low iodine group; LI) or 0.90 (high iodine group; HI) mg of
   KI/day, respectively. The daily dose of KI (76.5% of iodine) was
   administered as salt dissolved in water for 8 weeks. Plasma contents of
   nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), urea, glucose, insulin, free
   triiodothyronine (FT(3)) and thyroxine (FT(4)) were determined weekly.
   Iodine supplementation increased significantly the FT(3) hormone (P =
   0.007) and FT(3)/FT(4) ratio (P = 0.001) and tended to influence the
   FT(4) hormone (P = 0.059). An iodine level x week of sampling
   interaction for NEFA (P = 0.013) evidenced a temporary concentration
   increase in supplemented groups. The 'Revised Quantitative Insulin
   Sensitivity Check Index' increased with KI supplementation (P <= 0.01).
   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and insulin were lowered (P <= 0.01) by iodine
   supplementation (groups LI and HI; P <= 0.01). The glucose concentration
   evidenced an iodine level x week of sampling interaction (P = 0.025) due
   to an unexpected and temporary increase of its concentration in the CON
   group. Glucose concentration was decreased by KI supplementation only in
   LI group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the daily supplementation of low
   doses of KI can improve insulin sensitivity and decrease BUN in dairy
   goats.

TI DNA and RNA pattern of staining during oogenesis in zebrafish (Danio
   rerio): A confocal microscopy study
SO ACTA HISTOCHEMICA
AB Oogenesis involves a sequence of cellular divisions and developmental
   changes leading to the formation of oocytes, whose role in development
   is to transfer genomic information to the next generation. During this
   process, the gene expression pattern changes considerably concomitant
   with genome remodeling, while genomic information is maintained. The
   development of the gonad in zebrafish is unique in that it goes through
   an initial ovarian phase and subsequently into either ovarian or
   testicular phases. How the germ cells choose to commit to an oogenic
   fate and enter meiosis or alternatively not to enter meiosis and commit
   to a spermatogenetic fate remains a key question in development. Lack of
   suitable markers has hampered the understanding of the principles
   controlling sex differentiation in zebrafish. The current study was
   aimed at finding substantive cytochemical markers to identify specific
   oocyte stages primarily focusing on the DNA and RNA component of cells,
   using fluorescent dyes: acridine orange and propidium iodide. The
   pattern of synthesis and appearance of nucleoli was stage specific and
   may be used to identify stages of oogenesis. A distinguishing and
   possibly diagnostic feature of the staining pattern observed was the low
   level of chromatin staining compared-to other cellular structures. This
   may be related to the more diffuse state of chromatin that occurs prior
   to thickening of chromosomes from the pachytene stage onwards. Although
   the fluorescent dyes may be useful in determining the localization of
   nucleic acids in tissue sections, it was not possible to quantify the
   relative contribution of the DNA and RNA components of specific stages
   of oocyte growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Halogenated nucleotide labeling of nascent RNAs reveals dynamic
   transcription in growing pig oocytes
SO DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS
AB Background: Germ cells differentiate into oocytes in females and are
   arrested at the first meiotic prophase. However, during arrest, oocytes
   undergo a growth phase leading to a dramatic increase in size, which is
   under control of transcription events. In the current study, we examined
   the transcriptional activity of growing pig oocytes using an
   immunocytochemical approach. Our data showed that fluorouridine (FU), a
   halogenated nucleotide, can be successfully incorporated into
   synthesizing RNAs and detected using a specific monoclonal antibody.
   Results: Using this method, we identified dynamic changes in
   transcriptional activity patterns in growing pig oocytes. Oocytes
   obtained from small follicles exhibited the highest level of
   transcription, while at the final phase of growth, transcription was no
   longer detected. These transcriptional changes were concomitant with
   chromatin compaction resulting in a tightly packed ring-like chromatin
   conformation surrounding the nucleolar structure. Also, FU incorporation
   appeared sensitive to the biochemical manipulation of transcription,
   because transcriptional inhibitors induced a decrease in signal
   intensity from FU labeling and transcriptional activation caused an
   increase in FU signal intensity. Conclusions: Our data collectively
   support that a direct link exists between chromatin configuration and
   transcriptional activity in pig oocytes, and support the suitability of
   FU for studies on transcription-related events in mammalian oocytes.

TI Risk Factors of Hypoparathyroidism Following Total Thyroidectomy for

SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB The risk factors responsible for hypoparathyroidism after total
   thyroidectomy have not been completely defined. The present study
   evaluated one surgeon's personal experience of postoperative
   hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and
   predisposing risk factors of postoperative hypoparathyroidism.
   We performed a retrospective analysis of 531 consecutive total
   thyroidectomy cases for thyroid cancer operated by single surgeon at the
   Center for Thyroid Cancer, National Cancer Center, Korea, from March
   2003 to August 2006.
   Postoperative hypoparathyroidism occurred in 135 patients (25.4 %), 19
   of whom (3.6 % of total patients) experienced permanent
   hypoparathyroidism. Parathyroid autotransplantation, bilateral central
   lymph node dissection, gross extrathyroidal extension, and the presence
   of parathyroid gland in the pathologic specimen were associated with
   postoperative hypoparathyroidism in multivariate analysis (p < 0.05,
   respectively). The presence of parathyroid gland in the pathologic
   specimen and the early period of surgeon's practice were statistically
   significant risk factors for permanent hypoparathyroidism in
   multivariate analysis (p < 0.05, respectively).
   Careful surgical technique for in situ preservation of parathyroid gland
   and autotransplantation of inadvertently removed parathyroid gland are
   important, especially in case of gross extrathyroidal extension.
   Adequate surgical experience is also an important factor. And routine
   bilateral central lymph node dissection should be done thoughtfully for
   its effect on postoperative hypoparathyroidism.

   describing purification of a histone specific protease. Here, we report
   a histone H2A specific protease (H2Asp) activity in the chicken liver
   nuclear extract The H2Asp was purified to homogeneity and was found to
   be a similar to 10.5 kDa protein. It demonstrated high specificity to
   histone H2A and was an aspartic acid like protease as shown by protease
   inhibition assay. The H2Asp, in the in vitro cleavage assay generated a
   single clipped H2A product which emigrated along with histone H4 in the
   SOS-PAGE and migrated as a single band when single H2A was used as
   substrates. The expression of H2Asp was independent of age and was
   tissue specific, which was demonstrated only in the nuclear extracts of
   chicken liver and not from the same of other tissues like brain, muscles
   and erythrocytes. It was also seen that Fi2Asp activity also exists in
   other classes of vertebrates from Pisces to Mammals. This report forms

TI Promoter demethylation of cystathionine-beta-synthetase gene contributes

SO PAIN
AB Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous gas molecule synthesized by
   cystathionine-beta-synthetase (CBS), is involved in inflammation and
   nociceptive signaling. However, the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms
   of CBS-H(2)S signaling in peripheral nociceptive processing remain
   unknown. We demonstrated that peripheral inflammation induced by
   intraplantar injection of complete Freund adjuvant significantly
   up-regulated expression of CBS at both protein and mRNA levels in rat
   dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The CBS inhibitors hydroxylamine and
   aminooxyacetic acid attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in a
   dose-dependent manner and reversed hyperexcitability of DRG neurons in
   inflamed rats. Intraplantar administration of NaHS (its addition mimics
   CBS production of H(2)S) or L-cysteine in healthy rats elicited
   mechanical hyperalgesia. Application of NaHS in vitro enhanced
   excitability and tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium current of DRG
   neurons from healthy rats, which was attenuated by pretreatment of
   protein kinase A inhibitor H89. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite
   sequencing demonstrated that promoter region of cbs gene was less
   methylated in DRG samples from inflamed rats than that from controls.
   Peripheral inflammation did not alter expression of DNA
   methyltransferase 3a and 3b, the 2 major enzymes for DNA methylation,
   but led to a significant up-regulation of methyl-binding domain protein
   4 and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 45 alpha, the
   enzymes involved in active DNA demethylation. Our findings suggest that
   epigenetic regulation of CBS expression may contribute to inflammatory
   hyperalgesia. H(2)S seems to increase TTX-resistant sodium channel
   current, which may be mediated by protein kinase A pathway, thus
   identifying a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic
   pain. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

   organic and inorganic Hg accumulation and was then further studied in
   the laboratory.
   Tolerance and accumulation of Hg of this plant was also high in the
   microcosm. Basipetal transport of inorganic Hg was predominant, whereas
   acropetal transport of methyl-Hg was observed with apparently negligible
   methylation or demethylation in planta. Hg concentrations were higher in
   roots > leaves > stems and in top > middle > bottom of shoots. In
   shoots, more than 60% Hg was found intracellularly where it is believed
   to be highly available to predators. Accumulation in shoots was highly
   reduced by cold, death and by competition with Cut.
   Hg in E. nuttallii shoots seems to mainly originate from the water
   column, but methyl-Hg could also be remobilized from the sediments and
   might drive in part its entry in the food web. At the cellular level,
   uptake of Hg into the cell sap of shoots seems linked to the metabolism
   and to copper transporters. The present work highlights an important
   breakthrough in our understanding of Hg accumulation and
   biomagnifications: the remobilization of methyl-Hg from sediments to
   aquatic plants and differences in uptake mechanisms of inorganic and
   methyl-Hg in a macrophyte. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Role of Histone Acetylation in Cocaine-Induced Neural Plasticity and
   Behavior
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB How do drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, cause stable changes in neural
   plasticity that in turn drive long-term changes in behavior? What kind
   of mechanism can underlie such stable changes in neural plasticity? One
   prime candidate mechanism is epigenetic mechanisms of chromatin
   regulation. Chromatin regulation has been shown to generate short-term
   and long-term molecular memory within an individual cell. They have also
   been shown to underlie cell fate decisions (or cellular memory). Now,
   there is accumulating evidence that in the CNS, these same mechanisms
   may be pivotal for drug-induced changes in gene expression and
   ultimately long-term behavioral changes. As these mechanisms are also
   being found to be fundamental for learning and memory, an exciting new
   possibility is the extinction of drug-seeking behavior by manipulation
   of epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we critically discuss the
   evidence demonstrating a key role for chromatin regulation via histone
   acetylation in cocaine action. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews (2013)

TI Winter peaks of methylmercury in deposition to a remote Scottish
   mountain lake
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Depositional records of methylmercury (MeHg) are rare, especially for
   remote and mountainous areas. Our data from Lochnagar, a mountain lake
   in Scotland, covering a 7-year period from 2001-2008, show an unusual
   seasonal pattern in that elevated MeNg concentrations occur each winter
   while concentrations each summer fall below the limit of detection. To
   our knowledge this is the first time this seasonal pattern has been
   reported. Peak concentrations at the site in October 2006 (1.2 ng L(-1))
   are amongst the highest reported depositional values in the literature.
   As the soils and lakes in the region are frozen or snow covered for much
   of each winter, we consider possible sources of this winter deposited
   MeHg to be either aqueous phase methylation in the atmosphere or marine
   evasion. However, the factor driving this seasonal pattern is likely to
   be scavenging by snow, as elevated concentrations in deposition coincide
   with periods of snowfall at the site. If this mechanism is correct, then
   predicted impacts of climate change, which will reduce annual snowfall
   at the site by between 50% and 100% by 2080, will effectively eliminate
   this input source. However, other climate-influenced inputs of mercury,
   such as remobilisation from catchment soils, are likely to increase and
   negate any benefit. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
AB Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) is the most common cause of death in
   MEN patients.
   It is curative by prophylactic total thyroidectomy, but controversies
   remain as to the optimal timing for prophylactic thyroidectomy. The
   current recommendation is for prophylactic total thyroidectomy before
   age 5, but a recent study suggested that in the ethnic Chinese, even
   "high risk" mutations did not result in early malignant change, and it
   was suggested that prophylactic thyroidectomy may be performed at a
   later age. We report a case of an ethnic Chinese girl with MEN2A codon
   634 (C634R) mutation, whose operative specimen at prophylactic
   thyroidectomy at 4 years 8 months showed MTC. We advocate that

TI Stoichiometry of chromatin-associated protein complexes revealed by
   label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Many cellular proteins assemble into macromolecular protein complexes.
   The identification of protein-protein interactions and quantification of
   their stoichiometry is therefore crucial to understand the molecular
   function of protein complexes. Determining the stoichiometry of protein
   complexes is usually achieved by mass spectrometry-based methods that
   rely on introducing stable isotope-labeled reference peptides into the
   sample of interest. However, these approaches are laborious and not
   suitable for high-throughput screenings. Here, we describe a robust and
   easy to implement label-free relative quantification approach that
   combines the detection of high-confidence protein-protein interactions
   with an accurate determination of the stoichiometry of the identified
   protein-protein interactions in a single experiment. We applied this
   method to two chromatin-associated protein complexes for which the
   stoichiometry thus far remained elusive: the MBD3/NuRD and PRC2 complex.
   For each of these complexes, we accurately determined the stoichiometry
   of the core subunits while at the same time identifying novel
   interactors and their stoichiometry.

TI Polymorphic variants of DNMT3A and the risk of endometriosis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB Objective: Overexpression of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and
   aberrant methylation of various genes in eutopic endometrium have been
   demonstrated in women with endometriosis. We aimed to study whether
   DNMT3A polymorphisms could be a genetic risk factor for endometriosis
   and endometriosis-related infertility.
   Study design: We studied 5 SNPs (rs2289195, rs7590760, rs13401241,
   rs749131 and rs1550117) located in the DNMT3A gene in 357 women with
   endometriosis and 640 controls.
   Results: We did not observe significant differences between genotype and
   allele frequencies of rs2289195, rs7590760, rs13401241, rs749131 and
   rs1550117 SNPs in women with endometriosis, endometriosis-related
   infertility, and controls. The lowest p values of the trend test were
   observed for DNMT3A rs1550117 in endometriosis and endometriosis-related
   infertility (p(trend) = 0.049 and p(trend) = 0.055, respectively).
   Conclusions: Our results did not supply evidence for the contribution of
   SNPs located in DNMT3A to either endometriosis or endometriosis-related
   infertility. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI PAX8 Mouse Monoclonal Antibody [BC12] Recognizes a Restricted Epitope
   and Is Highly Sensitive in Renal Cell and Ovarian Cancers But Does Not
   Cross-react With B Cells and Tumors of Pancreatic Origin
SO APPLIED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
AB PAX8 is expressed in a high percentage of renal cell and ovarian
   cancers; however, the current existing anti-PAX8 rabbit polyclonal (P)
   antibodies also recognize B cells, pancreatic cancers, carcinoids, and
   some soft tissue tumors. Cross-reactivity with B cells can be especially
   troublesome in lymph nodes when identifying tumors of unknown origin. A
   new mouse monoclonal (M) anti-PAX8 antibody (Clone BC 12) has been
   developed that recognizes PAX8 expression in a high percentage of renal
   cell and ovarian carcinomas, whereas exhibiting no staining of B cells.
   PAX8 (M) was tested for specificity and sensitivity in over 1300 cases
   of both normal and neoplastic tissues. PAX8 (M) demonstrated superior
   staining sensitivity in clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinomas
   (88.8% vs. 84.4%) and in serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas (87%
   vs. 83%), when compared with PAX8 (P). PAX8 (M) also stained a high
   percentage of endometrial and thyroid cancers, 67.5% and 60.7%,
   respectively. PAX8 (M) demonstrated low sensitivity in cervical and
   bladder cancers, 2.5% and 1.4%, respectively. All other cancers
   including lung, breast, prostate, stomach, liver, soft tissue, pancreas,
   testis, brain, colon, melanoma, lymphoma, adrenal, pituitary, and rectal
   were negative. In normal tissue, PAX8 (P) stained lymph nodes, pancreas,
   and neuroendocrine cells of stomach and colon. In contrast, PAX8 (M) was
   negative in each of these tissues. These results demonstrate that mouse
   monoclonal PAX8 [BC12] stains nuclei exclusively and performs well in
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. PAX8 (M) is a highly sensitive
   marker for thyroid, renal, and ovarian cancers. Importantly, PAX8 (M)
   does not stain B cells and does not seem to recognize epitopes of
   pancreatic origin and neuroendocrine cells in stomach and colon; thus,
   providing superior specificity and making PAX8 [BC 12] an excellent
   marker for confirming primary tumor site and for differential diagnosis.

TI Conserved SAMS function in regulating egg-laying in C. elegans
SO JOURNAL OF RECEPTORS AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION
AB S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is an intermediate metabolite of
   methionine and serves as the methyl donor for many biological
   methylation reactions. The synthesis of SAM is catalyzed by SAM
   synthetase (SAMS), which transfers the adenosyl moiety of
   adenosine-5'-triphosphate to methionine. In the nematode Caenorhabditis
   elegans, four sams family genes, sams-1, -3, -4 and -5, are predicted to
   encode SAMS proteins. However, their physiological roles remain unclear.
   Here we show that the four predicted SAMS proteins in fact have the
   ability to catalyze the formation of SAM in vitro, and revealed that
   only sams-1 mutant animals among the family genes exhibited a
   significant reduction in egg-laying. Using transgenic animals carrying a
   transcriptional reporter for each sams gene promoter, we observed that
   each sams promoter confers a distinct expression pattern with respect to
   tissue, time of expression and expression level (i.e. promoter
   specificity). Promoter-swap experiments revealed that the ectopic
   expression of SAMS-3, -4 or -5 driven by the sams-1 promoter completely
   rescued egg-laying in sams-1 mutants. These data indicate that SAMS
   protein function is conserved throughout the entire family.

TI An Oct4-Sall4-Nanog network controls developmental progression in the
   pre-implantation mouse embryo
SO MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
AB Landmark events occur in a coordinated manner during pre-implantation
   development of the mammalian embryo, yet the regulatory network that
   orchestrates these events remains largely unknown. Here, we present the
   first systematic investigation of the network in pre-implantation mouse
   embryos using morpholino-mediated gene knockdowns of key embryonic stem
   cell (ESC) factors followed by detailed transcriptome analysis of pooled
   embryos, single embryos, and individual blastomeres. We delineated the
   regulons of Oct4, Sall4, and Nanog and identified a set of
   metabolism-and transport-related genes that were controlled by these
   transcription factors in embryos but not in ESCs. Strikingly, the
   knockdown embryos arrested at a range of developmental stages. We
   provided evidence that the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b has a role in
   determining the extent to which a knockdown embryo can develop. We
   further showed that the feed-forward loop comprising Dnmt3b, the
   pluripotency factors, and the miR-290-295 cluster exemplifies a network
   motif that buffers embryos against gene expression noise. Our findings
   indicate that Oct4, Sall4, and Nanog form a robust and integrated
   network to govern mammalian pre-implantation development. Molecular

TI Ectopic Thymoma Can Mimic Benign and Malignant Thyroid Lesions on Fine
   Needle Aspiration Cytology: A Case Report and Literature Review
SO ACTA CYTOLOGICA
AB Background: Ectopic cervical thymomas are rare and there are few
   descriptions of the cytologic findings based on fine needle aspiration.
   Their appearances can be misinterpreted as either benign or malignant
   lesions of the thyroid. The authors report such a case occurring in a
   patient with Sotos syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by somatic
   overgrowth and cognitive impairment. Case Report:The patient developed a
   neck mass that was examined first by fine needle aspiration and then by
   pathologic examination of the resected specimen. On fine needle
   aspiration, a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid was
   favoured, based on the presence of large cohesive sheets of anastomosing
   papillary tissue fragments with fibrovascular cores. Pathologic
   examination of the resection specimen showed a thymoma, subtype B3. The
   cytologic findings correlated with the presence of nuclear palisading of
   tumour cells around perivascular spaces. Conclusion: To the best of our
   knowledge, this histologic subtype of thymoma has never been reported in
   ectopic cervical thymic tissue, nor these particular cytologic findings
   that can lead to an erroneous diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Moreover,
   this is the first description of thymoma in association with Sotos
   syndrome. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI GATA3 acts upstream of FOXA1 in mediating ESR1 binding by shaping
   enhancer accessibility
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Estrogen receptor (ESR1) drives growth in the majority of human breast
   cancers by binding to regulatory elements and inducing transcription
   events that promote tumor growth. Differences in enhancer occupancy by
   ESR1 contribute to the diverse expression profiles and clinical outcome
   observed in breast cancer patients. GATA3 is an ESR1-cooperating
   transcription factor mutated in breast tumors; however, its genomic
   properties are not fully defined. In order to investigate the
   composition of enhancers involved in estrogen-induced transcription and
   the potential role of GATA3, we performed extensive ChIP-sequencing in
   unstimulated breast cancer cells and following estrogen treatment. We
   find that GATA3 is pivotal in mediating enhancer accessibility at
   regulatory regions involved in ESR1-mediated transcription. GATA3
   silencing resulted in a global redistribution of cofactors and active
   histone marks prior to estrogen stimulation. These global genomic
   changes altered the ESR1-binding profile that subsequently occurred
   following estrogen, with events exhibiting both loss and gain in binding
   affinity, implying a GATA3-mediated redistribution of ESR1 binding. The
   GATA3-mediated redistributed ESR1 profile correlated with changes in
   gene expression, suggestive of its functionality. Chromatin loops at the
   TFF locus involving ESR1-bound enhancers occurred independently of ESR1
   when GATA3 was silenced, indicating that GATA3, when present on the
   chromatin, may serve as a licensing factor for estrogen-ESR1-mediated
   interactions between cis-regulatory elements. Together, these
   experiments suggest that GATA3 directly impacts ESR1 enhancer
   accessibility, and may potentially explain the contribution of
   mutant-GATA3 in the heterogeneity of ESR1+ breast cancer.

TI Differential Effects of High-Temperature Stress on Nuclear Topology and
   Transcription of Repetitive Noncoding and Coding Rye Sequences
SO CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH
AB The plant stress response has been extensively characterized at the
   biochemical and physiological levels. However, knowledge concerning
   repetitive sequence genome fraction modulation during extreme
   temperature conditions is scarce. We studied high-temperature effects on
   subtelomeric repetitive sequences (pSc200) and 45S rDNA in rye seedlings
   submitted to 40 degrees C during 4 h. Chromatin organization patterns
   were evaluated through fluorescent in situ hybridization and
   transcription levels were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR.
   Additionally, the nucleolar dynamics were evaluated through fibrillarin
   immunodetection in interphase nuclei. The results obtained clearly
   demonstrated that the pSc200 sequence organization is not affected by
   high-temperature stress (HTS) and proved for the first time that this
   noncoding subtelomeric sequence is stably transcribed. Conversely, it
   was demonstrated that HTS treatment induces marked rDNA chromatin
   decondensation along with nucleolar enlargement and a significant
   increase in ribosomal gene transcription. The role of noncoding and
   coding repetitive rye sequences in the plant stress response that are
   suggested by their clearly distinct behaviors is discussed. While the
   heterochromatic conformation of pSc200 sequences seems to be involved in
   the stabilization of the interphase chromatin architecture under stress
   conditions, the dynamic modulation of nucleolar and rDNA topology and
   transcription suggest their role in plant stress response pathways.

TI Highly Synergistic Effect of Sequential Treatment with Epigenetic and
   Anticancer Drugs To Overcome Drug Resistance in Breast Cancer Cells Is
   Mediated via Activation of p21 Gene Expression Leading to G2/M Cycle
   Arrest
SO MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS
AB Epigenetic alterations such as aberrant DNA methylation and histone
   modifications contribute substantially to both the cause and maintenance
   of drug resistance. These epigenetic changes lead to silencing of tumor
   suppressor genes involved in key DNA damage-response pathways, making
   drug-resistant cancer cells nonresponsive to conventional anticancer
   drug therapies. Our hypothesis is that treating drug-resistant cells
   with epigenetic drugs could restore the sensitivity to anticancer drugs
   by reactivating previously silenced genes. To test our hypothesis, we
   used drug-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR) and two epigenetic
   drugs that act via different mechanisms-5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
   (decitabine, DAC), a demethylating agent, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic
   acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor-in combination with
   doxorubicin. We show that the sequential treatment of resistant cells,
   first with an epigenetic drug (DAC), and then with doxorubicin, induces
   a highly synergistic effect, thus reducing the IC(50) of doxorubicin by
   several thousand fold. The sequential treatment caused over 90%
   resistant cells to undergo G2/M cell cycle arrest, determined to be due
   to upregulation of p21(WAFI/CIPI) expression, which is responsible for
   cell-cycle regulation. The induction of p21(WAFI/CIPI) correlated well
   with the depletion of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), an enzyme that
   promotes methylation of DNA, suggesting that the p21(WAFI/CIPI) gene may
   have been methylated and hence is inactive in MCF-7/ADR cells.
   Microarray analysis shows expression of several tumor suppressor genes
   and downregulation of tumor promoter genes, particularly in sequentially
   treated resistant cells. Sequential treatment was found to be
   significantly more effective than simultaneous treatment, and DAC was
   more effective than SAHA in overcoming doxorubicin resistance.
   Synergistic effect with sequential treatment was also seen in
   drug-sensitive breast cancer cells, but the effect was significantly
   more pronounced in resistant cells. In conclusion, the sequential
   treatment of an epigenetic drug in combination with doxorubicin induces
   a highly synergistic effect that overcomes doxorubicin resistance in
   breast cancer cells.

SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB A high level of circulating DNA (cirDNA) in cancer patients has been
   correlated with poor outcomes. Studies have demonstrated the critical
   contributions of the tumor-derived cirDNA. In this report, we
   investigated the roles of the non-tumor-derived cirDNA (nt-cirDNA) in
   determining the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Plasma samples from 58 advanced NSCLC patients and 52 controls were

   the unmethylation status of an epithelial-specific marker, the SHP-1
   promoter 2 (unmethylated SHP1P2). Clinicopathological correlations were
   analyzed.
   There was a significant increase in the total amount of cirDNA in NSCLC
   patients compared with controls: 4.3 ng ml(-1) [0.82-49.8] and 2.0 ng
   ml(-1) [0.03-26.9], respectively (p < 0.01). An increased amount of the
   unmethylated SHP1P2 in advanced NSCLC was also detected: 3.4 ng ml(-1)
   [1.2-24.8] versus 2.0 ng ml(-1) [0.03-26.9] in the controls (p = 0.026).
   Survival analyses revealed that high levels of total cirDNA and
   unmethylated SHP1P2 were significantly associated with decreased
   survival. However, the total cirDNA had a better prognostic correlation
   than the unmethylated SHP1P2. Multivariate analysis identified total
   cirDNA (p = 0.004) and systemic treatment (p = 0.002) as independent
   prognostic parameters.
   The level of total cirDNA in NSCLC is an important prognostic parameter
   that demonstrates the contributions from both tumor-derived sources and
   non-tumor-derived sources.

TI NGAL Controls the Metastatic Potential of Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma
   Cells
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: We have previously identified neutrophil gelatinase-associated
   lipocalin (NGAL) as one of the genes mediating the oncogenic activity of
   nuclear factor-kappa B in human anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs).
   Objectives: To further investigate the role of NGAL in thyroid cancer,
   we established NGAL knocked-down and NGAL overexpressing ATC cell lines.
   Results: We found that the ability of NGAL knocked-down cells to degrade
   Matrigel in a transwell invasion assay and to form lung metastasis in
   nude mice was decreased. BecauseNGALbinds matrix metalloproteinase-9
   (MMP-9), to form a macromolecular complex involved in the regulation of
   metastatic spread of cancer cells and given the strong expression of
   both genes in tissue specimens from human ATCs, we analyzed the MMP-9
   enzymatic activity in NGAL-null ATC cells. Enzymatic immunoassays show
   that MMP-9 activity is reduced in NGAL-null ATC cells, even if its
   expression is not affected by NGAL inhibition. Ectopic expression of
   NGAL in an ATC cell line not expressing NGAL determines an increase of
   its metastatic property. The use of a mutated form of NGAL, unable to
   bind MMP-9, has no positive effect on the invasive potential of ATC
   cells and does not improve the MMP-9 enzymatic activity.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate NGAL as a novel target of nuclear
   factor-kappa B prometastatic activity in thyroid cancer through
   enhancement of MMP-9 enzymatic activity. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98:

TI Black Raspberry-Derived Anthocyanins Demethylate Tumor Suppressor Genes
   Through the Inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in Colon Cancer Cells
SO NUTRITION AND CANCER-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB We previously reported that oral administration of black raspberry
   powder decreased promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes in
   tumors from patients with colorectal cancer. The anthocyanins (ACs) in
   black raspberries are responsible, at least in part, for their
   cancer-inhibitory effects. In the present study, we asked if ACs are
   responsible for the demethylation effects observed in colorectal
   cancers. Three days of treatment of ACs at 0.5, 5, and 25g/ml suppressed
   activity and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116, Caco2 and
   SW480 cells. Promoters of CDKN2A, and SFRP2, SFRP5, and WIF1, upstream
   of Wnt pathway, were demethylated by ACs. mRNA expression of some of
   these genes was increased. mRNA expression of -catenin and c-Myc,
   downstream of Wnt pathway, and cell proliferation were decreased;
   apoptosis was increased. ACs were taken up into HCT116 cells and were
   differentially localized with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the same cells
   visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Although it was
   reported that DNMT3B is regulated by c-Myc in mouse lymphoma, DNMT3B did
   not bind with c-Myc in HCT116 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest
   that ACs are responsible, at least in part, for the demethylation
   effects of whole black raspberries in colorectal cancers.

TI The inhibitory effect of ABA on floral transition is mediated by ABI5 in
   Arabidopsis
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Seed germination and flowering initiation are both transitions
   responding to similar seasonal cues. This study shows that ABSCISIC
   ACID-INSENSITIVE MUTANT 5 (ABI5), a bZIP transcription factor, which
   plays an important role in the abscisic acid (ABA)-arrested seed
   germination, is robustly associated with the floral transition in
   Arabidopsis. Under long-day conditions, overexpression of ABI5 could
   delay floral transition through upregulating FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)
   expression. In contrast, ectopically overexpressing FLC in an abi5
   mutant reversed the earlier flowering phenotype. Further analysis
   indicated that transactivation of FLC could be promoted by ABI5 and/or
   other abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs).
   The expression of FLC that was promoted by ABI5 and/or other ABFs could
   be blocked in a triple SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK) mutant,
   snrk2.2/2.3/2.6, despite the presence of ABA. In sharp contrast, when
   SnRK2.6 was coexpressed, the reduction of transactivity of FLC was
   reverted in mesophyll protoplasts of snrk2.2/2.3/2.6. Additional results
   from analysing transgenic plants carrying mutations of phosphoamino
   acids (ABI5(S42AS145AT201A)), which are conserved in ABI5, suggested
   that SnRK2-mediated ABI5 and/or ABF phosphorylation may be crucial for
   promoting FLC expression. The transgenic plants ABI5(S42AS145AT201A)
   were insensitive to ABA in seed germination, in addition to having an
   earlier flowering phenotype. Direct binding of ABI5 to the ABRE/G-box
   promoter elements existing in FLC was demonstrated by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation. Mutations at the ABRE/G-box regions in FLC promoter
   sequences abolished the ABI5-promoted transactivation of FLC. In
   summary, these results may decipher the inhibitory effect of ABA on
   floral transition in Arabidopsis.

TI Increased inflammatory response in aged mice is associated with
   age-related zinc deficiency and zinc transporter dysregulation
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Aging is a complex process associated with physiological changes in
   numerous organ systems. In particular, aging of the immune system is
   characterized by progressive dysregulation of immune responses,
   resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, impaired
   vaccination efficacy and systemic low-grade chronic inflammation.
   Increasing evidence suggest that intracellular zinc homeostasis,
   regulated by zinc transporter expression, is critically involved in the
   signaling and activation of immune cells. We hypothesize that epigenetic
   alterations and nutritional deficits associated with aging may lead to
   zinc transporter dysregulation, resulting in decreases in cellular zinc
   levels and enhanced inflammation with age. The goal of this study was to
   examine the contribution of age-related zinc deficiency and zinc
   transporter dysregulation on the inflammatory response in immune cells.
   The effects of zinc deficiency and age on the induction of inflammatory
   responses were determined using an in vitro cell culture system and an
   aged mouse model. We showed that zinc deficiency, particularly the
   reduction in intracellular zinc in immune cells, was associated with
   increased inflammation with age. Furthermore, reduced Zip 6 expression
   enhanced proinflammatory response, and age-specific Zip 6 dysregulation
   correlated with an increase in Zip 6 promoter methylation. Furthermore,
   restoring zinc status via dietary supplementation reduced
   aged-associated inflammation. Our data suggested that age-related
   epigenetic dysregulation in zinc transporter expression may influence
   cellular zinc levels and contribute to increased susceptibility to
   inflammation with age. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI The DNA Methylation Inhibitor 5-Azacytidine Increases Regulatory T Cells
   and Alleviates Airway Inflammation in Ovalbumin-Sensitized Mice
SO INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: Asthma is characterized as a chronic inflammatory disorder
   of the airways associated with an enhanced TH2 response to inhaled
   allergens. CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells are controlled by the master
   transcription factor FoxP3 and strictly maintain peripheral
   immunotolerance. Epigenetic regulation of FoxP3 by DNA methyltransferase
   inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine (Aza), can generate a steady supply of
   functional Treg cells. Therefore, we propose that Aza can augment Treg
   cells in vivo to prevent the pathogenesis of asthma. Methods: BALB/c
   mice were sensitized with chicken ovalbumin (OVA) and treated with
   different doses of Aza. Airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine,
   eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, circulating titers of
   OVA-specific IgG1 and IgE, and stimulating levels of TH2 cytokines from
   splenocytes were then determined. Cellular populations were examined by
   flow cytometry. PC61 antibody, which depletes CD25+ cells, was used to
   verify the role of CD25+ cells in Aza-induced tolerance. Results:
   Administration of Aza to OVA-sensitized mice diminished airway
   hyper-reactivity, pulmonary eosinophilia, levels of OVA-specific IgG1
   and IgE in serum, and secretion of TH2 cytokines from OVA-stimulated
   splenocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Percentages of CD25+ and FoxP3+
   cells in the CD4+ cell population were notably increased in Aza-treated
   mice compared to sensitized control mice. Furthermore, the major
   symptoms of asthma were exacerbated by depleting CD25+ cells in
   Aza-treated mice. Conclusions: Aza may have applications as a novel
   clinical strategy to increase the production of Treg cells in order to
   modulate the airway inflammation associated with asthma. Copyright (C)

TI Deciphering the transcriptional regulation of microRNA genes in humans
   with ACTLocater
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Understanding the transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is
   extremely important for determining the specific roles they play in
   signaling cascades. However, precise identification of transcription
   factor binding sites (TFBSs) orchestrating the expressions of miRNAs
   remains a challenge. By combining accessible chromatin sequences of 12
   cell types released by the ENCODE Project, we found that a significant
   fraction (similar to 80%) of such integrated sequences, evolutionary
   conserved and in regions upstream of human miRNA genes that are
   independently transcribed, were preserved across cell types.
   Accordingly, we developed a computational method, Accessible and
   Conserved TFBSs Locater (ACTLocater), incorporating this chromatin
   feature and evolutionary conservation to identify the TFBSs associated
   with human miRNA genes. ACTLocater achieved high positive predictive
   values, as revealed by the experimental validation of FOXA1 predictions
   and by the comparison of its predictions of some other transcription
   factors (TFs) to empirical ChIP-seq data. Most notably, ACTLocater was
   widely applicable as indicated by the successful prediction of TF ->
   miRNA interactions in cell types whose chromatin accessibility profiles
   were not incorporated. By applying ACTLocater to TFs with characterized
   binding specificities, we compiled a novel repository of putative TF ->
   miRNA interactions and displayed it in ACTViewer, providing a promising
   foundation for future investigations to elucidate the regulatory
   mechanisms of miRNA transcription in humans.

TI Synergistic Silencing by Promoter Methylation and Reduced AP-2 alpha
   Transactivation of the Proapoptotic HRK Gene Confers Apoptosis
   Resistance and Enhanced Tumor Growth
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB The Harakiri (HRK) gene encodes an important proapoptotic mitochondrial
   protein of the Bcl-2 family. HRK is expressed in normal tissues but is
   decreased in many cancers such as melanoma, the mechanisms of which have
   not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that HRK is silenced by
   hypermethylation of a major proximal CpG island in the HRK promoter.
   Furthermore, we show that HRK is a novel target gene regulated by the
   transcription factor AP-2 alpha, which interacts with an AP-2 alpha
   binding site in the HRK promoter. Hypermethylation of the major proximal
   CpG island (which contains the AP-2 alpha binding site within the most
   densely methylated -218- to -194-bp region) inhibited AP-2 alpha binding
   and transcriptional activity. Artificial overexpression of AP-2 alpha in
   melanoma cells up-regulated HRK transcription, which was further
   restored by treatment with DNA methyttransferase inhibitor
   5-azacytidine. Artificial overexpression of HRK by recombinant
   adenovirus induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, inhibited melanoma cell
   growth in vitro, and markedly reduced in vivo melanoma growth in a nude
   mouse xenograft model. RNA interference by siHRK or siAP-2 alpha
   reversed the above effects. We conclude that the synergistic effects of
   HRK promoter hypermethylation and loss of AP-2 alpha transactivation
   lead to HRK gene silencing and confer resistance to apoptosis and
   enhanced tumor growth. These novel molecular lesions may provide the
   basis for new therapeutic approaches to treating AP-2 alpha- and
   HRK-deficient cancers. (Am J Pathol 2013, 182: 84-95;

TI Effects of the herbicide imazapyr on juvenile Oregon spotted frogs
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Conflict between native amphibians and aquatic weed management in the
   Pacific Northwest is rarely recognized because most native
   stillwater-breeding amphibian species move upland during summer, when
   herbicide application to control weeds in aquatic habitats typically
   occurs. However, aquatic weed management may pose a risk for aquatic
   species present in wetlands through the summer, such as the Oregon
   spotted frog (OSF, Rana pretiosa), a state endangered species in
   Washington. Acute toxicity of herbicides used to control aquatic weeds
   tends to be low, but the direct effects of herbicide tank mixes on OSFs
   have remained unexamined. We exposed juvenile OSFs to tank mixes of the
   herbicide imazapyr, a surfactant, and a marker dye in a 96-h
   static-renewal test. The tank mix was chosen because of its low toxicity
   to fish and its effectiveness in aquatic weed control. Concentrations
   were those associated with low-volume (3.5?L/ha) and high-volume
   (7.0?L/ha) applications of imazapyr and a clean-water control. Following
   exposure, frogs were reared for two months in clean water to identify
   potential latent effects on growth. Endpoints evaluated included feeding
   behavior, growth, and body and liver condition indices. We recorded no
   mortalities and found no significant differences for any end point
   between the herbicide-exposed and clean-water control frogs. The results
   suggest that imazapyr use in wetland restoration poses a low risk of
   direct toxic effects on juvenile OSFs. Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

   Protein arginine methylation is an abundant modification that has been
   implicated in signal transduction, gene transcription, DNA repair and

TI Brief Report: The Potential Role of Epigenetics on Multipotent Cell
   Differentiation Capacity of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
SO STEM CELLS
AB Human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs) are a readily
   available source of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for cell therapy.
   We were interested in understanding how differences from human bone
   marrow (BM)derived MSCs might yield insights into MSC biology. We found
   that HUCPVCs exhibited increased telomerase activity and longer
   telomeres compared with BM-MSCs. We also observed enhanced expression of
   the pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in HUCPVCs. The
   methylation of OCT4 and NANOG promoters was similar in both cell types,
   indicating that differences in the expression of pluripotency factors
   between the MSCs were not associated with epigenetic changes. MSC
   methylation at these loci is greater than reported for embryonic stem
   cells but less than in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that
   multipotentiality of MSCs is epigenetically restricted. These results
   are consistent with the notion that the MSC population (whether BM- or

TI Transporter Gene Expression in Human Head and Neck Squamous Cell
   Carcinoma and Associated Epigenetic Regulatory Mechanisms
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Expression levels of membrane transporters may affect the disposition,
   and thereby treatment efficacy, of anticancer drugs in human head and
   neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Herein, we analyzed the gene
   expression profile of membrane transporters in HNSCC. In addition, we
   evaluated the mechanisms of transporter regulation in HNSCC and focused
   on the role of the nuclear pregnane X receptor (or NR1I2) and epigenetic
   mechanisms. Real-time RT-PCR revealed a significantly increased mRNA
   expression of membrane transporters SLCO1A2 and SLCO1B3 and a
   significantly decreased expression of transporters SLCO281, SLCO2A1, and
   ABCC3 in human HNSCC tumors compared with adjacent normal mucosa. An
   association between SLCO281 mRNA Levels in tumors and 5-year survival of
   patients with HNSCC was observed (chi(2) = 6.59, P = 0.010). Bisulfite
   sequencing revealed that promoter CpG islands of ABCC3 and SLCO2A1 were
   not hypermethylated, indicating that these genes were not epigenetically
   silenced in HNSCC tumors. In HNSCC-derived cell lines, transcript
   expression of transporters (eg, ABCC3 or SLCO2A1; P < 0.001 for both)
   and NR1I2 (P < 0.001) was markedly induced by the DNA methyltransferase
   inhibitor, decitabine. Cotreatment with the prototypical pregnane X
   receptor activator, rifampicin, significantly reversed
   decitabine-induced ABCC3 and SLCO2A1 expression. In summary, the
   expression of drug transporters i) is markedly changed in HNSCC tumor
   tissues compared with normal mucosa, ii) might be predictive of the
   outcome of patients with HNSCC, and iii) is affected by novel epigenetic
   therapies and is further modulated by nuclear receptor mediated
   mechanisms. (Am J Pathol 2013, 182: 234-243;

TI Epigenetic Regulation of Galectin-3 Expression by beta 1 Integrins
   Promotes Cell Adhesion and Migration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Introduction of the integrin beta 1- but not the beta 3-subunit in GE11
   cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-like
   phenomenon that is characterized by the loss of cell-cell contacts, cell
   scattering, increased cell migration and RhoA activity, and fibronectin
   fibrillogenesis. Because galactosebinding lectins (galectins) have been
   implicated in these phenomena, we investigated whether galectins are
   involved in the beta-induced phenotype. We examined 9 galectins and,
   intriguingly, found that the expression of galectin-3 (Gal-3) is
   specifically induced by beta 1 but not by beta 3. Using beta 1-beta 3
   chimeric integrins, we show that the induction of Gal-3 expression
   requires the hypervariable region in the extracellular domain of beta 1,
   but not its cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, Gal-3 expression does not
   depend on RhoA signaling, serum factors, or any of the major signal
   transduction pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC), p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase-1/-2 (ERK-1/2), phosphatidylinositol3- OH kinase
   (PI3-K), or Src kinases. Instead, Gal-3 expression is controlled in an
   epigenetic manner. Whereas DNA methylation of the Lgals3 promoter
   maintains Gal-3 silencing in GE11 cells, expression of beta 1 causes its
   demethylation, leading to transcriptional activation of the Lgals3 gene.
   In turn, Gal-3 expression enhances beta 1 integrin-mediated cell
   adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN), as well as cell
   migration. Gal-3 also promotes beta 1-mediated cell adhesion to LN and
   Collagen-1 (Col)-1 in cells that endogenously express Gal-3 and beta 1
   integrins. In conclusion, we identify a functional feedback-loop between
   beta 1 integrins and Gal-3 that involves the epigenetic induction of
   Gal-3 expression during integrin-induced EMT and cell scattering.

TI Canonical Transient Receptor Potential Channel 2 (TRPC2) as a Major
   Regulator of Calcium Homeostasis in Rat Thyroid FRTL-5 Cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Mammalian non-selective transient receptor potential cation channels
   (TRPCs) are important in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis.
   In thyroid cells, including rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells, calcium regulates
   a multitude of processes. RT-PCR screening of FRTL-5 cells revealed the
   presence of TRPC2 channels only. Knockdown of TRPC2 using shRNA
   (shTRPC2) resulted in decreased ATP-evoked calcium peak amplitude and
   inward current. In calcium-free buffer, there was no difference in the
   ATP-evoked calcium peak amplitude between control cells and shTRPC2
   cells. Store-operated calcium entry was indistinguishable between the
   two cell lines. Basal calcium entry was enhanced in shTRPC2 cells,
   whereas the level of PKC beta 1 andPKC delta, the activity of
   sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and the calcium content in
   the endoplasmic reticulum were decreased. Stromal interaction molecule
   (STIM) 2, but not STIM1, was arranged in puncta in resting shTRPC2 cells
   but not in control cells. Phosphorylation site Orai1 S27A/S30A mutant
   and non-functional Orai1 R91W attenuated basal calcium entry in shTRPC2
   cells. Knockdown of PKC delta with siRNA increased STIM2 punctum
   formation and enhanced basal calcium entry but decreased
   sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in wild-type cells.
   Transfection of a truncated, non-conducting mutant of TRPC2 evoked
   similar results. Thus, TRPC2 functions as a major regulator of calcium
   homeostasis in rat thyroid cells.

TI Characterization and Structure of the Aquifex aeolicus Protein DUF752 A
   BACTERIAL tRNA-METHYLTRANSFERASE (MnmC2) FUNCTIONING WITHOUT THE USUALLY
   FUSED OXIDASE DOMAIN (MnmC1)
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Post-transcriptional modifications of the wobble uridine (U34) of tRNAs
   play a critical role in reading NNA/G codons belonging to split codon
   boxes. In a subset of Escherichia coli tRNA, this wobble uridine is
   modified to 5-methylaminomethyluridine (mnm(5)U34) through sequential
   enzymatic reactions. Uridine 34 is first converted to
   5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine (cmnm(5)U34) by the MnmE-Mnm Genzyme
   complex. The cmnm(5)U34 is further modified to mnm(5)U by the
   bifunctional MnmC protein. In the first reaction, the FAD-dependent
   oxidase domain (MnmC1) converts cmnm(5)U into 5-aminomethyluridine
   (nm(5)U34), and this reaction is immediately followed by the methylation
   of the free amino group into mnm(5)U34 by the
   S-adenosylmethionine-dependent domain (MnmC2). Aquifex aeolicus lacks a
   bifunctional MnmC protein fusion and instead encodes the Rossmann-fold
   protein DUF752, which is homologous to the methyltransferase MnmC2
   domain of Escherichia coli MnmC (26% identity). Here, we determined the
   crystal structure of the A. aeolicus DUF752 protein at 2.5 angstrom
   resolution, which revealed that it catalyzes the
   S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of nm(5)U in vitro, to form
   mnm(5)U34 in tRNA. We also showed that naturally occurring tRNA from A.
   aeolicus contains the 5-mnm group attached to the C5 atom of U34. Taken
   together, these results support the recent proposal of an alternative
   MnmC1-independent shortcut pathway for producing mnm(5)U34 in tRNAs.

TI Evaluation of plant species used traditionally to treat myiasis for
   activity on the survival and development of Lucilia cuprina and
   Chrysomya marginalis (Diptera: Calliphoridae)
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB Myiasis is a common parasitic problem of livestock responsible for
   severe economic losses in developing and developed countries. There are
   a number of challenges with the current control strategy, which depends
   largely on the use of pharmaceutical chemicals. These include
   inaccessibility, the increasing concern about pesticide accumulation in
   the environment and potential development of insecticide resistance in
   the devastating myiasis-causing flies. Consequently the search for
   alternatives is important. The use of plants in the treatment of wound
   myiasis in livestock as an alternative to commercial insecticides has
   been reported in resource poor areas worldwide. We therefore, undertook
   a study to establish the biological activity of seven plant species used
   against blowflies in southern Africa. A larvicidal assay was carried out
   in which third instar larvae of blowfly were fed meat treated with
   acetone leaf extracts of selected plant species. Four of the species,
   Aloe zebrina, Clausena anisata, Erythrina lysistemon and Spirostachys
   africana, induced developmental anomalies in the blowfly such as
   paralysis, prolongation of the prepuparium stage, reduced pupation
   rates, pupal malformations and reduced adult emergence. These results
   suggest that the plants may contain compounds that interfere with the
   neuroendocrine control mechanisms in the blowfly. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Prognostic significance of thyroid or cricoid cartilage invasion in
   laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer treated with organ preserving
   strategies
SO RADIATION ONCOLOGY
AB Background: The utility of definitive radiotherapy (RT) for
   locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx or
   hypopharynx in the setting of thyroid or cricoid cartilage invasion
   (TCCI) is controversial. A retrospective review of our experience was
   performed.
   Methods: Our institutional database of patients with SCC of the head and
   neck treated with radiotherapy (90% received concurrent systemic
   therapy) between 1995 and 2009 was queried. We identified 87 patients
   with T3-4 laryngeal or T4 hypopharyngeal cancer for whom initial head
   and neck imaging was available for review. Imaging of all patients was
   reviewed by a single radiologist specializing in neuroradiology. The
   presence and extent of TCCI was determined and used for stratification.
   Results: Median follow-up was 34 months. TCCI was found in 25 (29%)
   patients, eight limited to the inner cortex and another 17 involving
   both cortices. Local control (LC) was not significantly affected by TCCI
   limited to the inner cortex. However, TCCI involving both cortices was
   correlated with diminished LC at 2 years compared to the group of
   patients with no or minor invasion (55% vs. 81%, p=0.045). However, TCCI
   involving both cortices was not associated with significantly reduced
   rates of survival with a functional larynx, or overall survival (OS).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the rate of LC of T3-4 laryngeal
   or T4 hypopharyngeal SCC treated with definitive RT is not affected by
   TCCI of the inner cortex. Although decreased LC was significantly
   associated with TCCI involving both cortices, this factor did not appear
   to result in reduced rates of survival with a functional larynx or OS.
   Therefore, organ preservation may remain an option in these patients.

TI HERV-H RNA is abundant in human embryonic stem cells and a precise
   marker for pluripotency
SO RETROVIROLOGY
AB Background: Certain post-translational modifications to histones,
   including H3K4me3, as well as binding sites for the transcription factor
   STAT1, predict the site of integration of exogenous gamma-retroviruses
   with great accuracy and cell-type specificity. Statistical methods that
   were used to identify chromatin features that predict exogenous
   gamma-retrovirus integration site selection were exploited here to
   determine whether cell type-specific chromatin markers are enriched in
   the vicinity of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).
   Results: Among retro-elements in the human genome, the gamma-retrovirus
   HERV-H was highly associated with H3K4me3, though this association was
   only observed in embryonic stem (ES) cells (p < 10(-300)) and, to a
   lesser extent, in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. No significant
   association was observed in nearly 40 differentiated cell types, nor was
   any association observed with other retro-elements. Similar strong
   association was observed between HERV-H and the binding sites within ES
   cells for the pluripotency transcription factors NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2.
   NANOG binding sites were located within the HERV-H 5'LTR itself. OCT4
   and SOX2 binding sites were within 1 kB and 2 kB of the 5'LTR,
   respectively. In keeping with these observations, HERV-H RNA constituted
   2% of all poly A RNA in ES cells. As ES cells progressed down a
   differentiation pathway, the levels of HERV-H RNA decreased
   progressively. RNA-Seq datasets showed HERV-H transcripts to be over 5
   kB in length and to have the structure 5'LTR-gag-pro-3'LTR, with no
   evidence of splicing and no intact open reading frames.
   Conclusion: The developmental regulation of HERV-H expression, the
   association of HERV-H with binding sites for pluripotency transcription
   factors, and the extremely high levels of HERV-H RNA in human ES cells
   suggest that HERV-H contributes to pluripotency in human cells.
   Proximity of HERV-H to binding sites for pluripotency transcription
   factors within ES cells might be due to retention of the same chromatin
   features that determined the site of integration of the ancestral,
   exogenous, gamma-retrovirus that gave rise to HERV-H in the distant
   past. Retention of these markers, or, alternatively, recruitment of them
   to the site of the established provirus, may have acted post-integration
   to fix the provirus within the germ-line of the host species. Either
   way, HERV-H RNA provides a specific marker for pluripotency in human
   cells.

TI Tet1 controls meiosis by regulating meiotic gene expression
SO NATURE
AB Meiosis is a germ-cell-specific cell division process through which
   haploid gametes are produced for sexual reproduction(1). Before the
   initiation of meiosis, mouse primordial germ cells undergo a series of
   epigenetic reprogramming steps(2,3), including the global erasure of DNA
   methylation at the 5-position of cytosine (5mC) in CpG-rich DNA(4,5).
   Although several epigenetic regulators, such as Dnmt3l and the histone
   methyltransferases G9a and Prdm9, have been reported to be crucial for
   meiosis(6), little is known about how the expression of meiotic genes is
   regulated and how their expression contributes to normal meiosis. Using
   a loss-of-function approach in mice, here we show that the 5mC-specific
   dioxygenase Tet1 has an important role in regulating meiosis in mouse
   oocytes. Tet1 deficiency significantly reduces female germ-cell numbers
   and fertility. Univalent chromosomes and unresolved DNA double-strand
   breaks are also observed in Tet1-deficient oocytes. Tet1 deficiency does
   not greatly affect the genome-wide demethylation that takes place in
   primordial germ cells, but leads to defective DNA demethylation and
   decreased expression of a subset of meiotic genes. Our study thus
   establishes a function for Tet1 in meiosis and meiotic gene activation
   in female germ cells.

TI The Architecture of the Aquatic Environment and Its Influence on the
   Growth and Development of Tadpoles (Xenopus laevis)
SO COPEIA
AB Many ecological factors are known to influence anuran growth and
   development. However, little is known about the influence of the shape
   of the aquatic environment. We investigated how the size of the
   air-water interface (surface area), water depth, and partitioning the
   aquatic space independently affect the growth and development of
   tadpoles of Xenopus laevis. To do this, we used a series of pyramidal
   frustra and partitioned aquaria. In our experimental containers, as the
   surface area decreased the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased and
   the tadpoles' air-breathing rates increased. As the depth of the water
   increased, the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased and the
   tadpoles' air-breathing rates increased. When the aquatic space was
   vertically partitioned to form a maze with corridors either 2 cm or 4 cm
   wide, the tadpoles avoided the narrow spaces between the partitions.
   Neither varying the surface area, nor vertically partitioning the
   aquatic space, significantly affected the growth or development of the
   tadpoles. However, the tadpoles raised in the shallower containers grew
   significantly slower than the tadpoles raised in the deeper containers.
   Tadpoles raised in shallow water behaved differently than those raised
   in deeper water. Shallow water appeared to prevent the tadpoles from
   ascending normally to break the surface tension of the water and
   properly air-breathe. Instead, the tadpoles in the shallow containers
   often floated at the surface, rather than in their normal position in
   the water column. Our study suggests that shallow water, independent of
   other variables such as water volume or dissolved oxygen concentration,
   may detrimentally impact air-breathing tadpoles, since shallow water
   appears to physically impede the animals' ability to air-breathe.

TI Interactions between the nucleosome histone core and Arp8 in the INO80
   chromatin remodeling complex
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Actin-related protein Arp8 is a component of the INO80 chromatin
   remodeling complex. Yeast Arp8 (yArp8) comprises two domains: a 25-KDa
   N-terminal domain, found only in yeast, and a 75-KDa C-terminal domain
   (yArp8CTD) that contains the actin fold and is conserved across other
   species. The crystal structure shows that yArp8CTD contains three
   insertions within the actin core. Using a combination of biochemistry
   and EM, we show that Arp8 forms a complex with nucleosomes, and that the
   principal interactions are via the H3 and H4 histones, mediated through
   one of the yArp8 insertions. We show that recombinant yArp8 exists in
   monomeric and dimeric states, but the dimer is the biologically relevant
   form required for stable interactions with histones that exploits the
   twofold symmetry of the nucleosome core. Taken together, these data
   provide unique insight into the stoichiometry, architecture, and
   molecular interactions between components of the INO80 remodeling
   complex and nucleosomes, providing a first step toward building up the
   structure of the complex.

TI Genome-wide identification of enhancers in skeletal muscle: the role of
   MyoD1
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB To identify the compendium of distal regulatory elements that govern
   myogenic differentiation, we generated chromatin state maps based on
   histone modifications and recruitment of factors that typify enhancers
   in myoblasts and myotubes. We found a striking concordance between the
   locations of these newly defined enhancers, MyoD1-binding events, and
   noncoding RNA transcripts. These enhancers recruit several
   sequence-specific transcription factors in a spatially constrained
   manner around MyoD1-binding sites. Remarkably, MyoD1-null myoblasts show
   a wholesale loss of recruitment of these factors as well as diminished
   monomethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of H3K27 (H3K27ac) and
   reduced recruitment of Set7, an H3K4 monomethylase. Surprisingly, we
   found that H3K4me1, but not H3K27ac, could be restored by re-expression
   of MyoD1 in MyoD1(-/-) myoblasts, although re-expression of this factor
   in MyoD1-null myotubes restored both histone modifications. Our studies
   identified a role for MyoD1 in condition-specific enhancer assembly
   through recruitment of transcription factors and histone-modifying
   enzymes that shape muscle differentiation.

TI Synthesis, configuration assignment, and simultaneous quantification by
   liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, of
   dihydroanatoxin-a and dihydrohomoanatoxin-a together with the parent
   toxins, in axenic cyanobacterial strains and in environmental samples
SO TOXICON
AB We have synthesized cis- and trans-dihydroanatoxin-a and cis- and
   trans-dihydrohomoanatoxin-a using a short synthetic route. The relative
   configuration of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-cis-dihydroanatoxin-a was
   determined by X-ray crystallography, while that of
   N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-trans-dihydroanatoxin-a was confirmed by
   epimerization leading to the cis-diastereoisomer. The relative
   configuration of N-tert-butoxycarbonyltrans- and
   cis-dihydrohomoanatoxin-a was inferred from their NMR spectra. Using an
   optimized LC-MS/MS analytical method and pure standards we have
   simultaneously determined anatoxin-a, homoanatoxin-a and their
   dihydroderivatives in axenic strains of cyanobacteria and in
   environmental samples from the Tarn River, France. However, in these
   analytical conditions, the cis- and trans-dihydroanatoxin-a and cis- and
   trans-dihydrohomoanatoxin-a could not be separated. In axenic strains,
   the dihydroderivatives represented less than 3% of the total toxin
   content, while in field samples dihydroanatoxin-a represented from 17%
   to 90% of the total toxin content. Thus, the reduction of anatoxin-a to
   dihydroanatoxin-a is predominant in the environment. The ratio of
   anatoxin-a concentration over that of homoanatoxin-a in axenic strains
   was variable, and among the eight strains studied we found three
   exclusive anatoxin-a producers and five producers of homoanatoxin-a and
   anatoxin-a, the latter representing from 0.5% to 2.0% of the total. In
   the strains studied, we have amplified by PCR, and sequenced the region
   of anaG coding for the methylation domain proposed to be responsible for
   the formation of homoanatoxin-a. The sequences showed at least 88%
   identity and we could not relate the toxin profile of the strains to the
   sequence of the methylation domain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Genome-wide DNA hydroxymethylation changes are associated with
   neurodevelopmental genes in the developing human cerebellum
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of
   cytosine that has been suspected to be an important epigenetic
   modification in neurodevelopment. While DNA methylation dynamics have
   already been implicated during neurodevelopment, little is known about
   hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we report DNA
   hydroxymethylation dynamics during cerebellum development in the human
   brain. Overall, we find a positive correlation between 5-hmC levels and
   cerebellum development. Genome-wide profiling reveals that 5-hmC is
   highly enriched on specific gene regions including exons and especially
   the untranslated regions (UTRs), but it is depleted on introns and
   intergenic regions. Furthermore, we have identified fetus-specific and
   adult-specific differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of
   which overlap with genes and CpG island shores. Surprisingly, during
   development, DhMRs are highly enriched in genes encoding mRNAs that can
   be regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), some of
   which are disrupted in autism, as well as in many known autism genes.
   Our results suggest that 5-hmC-mediated epigenetic regulation may
   broadly impact the development of the human brain, and its dysregulation
   could contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental
   disorders. Accession number: Sequencing data have been deposited to GEO

TI Nuclear Repositioning Precedes Promoter Accessibility and Is Linked to
   the Switching Frequency of a Plasmodium falciparum Invasion Gene
SO CELL HOST & MICROBE
AB Variation of surface adhesins, such as the Plasmodium falciparum
   erythrocyte invasion ligand PfRh4, is critical for virulence and immune
   evasion in many microbes. While phenotypic switching is linked to
   transcriptional changes and chromatin function, the determinants of
   switching frequency remain poorly defined. By expressing a prokaryotic
   DNA methylase in P. falciparum, we directly assayed accessibility of
   transcriptionally active and silent chromatin at the PfRh4 locus.
   Parasites selected for in vivo PfRh4 activation show a reversible
   increase in promoter accessibility and exhibit perinuclear repositioning
   of the locus from a silent to a conserved activation domain. Forced
   activation of a proximal gene results in a similar repositioning of the
   PfRh4 locus, with a concomitant increase in PfRh4 activation in a
   subpopulation of parasites and promoter accessibility correlating with
   actively transcribed loci. Thus, nuclear repositioning is associated
   with increased P. falciparum switching frequency, while promoter
   accessibility is tightly linked to clonally active PfRh4 promoters.

   study was to investigate whether there is an association between the SNP
   rs 4704397 in the PDE8B gene and recurrent miscarriage.
   Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective case control study.
   188 cases with recurrent miscarriage were included and compared with 391
   controls who had delivered at least once and with no history of
   miscarriage or assisted reproduction.
   Results: No difference between cases and controls concerning age was
   found. Bivariate associations between homozygous A/A (OR 1.57, 95% CI
   0.98-2.52) as well as G/G carriers (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.02-2.25) of SNP rs
   4704397 in PDE8B and recurrent miscarriage were verified (test for trend
   across all 3 genotypes, p = 0.059). After adjustment for known
   confounders such as age, BMI and smoking the association between
   homozygous A/A (AOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01 - 2.64, p = 0.045) and G/G (AOR
   1.52, 95% CI 1.02 - 2.27, p = 0.039) carriers of SNP rs 4704397 in PDE8B
   and recurrent miscarriage remained.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is an association between
   homozygous A/A as well as homozygous G/G carriers of SNP rs 4704397 in
   PDE8B and recurrent miscarriage.

TI FUS stimulates microRNA biogenesis by facilitating co-transcriptional
   Drosha recruitment
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB microRNA abundance has been shown to depend on the amount of the
   microprocessor components or, in some cases, on specific auxiliary
   co-factors. In this paper, we show that the FUS/TLS (fused in
   sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma) protein, associated with familial
   forms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), contributes to the
   biogenesis of a specific subset of microRNAs. Among them, species with
   roles in neuronal function, differentiation and synaptogenesis were
   identified. We also show that FUS/TLS is recruited to chromatin at sites
   of their transcription and binds the corresponding pri-microRNAs.
   Moreover, FUS/TLS depletion leads to decreased Drosha level at the same
   chromatin loci. Limited FUS/TLS depletion leads to a reduced microRNA
   biogenesis and we suggest a possible link between FUS mutations
   affecting nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning of the protein and altered
   neuronal microRNA biogenesis in ALS pathogenesis. The EMBO Journal

TI The BAF53a subunit of SWI/SNF-like BAF complexes is essential for
   hemopoietic stem cell function
SO BLOOD
AB ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes are
   emerging as key regulators of embryonic and adult stem cell function.
   Particularly intriguing are the findings that specialized assemblies of
   BAF complexes are required for establishing and maintaining pluripotent
   and multipotent states in cells. However, little is known on the
   importance of these complexes in normal and leukemic hemopoiesis. Here
   we provide the first evidence that the actin-related protein BAF53a, a
   subunit of BAF complexes preferentially expressed in longterm
   repopulating stem cells, is essential for adult hemopoiesis. Conditional
   deletion of BAF53a resulted in multilineage BM failure, aplastic anemia,
   and rapid lethality. These severe hemopoietic defects originate from a
   proliferative impairment of BM HSCs and progenitors and decreased
   progenitor survival. Using hemopoietic chimeras, we show that the
   impaired function of BAF53a-deficient HSCs is cell-autonomous and
   independent of the BM microenvironment. Altogether, our studies
   highlight an unsuspected role for BAF chromatin remodeling complexes in
   the maintenance of HSC and progenitor cell properties. (Blood. 2012;

TI Stability of Nucleosomes Containing Homogenously Ubiquitylated H2A and
   H2B Prepared Using Semisynthesis
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones are an essential
   feature in the dynamic regulation of chromatin. One of these
   modifications, ubiquitylation, has been speculated to directly influence
   the stability of the nucleosome, which represents the basic building
   block of chromatin. Here we report a strategy for the semisynthesis of
   site-specifically ubiquitylated histone H2A (uH2A). This branched
   protein was generated through a three-piece expressed protein ligation
   approach including a traceless ligation at valine. uH2A could be
   efficiently incorporated into nucleosomes, thereby opening the way to
   detailed biochemical and biophysical studies on the function of this
   PTM. Accordingly, we used uH2A, as well as a previously generated
   ubiquitylated H2B, in chaperone-coupled nucleosome stability assays to
   demonstrate that the direct effect of ubiquitylated histones on
   nucleosomal stability is in fact modest.

TI The effect of two pre-cryopreservation single layer colloidal
   centrifugation protocols in combination with different freezing
   extenders on the fragmentation dynamics of thawed equine sperm DNA
SO ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA
AB Background: Variability among stallions in terms of semen
   cryopreservation quality renders it difficult to arrive at a
   standardized cryopreservation method. Different extenders and processing
   techniques (such us colloidal centrifugation) are used in order to
   optimize post-thaw sperm quality. Sperm chromatin integrity analysis is
   an effective tool for assessing such quality. The aim of the present
   study was to compare the effect of two single layer colloidal
   centrifugation protocols (prior to cryopreservation) in combination with
   three commercial freezing extenders on the post-thaw chromatin integrity
   of equine sperm samples at different post-thaw incubation (37 degrees C)
   times (i.e., their DNA fragmentation dynamics).
   Results: Post-thaw DNA fragmentation levels in semen samples subjected
   to either of the colloidal centrifugation protocols were significantly
   lower (p<0.05) immediately after thawing and after 4 h of incubation at
   37 degrees C compared to samples that underwent standard (control)
   centrifugation. The use of InraFreeze (R) extender was associated with
   significantly less DNA fragmentation than the use of Botu-Crio (R)
   extender at 6 h of incubation, and than the use of either Botu-Crio (R)
   or Gent (R) extender at 24 h of incubation (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that single layer colloidal
   centrifugation performed with extended or raw semen prior to
   cryopreservation reduces DNA fragmentation during the first four hours
   after thawing. Further studies are needed to determine the influence of
   freezing extenders on equine sperm DNA fragmentation dynamics.

TI Condensin, Chromatin Crossbarring and Chromosome Condensation
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB The processes underlying the large-scale reorganisation of chromatin in
   mitosis that form compact mitotic chromosomes and ensure the fidelity of
   chromosome segregation during cell division still remain obscure. The
   chromosomal condensin complex is a major molecular effector of
   chromosome condensation and segregation in diverse organisms ranging
   from bacteria to humans. Condensin is a large, evolutionarily conserved,
   multisubunit protein assembly composed of dimers of the structural
   maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of ATPases, clasped into
   topologically closed rings by accessory subunits. Condensin binds to DNA
   dynamically, in a poorly understood cycle of ATP-modulated
   conformational changes, and exhibits the ability to positively supercoil
   DNA. During mitosis, condensin is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent
   kinase (CDK), Polo and Aurora B kinases in a manner that correlates with
   changes in its localisation, dynamics and supercoiling activity. Here we
   review the reported architecture, biochemical activities and regulators
   of condensin. We compare models of bacterial and eukaryotic condensins
   in order to uncover conserved mechanistic principles of condensin action
   and to propose a model for mitotic chromosome condensation.

TI Skeletal muscle mitochondrial energetics in obesity and type 2 diabetes
   mellitus: Endocrine aspects
SO BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB During the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, skeletal muscle is a
   major site of insulin resistance. The latter has been linked to
   mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired fatty acid oxidation. Some
   hormones like insulin, thyroid hormones and adipokines (e.g., leptin,
   adiponectin) have positive effects on muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics
   through their direct or indirect effects on mitochondrial biogenesis,
   mitochondrial protein expression, mitochondrial enzyme activities and/or
   AMPK pathway activation - all of which can improve fatty acid oxidation.
   It is therefore not surprising that treatment with these hormones has
   been proposed to improve muscle and whole body insulin sensitivity.
   However, treatment of diabetic patients with leptin and adiponectin has
   no effect on muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics showing resistance to
   these hormones during type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, treatment with most
   thyroid hormones has unexpectedly revealed negative effects on muscle
   insulin sensitivity. Future research should focus on development of
   agents tat improve metabolic dysfunction downstream of hormone
   receptors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Exploring the genetics of nestling personality traits in a wild
   passerine bird: testing the phenotypic gambit
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB When several personality traits covary, they form a behavioral syndrome.
   Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of a behavioral syndrome
   requires knowledge of its genetic underpinning. At present, our
   understanding of the genetic basis of behavioral syndromes is largely
   restricted to domestic and laboratory animals. Wild behavioral syndromes
   are mostly inferred on the basis of phenotypic correlations, and thus
   make the "phenotypic gambit" of assuming that these phenotypic
   correlations capture the underlying genetic correlations. On the basis
   of 3 years of reciprocal cross-fostering of 2896 nestlings of 271
   families within a pedigreed population, we show that the nestling
   personality traits handling aggression, breathing rate, and docility are
   heritable (h(2) = 16-29%), and often have a pronounced "nest-of-rearing"
   variance component (10-15%), but a relatively small "nest-of-origin"
   variance component (0-7%). The three nestling personality traits form a
   behavioral syndrome on the phenotypic and genetic level. Overall, the
   phenotypic correlations provide a satisfactory description of the
   genetic ones, but significantly underestimate the magnitude of one of
   the pairwise genetic correlations, which mirrors the conclusion based on
   domestic and laboratory studies.

TI Sperm Nuclear Decondensation Induction Capacity of In Vitro and In Vivo
   Matured Canine Oocytes
SO REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB Contents The objectives of this study were to evaluate the sperm nuclear
   decondensation capacity of ovulated and in vitro-matured (IVM) canine
   oocytes during different culture times and correlate this decondensation
   ability with the state of oocyte nuclear maturation in vitro and in
   vivo. Fresh ejaculates from three dogs were used for in vitro
   fertilization (IVF). Dog spermatozoa were cocultured with ovulated or
   IVM oocytes after each culture period (0, 48, 72 and 96 h) for 24 h. The
   nuclear stage of the oocytes and the appearance of the sperm nucleus
   were determined, and data were analysed with a chi-square test. The
   rates of decondensation and meiotic development in IVM oocytes increased
   up to 72 h of culture. In contrast, almost all in vivo-matured oocytes
   showed MII nuclear stage and sperm chromatin decondensation. The
   percentages of oocytes at MII stage were much lower (p < 0.05) in all
   IVM groups compared with ovulated oocytes; the rate of sperm chromatin
   decondensation was higher in ovulated oocytes than in those matured in
   vitro. Thus, IVM canine oocytes are able to decondense the sperm
   chromatin during IVF, and this ability increases with time.
   Nevertheless, sperm chromatin decondensation is less efficient than in
   ovulated oocytes and may not be completely synchronized with nuclear
   development as it occurs in vivo.

TI ATX1-Generated H3K4me3 Is Required for Efficient Elongation of
   Transcription, Not Initiation, at ATX1-Regulated Genes
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Tri-methylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with
   transcriptionally active genes, but its function in the transcription
   process is still unclear. Point mutations in the catalytic domain of
   ATX1 (ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX1), a H3K4 methyltransferase, and RNAi
   knockdowns of subunits of the AtCOMPASS-like (Arabidopsis Complex
   Proteins Associated with Set) were used to address this question. We
   demonstrate that both ATX1 and AtCOMPASS-like are required for high
   level accumulation of TBP (TATA-binding protein) and Pol II at promoters
   and that this requirement is independent of the catalytic histone
   modifying activity. However, the catalytic function is critically
   required for transcription as H3K4me3 levels determine the efficiency of
   transcription elongation. The roles of H3K4me3, ATX1, and AtCOMPASS-like
   may be of a general relevance for transcription of Trithorax-activated
   eukaryotic genes.

TI Distinct contributions of MSL complex subunits to the transcriptional
   enhancement responsible for dosage compensation in Drosophila
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The regulatory mechanism of dosage compensation is the paramount example
   of epigenetic regulation at the chromosomal level. In Drosophila, this
   mechanism, designed to compensate for the difference in the dosage of
   X-linked genes between the sexes, depends on the MSL complex that
   enhances the transcription of the single dose of these genes in males.
   We have investigated the function of various subunits of the complex in
   mediating dosage compensation. Our results confirm that the highly
   enriched specific acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 of compensated
   genes by the histone acetyl transferase subunit MOF induces a more
   disorganized state of their chromatin. We have determined that the
   association of the MSL complex reduces the level of negative
   supercoiling of the deoxyribonucleic acid of compensated genes, and we
   have defined the role that the other subunits of the complex play in
   this topological modification. Lastly, we have analyzed the potential
   contribution of ISWI-containing remodeling complexes to the architecture
   of compensated chromatin, and we suggest a role for this remodeling
   factor in dosage compensation.

TI The Cell Cycle Timing of Centromeric Chromatin Assembly in Drosophila
   Meiosis Is Distinct from Mitosis Yet Requires CAL1 and CENP-C
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB CENP-A (CID in flies) is the histone H3 variant essential for centromere
   specification, kinetochore formation, and chromosome segregation during
   cell division. Recent studies have elucidated major cell cycle
   mechanisms and factors critical for CENP-A incorporation in mitosis,
   predominantly in cultured cells. However, we do not understand the
   roles, regulation, and cell cycle timing of CENP-A assembly in somatic
   tissues in multicellular organisms and in meiosis, the specialized cell
   division cycle that gives rise to haploid gametes. Here we investigate
   the timing and requirements for CID assembly in mitotic tissues and male
   and female meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster, using fixed and live
   imaging combined with genetic approaches. We find that CID assembly
   initiates at late telophase and continues during G1 phase in somatic
   tissues in the organism, later than the metaphase assembly observed in
   cultured cells. Furthermore, CID assembly occurs at two distinct cell
   cycle phases during male meiosis: prophase of meiosis I and after exit
   from meiosis II, in spermatids. CID assembly in prophase I is also
   conserved in female meiosis. Interestingly, we observe a novel decrease
   in CID levels after the end of meiosis I and before meiosis II, which
   correlates temporally with changes in kinetochore organization and
   orientation. We also demonstrate that CID is retained on mature sperm
   despite the gross chromatin remodeling that occurs during protamine
   exchange. Finally, we show that the centromere proteins CAL1 and CENP-C
   are both required for CID assembly in meiosis and normal progression
   through spermatogenesis. We conclude that the cell cycle timing of CID
   assembly in meiosis is different from mitosis and that the efficient
   propagation of CID through meiotic divisions and on sperm is likely to
   be important for centromere specification in the developing zygote.

TI Derivation of a chronic oral reference dose for cobalt
SO REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Cobalt (Co) is an essential element in humans as a component of vitamin
   B12. However, at high levels Co exposure has been shown to have
   detrimental effects. This study was designed to identify a chronic oral
   reference dose (RfD) for Co. Currently available data indicate that
   non-cancer health effects associated with Co exposure may include
   hematological, neurological, immunological, reproductive,
   cardiovascular, and endocrine responses. This analysis employs the
   standard US EPA risk assessment methodology for establishing a chronic
   RfD. In this analysis, the Jaimet and Thode (1955) 10-week, multiple
   dose human study of thyroid effects (decreased iodine uptake) in
   children was determined to be the most robust and sensitive study for
   identifying a potential point of departure dose (POD). A dose of 0.9 mg
   Co/kg-day was chosen as the POD. Consistent with the US EPA's previous
   derivation of the perchlorate RfD, which is also based on decreased
   iodine uptake in humans, we considered several uncertainly factors
   (UFs), and determined that a factor of 10 for human variability was
   appropriate, as well as a factor of three for database adequacy.
   Applying an aggregate uncertainty factor of 30 to the POD yields a
   chronic oral RfD of 0.03 mg/kg-day. We believe this value would be
   protective of non-cancer health effects in the general population for a
   lifetime of daily exposure to Co. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI The association between neonatal thyroxine and craniosynostosis, Texas,
   2004-2007
SO BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND Craniosynostosis (CS), a structural anomaly characterized by
   premature fusion of cranial sutures, occurs in 1 in 2000 live births.
   Associations of CS with the thyroid have been reported. Neonatal thyroid
   hormone (T4) is evaluated nationally at birth by the Newborn Screening
   Program (NBS). This study evaluated the relationship between NBS T4
   levels and craniosynostosis. METHODS Live-born singleton babies born in
   2004 through 2007 were identified through the Texas Birth Defects
   Registry (499 cases) and Texas Bureau of Vital Statistics (3570
   controls) and successfully linked to analyte data available in the Texas
   NBS Database. Cases were classified based on the absence of other major
   defects (isolated cases, n = 382) and suture(s) involved. Mean T4 levels
   were compared between controls and cases (overall and stratified by
   classification). T4 levels were stratified by quintiles to evaluate
   differences between cases and controls within quintiles. The diagnostic
   utility of NBS T4 was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic
   (ROC) curves. RESULTS Mean T4 levels were lower in isolated cases (16.89
   mu g/dl) than in controls (17.77 mu g/dl; p = 0.0004). This trend
   persisted for sagittal (16.69 mu g/dl; p = 0.002) and metopic (16.83 mu
   g/dl; p = 0.042) CS. When stratified by quintiles, 54% of isolated
   lambdoid CS were in the first quintile compared to controls (p = 0.012).
   ROC area under the curve (AUC) was approximately 0.55 for all
   classifications except lambdoid (AUC = 0.73). CONCLUSION NBS T4 levels
   were slightly lower among cases with nearly half of all lambdoid CS
   having T4 levels in the lowest quintile. However, overall NBS T4 levels
   are not suitable for potential screening or diagnostic application.

   microdroplets by IR laser
SO MICROFLUIDICS AND NANOFLUIDICS
AB This study presents an optical microfluidic platform and method for
   performing real-time polymerase chain reactions of MDA-MB-231 breast
   cancer cell DNA within droplet-in-oil micro-reactors. Illumination of
   the droplets using a low-power (20-40 mW) infrared (IR) laser at 1,460
   nm provides a simple approach for droplet manipulation and rapid thermal
   cycling. The nanoliter droplet volumes allow for extremely fast
   amplification times, from cell lysis to assay completion in 15 min or
   less. Droplets containing lysis buffer and subsequently master mix
   solutions are optically positioned in mineral oil to coalesce with
   droplets containing live cells on a Petri dish surface for
   reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). The optical
   PCR setup is also shown to amplify DNA in droplets containing single or
   multiple cells and distinguish between methylated and unmethylated BRCA1
   promoters in microdroplets containing sample at the single-cell level.
   Melting curves generated using IR heating indicates a melting
   temperature of 86 degrees C for the 255-bp amplicon. The results are
   consistent with standard PCR and methylation-specific protocols
   performed in a commercial system. The simplicity of the droplet-in-oil
   Petri dish platform provides an easy and efficient tool for DNA analysis
   from live cells, and can be integrated with other microfluidic
   technologies for complex and large-scale assays.

TI Demethylation initiated by ROS1 glycosylase involves random sliding
   along DNA
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Active DNA demethylation processes play a critical role in shaping
   methylation patterns, yet our understanding of the mechanisms involved
   is still fragmented and incomplete. REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) is a
   prototype member of a family of plant 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases
   that initiate active DNA demethylation through a base excision repair
   pathway. As ROS1 binds DNA non-specifically, we have critically tested
   the hypothesis that facilitated diffusion along DNA may contribute to
   target location by the enzyme. We have found that dissociation of ROS1
   from DNA is severely restricted when access to both ends is obstructed
   by tetraloops obstacles. Unblocking any end facilitates protein
   dissociation, suggesting that random surface sliding is the main route
   to a specific target site. We also found that removal of the basic
   N-terminal domain of ROS1 significantly impairs the sliding capacity of
   the protein. Finally, we show that sliding increases the catalytic
   efficiency of ROS1 on 5-meC:G pairs, but not on T:G mispairs, thus
   suggesting that the enzyme achieves recognition and excision of its two
   substrate bases by different means. A model is proposed to explain how
   ROS1 finds its potential targets on DNA.

TI Induced transcription results in local changes in chromatin structure,
   replication timing, and DNA polytenization in a site of intercalary
   heterochromatin
SO CHROMOSOMA
AB In salivary gland polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, the
   regions of intercalary heterochromatin are characterized by late
   replication, under-replication, and genetic silencing. Using Gal4/UAS
   system, we induced transcription of sequences adjacent to transgene
   insertions in the band 11A6-9. This activation resulted in a loss of
   "silent" and appearance of "active" epigenetic marks, recruitment of RNA
   polymerase II, and formation of a puff. The activated region is now
   early replicating and shows increased level of DNA polytenization.
   Notably, all these changes are restricted to the area around the
   inserts, whereas the rest of the band remains inactive and late
   replicating. Although only a short area near the insertion site is
   transcribed, it results in an "open" chromatin conformation in a much
   broader region. We conclude that regions of intercalary heterochromatin
   do not form stand-alone units of late replication and under-replication.
   Every part of such regions can be activated and polytenized
   independently of other parts.

TI Single-Incision Transaxillary Robotic Thyroidectomy: Challenges and
   Limitations in a North American Population
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB Objective. We reviewed our initial experience with robotic thyroidectomy
   to identify challenges and limitations of this new surgical approach
   when applied to a North American population.
   Study Design. Case series.
   Setting. Academic institution.
   Subjects/Methods. Retrospective review of 18 consecutive robotic thyroid
   lobectomies performed from February 2010 to April 2012 involving 16
   female patients. Two patients underwent robot-assisted completion
   thyroidectomy a few months following the initial thyroid surgery, one
   for cancer and the other for goiter.
   Results. Median age was 47.5 years (range, 18-62 years), and median body
   mass index was 28.7 (range, 19.4-44.5). Median thyroid nodule size was
   2.9 cm (range, 1.1-4.7 cm). All but 1 case (6%) was performed
   successfully via single axillary incision. There was no conversion to an
   open approach. Median operative time was 170 minutes (range, 95-220
   minutes), and median blood loss was 12.5 mL (range, 5-75 mL).
   Complications occurred in 4 cases (22%) to include temporary vocal cord
   pareses (n = 3) and a postoperative hematoma that required exploration.
   Median hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-3 days).
   Conclusion. Single-incision transaxillary robotic thyroidectomy can be
   technically challenging in North American patients with a larger body
   frame due to difficulty in optimal placement of all 4 robotic
   instruments via a single axillary incision. All 3 cases of temporary
   vocal cord paresis occurred early in our experience and may have been
   due to our relative inexperience with this new approach and associated
   instrumentation. Other limitations include less than optimal
   visualization of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the contralateral lobe
   as well as poor access to the substernal region.

TI Engineering the DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase reaction for
   sequence-specific labeling of DNA
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB DNA methyltransferases catalyse the transfer of a methyl group from the
   ubiquitous cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) onto specific
   target sites on DNA and play important roles in organisms from bacteria
   to humans. AdoMet analogs with extended propargylic side chains have
   been chemically produced for methyltransferase-directed transfer of
   activated groups (mTAG) onto DNA, although the efficiency of reactions
   with synthetic analogs remained low. We performed steric engineering of
   the cofactor pocket in a model DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase
   (C5-MTase), M. HhaI, by systematic replacement of three non-essential
   positions, located in two conserved sequence motifs and in a variable
   region, with smaller residues. We found that double and triple
   replacements lead to a substantial improvement of the transalkylation
   activity, which manifests itself in a mild increase of cofactor binding
   affinity and a larger increase of the rate of alkyl transfer. These
   effects are accompanied with reduction of both the stability of the
   product DNA-M. HhaI-AdoHcy complex and the rate of methylation,
   permitting competitive mTAG labeling in the presence of AdoMet.
   Analogous replacements of two conserved residues in M. HpaII and
   M2.Eco31I also resulted in improved transalkylation activity attesting a
   general applicability of the homology-guided engineering to the C5-MTase
   family and expanding the repertoire of sequence-specific tools for
   covalent in vitro and ex vivo labeling of DNA.

TI Chromomeres revisited
SO CHROMOSOME RESEARCH
AB The history of studies on the chromomeres of lampbrush chromosomes is
   outlined and evidence for the nature and function of these structures is
   collected and summarised. Chromomeres and their associated loops on
   lampbrush chromosomes are not genetic units although in some special
   cases, they consist of specific families of repeated DNA sequences. The
   emergence of a chromomeric organisation coincides with the onset and
   intensification of transcription on lampbrush loops. Modern molecular
   studies have provided evidence that the chromatin of lampbrush
   chromomeres differs in several important respects from that of condensed
   metaphase chromosomes. It is in a highly dynamic state that facilitates
   localised transcription whilst keeping the chromosome safe from
   structural changes that might impede its orderly progression up to and
   through meiotic metaphase 1. Lampbrush chromosomes (LBCs) are a
   physically induced phenomenon, facilitated by the selective absence of
   molecular factors that would interfere with their main transcriptional
   role. LBC morphology is highly dynamic and driven by transcriptive
   activity.

TI Lag effect of microclimatic conditions on DNA integrity of frozen-thawed
   bovine sperm
SO ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
   microclimatic conditions on DNA integrity of bovine sperm. DNA
   fragmentation of frozen-thawed sperm was analyzed in monthly semen
   samples of nine AI bulls ejaculating in weekly routine for one year. The
   extent of DNA fragmentation was determined using the Sperm Chromatin
   Structure Assay (SCSA (TM)) and quantified by the DNA fragmentation
   index (DFI) and the percentage of sperm showing high DFI values (%DFI)
   immediately (0 h) and 3 h (3 h) after thawing. Microclimatic factors
   (ambient air temperature, relative humidity, dew point) were recorded in
   hourly intervals throughout the year. Their mean values were calculated
   for seven different time periods (up to day 56) preceding ejaculation
   (day 0). DFI (P < 0.01) and its relative change between 0 h and 3 h (P <
   0.05) were related to the set of microclimatic parameters recorded the
   last 11 days and from day 49 to 43 prior to ejaculation, respectively. A
   significant relationship was detected between %DFI and microclimatic
   parameters of days 35-29 preceding ejaculation (P < 0.05), while the
   degree of change of %DFI from Oh to 3 h was related to microclimatic
   parameters recorded from day 28 to 22 before ejaculation (P < 0.05). Dew
   point and relative humidity appeared to be the strongest and weakest
   predictors of DNA integrity, respectively. In conclusion, the results of
   the present study showed a lag effect of microclimate on DNA integrity
   of frozen-thawed bovine sperm. However, microclimatic parameters of a
   single time period before ejaculation could not be identified as the
   source of variation of different SCSA parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI 5-Aza-2 '-deoxycytidine-induced genome rearrangements are mediated by
   DNMT1
SO ONCOGENE
AB Observations that genome-wide DNA hypomethylation induces genome
   instability and tumors in animals caution against the indiscriminate use
   of demethylating agents, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC).
   Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring a lacZ mutational
   reporter construct that allows the quantification and characterization
   of a wide range of mutational events, we found that, in addition to
   demethylation, treatment with 5-Aza-dC induces gamma-H2AX expression, a
   marker for DNA breaks, and both point mutations and genome
   rearrangements. To gain insight into the source of these mutations, we
   first tested the hypothesis that the mutagenic effect of 5-Aza-dC may be
   directly mediated through the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) covalently
   trapped in 5-Aza-dC-substituted DNA. Knockdown of DNMT1 resulted in
   increased resistance to the cytostatic effects of 5-Aza-dC, delayed
   onset of g-H2AX expression and a significant reduction in the frequency
   of genome rearrangements. There was no effect on the 5-Aza-dC-induced
   point mutations. An alternative mechanism for 5-Aza-dC-induced
   demethylation and genome rearrangements via activation-induced cytidine
   deaminase (AID) followed by base excision repair (BER) was found not to
   be involved. That is, 5-Aza-dC treatment did not significantly induce
   AID expression and inhibition of BER did not reduce the frequency of
   genome rearrangements. Thus, our results indicate that the formation of
   DNMT1 adducts is the prevalent mechanism of 5-Aza-dC-induced genome
   rearrangements, although hypomethylation per se may still contribute. As
   the therapeutic effects of 5-Aza-dC greatly depend on the presence of
   DNMT1, the expression level of DNA methyltransferases in tumors may
   serve as a prognostic factor for the efficacy of 5-Aza-dC treatment.

TI Hormonal regulation of the death commitment in programmed cell death of
   the silkworm anterior silk glands
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY
AB During larval-pupal transformation, the anterior silk glands (ASGs) of
   the silkworm Bombyx mori undergo programmed cell death (PCD) triggered
   by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Under standard in vitro culture conditions
   (0.3 ml of medium with 1 mu M 20E), ASGs of the fourth-instar larvae do
   not undergo PCD in response to 20E. Similarly, larvae of the fifth
   instar do not respond to 20E through day 5 of the instar (V5). However,
   ASGs of V6 die when challenged by 20E, indicating that the glands might
   be destined to die before V6 but that a death commitment is not yet
   present. When we increased the volume of culture medium for one gland
   from 0.3 to 9 ml, V5 ASGs underwent PCD. We examined the response of
   ASGs to 20E every day by culturing them in 9 ml of medium and found that
   ASGs on and after V2 were fully responsive to 20E. Because pupal
   commitment is associated with juvenile hormone (JH), the corpora allata
   (a JH secretory organ) were removed on day 3 of the fourth larval instar
   (IV3), and their ASGs on V0 were cultured with 20E. Removal of the
   corpora allata allowed the V0 larval ASGs to respond to 20E with PCD. In
   contrast, topical application of a JH analogue inhibited the response to
   20E when applied on or before V5. We conclude that the acquisition of
   responsiveness to 20E precedes the loss of JH sensitivity, and that the
   death commitment in ASGs occurs between V5 and 6. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   studied over 24 months (February 2009 to January 2011) at Gran Canaria
   through the gonad index and a combination of macro- and microscopic

TI LCR 5 ' hypersensitive site specificity for globin gene activation
   within the active chromatin hub
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) of the human beta-globin locus
   control region (LCR) may function as part of an LCR holocomplex within a
   larger active chromatin hub (ACH). Differential activation of the globin
   genes during development may be controlled in part by preferential
   interaction of each gene with specific individual HSs during globin gene
   switching, a change in conformation of the LCR holocomplex, or both. To
   distinguish between these possibilities, human beta-globin locus yeast
   artificial chromosome (beta-YAC) lines were produced in which the
   epsilon-globin gene was replaced with a second marked beta-globin gene
   (beta(m)), coupled to an intact LCR, a 5'HS3 complete deletion
   (50'Lambda HS3) or a 5'HS3 core deletion (5'Lambda HS3c). The 5'Lambda
   HS3c mice expressed beta(m)-globin throughout development; gamma-globin
   was co-expressed in the embryonic yolk sac, but not in the fetal liver;
   and wild-type beta-globin was co-expressed in adult mice. Although the
   5'HS3 core was not required for beta(m)-globin expression, previous work
   showed that the 5'HS3 core is necessary for epsilon-globin expression
   during embryonic erythropoiesis. A similar phenotype was observed in
   5'HS complete deletion mice, except beta(m)-globin expression was higher
   during primitive erythropoiesis and gamma-globin expression continued
   into fetal definitive erythropoiesis. These data support a site
   specificity model of LCR HS-globin gene interaction.

   Ossifications in the Integument Within Ceratophryid Frogs (Anura,
   Ceratophryidae)
SO ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY
   BIOLOGY
AB Ceratophryidae represent a monophyletic group of terrestrial and aquatic
   frogs inhabiting lowlands of South America where they are more diverse
   in semiarid environments of the Chaco region. Adult morphology of
   ceratophryids presents some features associated to terrestrial and
   fossorial life such as hyper-ossified skulls, spade feet for digging,
   among others. For anurans, different mineralized structures have been
   described in the integument as calcium reservoirs and related to the
   terrestrial life and water balance (e.g., the calcified layer and dermal
   ossifications). We describe the ontogeny of the integument in the three
   genera of ceratophryids (Chacophrys, Ceratophrys, and Lepidobatrachus)
   that inhabit in semiarid environments. Data obtained demonstrated the
   early acquisition of metamorphic transformations in the integument
   layers in larvae of Ceratophrys cranwelli and Lepidobatrachus spp. and a
   continuous increment in the thickness of them up to old postmetamorphic
   stages. The integument of ceratophryids develops calcium deposits as the
   calcified layer during postmetamorphic stages. Furthermore, dorsal
   shields are also present in adult stages independently of terrestrial
   versus aquatic lifestyles. While the calcified layer seems to be a
   feature of a fully developed integument, in which their layers have
   acquired the adult thickness, dorsal shields develop at premetamorphic
   stages in L. llanensis and postmetamorphic individuals of C. cranwelli.
   In ceratophryids, similar to other studied taxa (e.g., Brachycephalus
   spp.) dorsal shields develop via an intramembranous ossification in
   which the calcified layer does not precede its differentiation. Within
   anurans, the occurrence of dorsal shields in the monophyletic
   ceratophryids suggested a distinctive evolutionary history in the
   lineage. Anat Rec, 295:2089-2103, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Domains of alpha- and beta-globin genes in the context of the
   structural-functional organization of the eukaryotic genome
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB The eukaryotic cell genome has a multilevel regulatory system of gene
   expression that includes stages of preliminary activation of genes or of
   extended genomic regions (switching them to potentially active states)
   and stages of final activation of promoters and maintaining their active
   status in cells of a certain lineage. Current views on the regulatory
   systems of transcription in eukaryotes have been formed based on results
   of systematic studies on a limited number of model systems, in
   particular, on the alpha- and beta-globin gene domains of vertebrates.
   Unexpectedly, these genomic domains harboring genes responsible for the
   synthesis of different subunits of the same protein were found to have a
   fundamentally different organization inside chromatin. In this review,
   we analyze specific features of the organization of the alpha- and
   beta-globin gene domains in vertebrates, as well as principles of
   activities of the regulatory systems in these domains. In the final part
   of the review, we attempt to answer the question how the evolution of
   alpha- and beta-globin genes has led to segregation of these genes into
   two distinct types of chromatin domains situated on different
   chromosomes.

   transcription associated with epilepsy are mediated via modulation of
   chromatin structure. One transcription factor in particular, repressor
   element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), has received a lot of
   attention due to the possibility that it may control fundamental
   transcription patterns that drive circuit excitability, seizures, and
   epilepsy. REST represses a suite of genes in the nervous system by
   utilizing nuclear protein complexes that were originally identified as
   mediators of epigenetic inheritance. Epigenetics has traditionally
   referred to mechanisms that allow a heritable change in gene expression
   in the absence of DNA mutation. However a more contemporaneous
   definition acknowledges that many of the mechanisms used to perpetuate
   epigenetic traits in dividing cells are utilized by neurons to control
   activity-dependent gene expression. This review surveys what is
   currently understood about the role of epigenetic mechanisms in
   epilepsy. We discuss how REST controls gene expression to affect circuit
   excitability and neurogenesis in epilepsy. We also discuss how the
   repressor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and activator cyclic AMP
   response element binding protein (CREB) regulate neuronal activity and
   are themselves controlled by activity. Finally we highlight possible
   future directions in the field of epigenetics and epilepsy.

TI Zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model for investigating dietary toxic
   effects of deoxynivalenol contamination in aquaculture feeds
SO FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB The effects of feeding six diets spiked with increasing levels of DON
   for 45 days to zebrafish (Danio rerio) on performance and liver gene
   biomarkers were investigated. In addition long term effects on
   fecundity, offspring larvae swimming activity and global DNA methylation
   in embryos were investigated. Zebrafish performance was not affected.
   Liver CYP1A mRNA levels were significantly higher in fish fed 2.0 ppm
   DON compared to the control group, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.5 ppm group. Gene
   transcripts of CuZn SOD and Cyclin Cl increased with increasing content
   of dietary DON. The percentage of 5-methylcytosine in embryos did not
   differ and was 7.0-7.1% across the groups. Fecundity showed a biphasic
   response pattern. Interestingly, fish fed 1.5 ppm DON had 22% higher
   fecundity compared to control. A trend towards increased larvae swimming
   activity was seen in the high DON group. Our data suggest that DON is
   detoxified in the liver through the phase 1 system resulting in a
   disturbance in the oxidative balance. We do not know if effects observed
   on fecundity and larvae swimming activity are attributed to a direct
   interaction of DON with the reproductive organ or secondary to the
   maternal/paternal liver oxidative imbalance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Mechanisms of environmental influence on human autoimmunity: A national
   institute of environmental health sciences expert panel workshop
SO JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY
AB The mechanisms leading to autoimmune diseases remain largely unknown
   despite numerous lines of experimental inquiry and epidemiological
   evidence. The growing number of genome-wide association studies and the
   largely incomplete concordance for autoimmune diseases in monozygotic
   twins support the role of the environment (including infectious agents
   and chemicals) in the breakdown of tolerance leading to autoimmunity via
   numerous mechanisms. The present article reviews the major theories on
   the mechanisms of the environmental influence on autoimmunity by
   addressing the different degrees of confidence that characterize our
   knowledge. The theories discussed herein include (i) the role of innate
   immunity mediated by toll-like receptors in triggering the autoimmune
   adaptive response characterizing the observed pathology; (ii) changes in
   spleen marginal zone B cells in autoantibody production with particular
   focus on the B10 subpopulation; (iii) Th17 cell differentiation and T
   regulatory cells in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor model; (iv) self
   antigen changes induced by chemical and infectious agents which could
   break tolerance by post-translational modifications and molecular
   mimicry; and finally (v) epigenetic changes, particularly DNA
   methylation, that are induced by environmental stimuli and may
   contribute to autoimmunity initiation. We are convinced that these
   working hypotheses, in most cases supported by solid evidence, should be
   viewed in parallel with animal models and epidemiological observations
   to provide a comprehensive picture of the environmental causes of
   autoimmune diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Recognition of asymmetrically dimethylated arginine by TDRD3
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA) marks are placed on histones and the
   C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) and serve as a
   signal for recruitment of appropriate transcription and processing
   factors in coordination with transcription cycle. In contrast to other
   Tudor domain-containing proteins, Tudor domain-containing protein 3
   (TDRD3) associates selectively with the aDMA marks but not with other
   methylarginine motifs. Here, we report the solution structure of the
   Tudor domain of TDRD3 bound to the asymmetrically dimethylated CTD. The
   structure and mutational analysis provide a molecular basis for how
   TDRD3 recognizes the aDMA mark. The unique aromatic cavity of the TDRD3
   Tudor domain with a tyrosine in position 566 creates a selectivity
   filter for the aDMA residue. Our work contributes to the understanding
   of substrate selectivity rules of the Tudor aromatic cavity, which is an
   important structural motif for reading of methylation marks.

TI A Plasmodium multi-domain protein possesses multiple inositol phosphate
   kinase activities
SO MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY
AB The synchronization of intraerythrocytic maturation of Plasmodium
   parasites is an important factor in the malaria infection process.
   Synchronization is mediated by inositol phosphate (InsP(x))-induced
   Ca(2+)-release from internal stores. To further investigate the InsP(x)
   metabolism in these parasites a Plasmodium protein possessing inositol
   phosphate kinase (IPK) activity was recombinantly expressed, purified
   and enzymatically characterized for the first time. Its main activity is
   the conversion of the Ca(2+)-releasing second messenger Ins(1,4,5)P(3)
   to Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4), an important factor in chromatin remodeling and
   also in Ca(2+)-release. This protein possesses several additional IPK
   activities pointing to a potential role as inositol phosphate
   multikinase. Interestingly, we have also identified three putative
   subdomains of histone deacetylase in this protein possibly linking
   InsP(x)- and acetylation-mediated transcription regulation. Furthermore,
   we examined the inhibitory potential of >40 polyphenolic substances
   against its kinase activity. Because of the important role of
   InsP(x)-induced Ca(2+)-release in the development of Plasmodium
   parasites, IPKs are interesting targets for novel antimalarial
   approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI SOX1 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Antagonizing the
   WNT/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO HEPATOLOGY
AB Oncogenic activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is common
   in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our recent studies have demonstrated
   that SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 1 (SOX1) and secreted
   frizzled-related proteins are concomitantly promoter-hypermethylated,
   and this might lead to abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway
   in HCC. SOX1 encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation
   of embryonic development and cell fate determination. However, the
   expression and functional role of SOX1 in HCC remains unclear. In this
   study, we confirmed via quantitative methylation-specific polymerase
   chain reaction that SOX1 was frequently downregulated through promoter
   hypermethylation in HCC cells and tissues. Overexpression of SOX1 by a
   constitutive or inducible approach could suppress cell proliferation,
   colony formation, and invasion ability in HCC cell lines, as well as
   tumor growth in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice.
   Conversely, knockdown of SOX1 by withdrawal of doxycycline could
   partially restore cell proliferation and colony formation in HCC cells.
   We used a T cell factor (TCF)-responsive luciferase reporter assay and
   western blot analysis to prove that SOX1 could regulate TCF-responsive
   transcriptional activity and inhibit the expression of Wnt downstream
   genes. Furthermore, we used glutathione S-transferase pull-down,
   co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy to demonstrate that SOX1
   could interact with beta-catenin but not with the beta-catenin/TCF
   complex. Moreover, restoration of the expression of SOX1 induces
   significant cellular senescence in Hep3B cells. Conclusion: Our data
   show that a developmental gene, SOX1, may function as a tumor suppressor
   by interfering with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the development of
   HCC. (HEPATOLOGY 2012;56:2277-2287)

TI Hepatitis B Virus X Protein Stimulates Gene Expression Selectively From
   Extrachromosomal DNA Templates
SO HEPATOLOGY
AB Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for
   liver cancer development. HBV encodes the hepatitis B virus X (HBx)
   protein that promotes transcription of the viral episomal DNA genome by
   the host cell RNA polymerase II. Here we provide evidence that HBx
   accomplishes this task by a conserved and unusual mechanism. Thus, HBx
   strongly stimulates expression of transiently transfected reporter
   constructs, regardless of the enhancer and promoter sequences. This
   activity invariably requires HBx binding to the cellular UV-damaged DDB1
   E3 ubiquitin ligase, suggesting a common mechanism. Unexpectedly, none
   of the reporters tested is stimulated by HBx when integrated into the
   chromosome, despite remaining responsive to their cognate activators.
   Likewise, HBx promotes gene expression from the natural HBV episomal
   template but not from a chromosomally integrated HBV construct. The same
   was observed with the HBx protein of woodchuck HBV. HBx does not affect
   nuclear plasmid copy number and functions independently of CpG
   dinucleotide methylation. Conclusion: We propose that HBx supports HBV
   gene expression by a conserved mechanism that acts specifically on
   episomal DNA templates independently of the nature of the cis-regulatory
   sequences. Because of its uncommon property and key role in viral
   transcription, HBx represents an attractive target for new antiviral
   therapies. (HEPATOLOGY 2012;56:2116-2124)

TI A subcomplex of human mitochondrial RNase P is a bifunctional
   methyltransferase-extensive moonlighting in mitochondrial tRNA
   biogenesis
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) reach their mature functional form through several
   steps of processing and modification. Some nucleotide modifications
   affect the proper folding of tRNAs, and they are crucial in case of the
   non-canonically structured animal mitochondrial tRNAs, as exemplified by
   the apparently ubiquitous methylation of purines at position 9. Here, we
   show that a subcomplex of human mitochondrial RNase P, the endonuclease
   removing tRNA 5' extensions, is the methyltransferase responsible for
   m(1)G9 and m(1)A9 formation. The ability of the mitochondrial
   tRNA:m(1)R9 methyltransferase to modify both purines is uncommon among
   nucleic acid modification enzymes. In contrast to all the related
   methyltransferases, the human mitochondrial enzyme, moreover, requires a
   short-chain dehydrogenase as a partner protein. Human mitochondrial
   RNase P, thus, constitutes a multifunctional complex, whose subunits
   moonlight in cascade: a fatty and amino acid degradation enzyme in tRNA
   methylation and the methyltransferase, in turn, in tRNA 5' end
   processing.

TI Epigenetic Silencing of the Chaperone Cosmc in Human Leukocytes
   Expressing Tn Antigen
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Cosmc is the specific molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum
   for T-synthase, a Golgi beta 3-galactosyltransferase that generates the
   core 1 O-glycan, Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha-Ser/Thr, in glycoproteins.
   Dysfunctional Cosmc results in the formation of inactive T-synthase and
   consequent expression of the Tn antigen (GalNAc alpha 1-Ser/Thr), which
   is associated with several human diseases. However, the molecular
   regulation of expression of Cosmc, which is encoded by a single gene on
   Xq24, is poorly understood. Here we show that epigenetic silencing of
   Cosmc through hypermethylation of its promoter leads to loss of Cosmc
   transcripts in Tn4 cells, an immortalized B cell line from a male
   patient with a Tn-syndrome-like phenotype. These cells lack T-synthase
   activity and express the Tn antigen. Treatment of cells with
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine causes restoration of Cosmc transcripts, restores
   T-synthase activity, and reduces Tn antigen expression. Bisulfite
   sequencing shows that CG dinucleotides in the Cosmc core promoter are
   hypermethylated. Interestingly, several other X-linked genes associated
   with glycosylation are not silenced in Tn4 cells, and we observed no
   correlation of a particular DNA methyltransferase to aberrant
   methylation of Cosmc in these cells. Thus, hypermethylation of the Cosmc
   promoter in Tn4 cells is relatively specific. Epigenetic silencing of
   Cosmc provides another mechanism underlying the abnormal expression of
   the Tn antigen, which may be important in understanding aberrant Tn
   antigen expression in human diseases, including IgA nephropathy and
   cancer.

TI Gene Expression Patterns and Life Cycle Responses of Toxicant-Exposed
   Chironomids
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Cellular stress responses are frequently presumed to be more sensitive
   than traditional ecotoxicological life cycle end points such as survival
   and growth. Yet, the focus to reduce test duration and to generate more
   sensitive end points has caused transcriptomics studies to be performed
   at low doses during short exposures, separately and independently from
   traditional ecotoxicity tests, making comparisons with life cycle end
   points indirect. Therefore we aimed to directly compare the effects on
   growth, survival, and gene expression of the nonbiting midge Chironomus
   riparius. To this purpose, we simultaneously analyzed life cycle and
   transcriptomics responses of chironomid larvae exposed to four model
   toxicants. We observed that already at the lowest test concentrations
   many transcripts were significantly differentially expressed, while the
   life cycle end points of C. riparius were hardly affected. Analysis of
   the differentially expressed transcripts showed that at the lowest test
   concentrations substantial and biologically relevant cellular stress was
   induced and that many transcripts responded already maximally at these
   lowest test concentrations. The direct comparison between molecular end
   life cycle responses after fourteen days of exposure revealed that gene
   expression is more sensitive to toxicant exposure than life cycle end
   points, underlining the potential of transcriptomics for ecotoxicity
   testing and environmental risk assessment.

TI Urinary Iodine is Associated with Insulin Resistance in Subjects with
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES
AB Background: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a major health problem worldwide
   and its prevalence in Saudi Arabia has reached 31.6 %. Patients with
   diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of thyroid disease. The
   purpose of this study was to examine the urinary excretion of iodine in
   type 2 DM (T2DM) patients, and to assess the clinical implication of
   iodine status on T2DM.
   Methods: A total of 266 adult Saudis aged 18-55 years (109 T2DM patients
   and 157 healthy controls) were randomly selected from the Riyadh Cohort
   Study. Subjects were assessed for anthropometry, morning blood
   chemistries including fasting glucose, and lipid profile; serum
   concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, insulin, aPAI, hsCRP,
   Ang II, TNF-alpha, TSH, T3, T4, urine creatinine, urine iodine were
   measured using specific assays.
   Results: The concentration of urine iodine was significantly lower in
   T2DM than in healthy control subjects (84.6 +/- 2.3 vs. 119.4 +/- 3.4, p
   < 0.001), which remained significant after creatinine correction and
   controlling for age (p = 0.01). Furthermore, urinary iodine is
   negatively correlated with waist, hips, SAD, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR
   triglyceride, resistin, angiotensin II (Ang II), and CRP, while it was
   positively associated with TSH.
   Conclusions: The decreased levels of iodine concentration in T2DM
   patients and its likely deleterious effects on metabolic functions calls
   for a systematic approach to thyroid disease screening in diabetic
   patients. Routine annual urinary iodine determination is recommended and
   should target T2DM patients at risk of thyroid dysfunction.

SO METHODS
AB The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of a genome determines the
   spatial localization of regulatory elements and the genes they regulate.
   Thus, elucidating the 3D structure of a genome may result in significant
   insights about how genes are regulated. The current state-of-the art in
   experimental methods, including light microscopy and cell/molecular
   biology, are now able to provide detailed information on the position of
   genes and their interacting partners. However, such methods by
   themselves are not able to determine the high-resolution 3D structure of

TI Epigenetic variation: origin and transgenerational inheritance
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Recent studies have revealed that epigenetic variation in plant
   populations exceeds genetic diversity and that it is influenced by the
   environment. Nevertheless, epigenetic differences are not entirely
   independent of shared ancestry. Epigenetic modifications have gained
   increasing attention, because one can now study their patterns across
   the entire genome and in many different individuals. Not only do
   epigenetic phenomena modulate the activity of the genome in response to
   environmental stimuli, but they also constitute a potential source of
   natural variation. Understanding the emergence and heritability of
   epigenetic variants is critical for understanding how they might become
   subject to natural selection and thus affect genetic diversity. Here we
   review progress in characterizing natural epigenetic variants in model
   and nonmodel plant species and how this work is helping to delineate the
   role of epigenetic changes in evolution.

TI Mercury in tropical and subtropical coastal environments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Anthropogenic activities influence the biogeochemical cycles of mercury,
   both qualitatively and quantitatively, on a global scale from sources to
   sinks. Anthropogenic processes that alter the temporal and spatial
   patterns of sources and cycling processes are changing the impacts of
   mercury contamination on aquatic biota and humans. Human exposure to
   mercury is dominated by the consumption of fish and products from
   aquaculture operations. The risk to society and to ecosystems from
   mercury contamination is growing, and it is important to monitor these
   expanding risks. However, the extent and manner to which anthropogenic
   activities will alter mercury sources and biogeochemical cycling in
   tropical and sub-tropical coastal environments is poorly understood.
   Factors as (1) lack of reliable local/regional data; (2) rapidly
   changing environmental conditions; (3) governmental priorities and; (4)
   technical actions from supra-national institutions, are some of the
   obstacles to overcome in mercury cycling research and policy
   formulation. In the tropics and sub-tropics, research on mercury in the
   environment is moving from an exploratory "inventory" phase towards more
   process-oriented studies. Addressing biodiversity conservation and human
   health issues related to mercury contamination of river basins and

SO STEROIDS
AB Cell cultures of Digitalis species are known to accept exogenous
   substrates for biotransformation reactions. We here report the
   biotransformation of 21-O-acetyl-deoxycorticosterone (1) by cell
   suspension cultures of Digitalis lanata strain W.1.4. Nine derivatives
   of 1 were obtained and their chemical structures determined by
   spectroscopic methods. 2 beta-Hydroxylation and C-21-glucosylation of
   the steroidal nucleus were described for the first time in
   suspension-cultured plant cells. Steroid 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reduction
   products were also observed. Among the compounds isolated and structures
   elucidated were 2 beta,3 beta,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one, 2 beta,3
   alpha,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one and 3 beta,21-dihydroxy-5

TI Successful treatment of thyroid crisis accompanied by hypoglycemia,
   lactic acidosis, and multiple organ failure
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB We describe a case of thyroid crisis with hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis,
   multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation-rare
   but severe complications of thyroid crisis. The patient was a
   59-year-old Chinese woman who presented with evidence of heart failure
   and atrial fibrillation. Analysis of a blood sample yielded astonishing
   results: her blood glucose was 1.7 mmol/L, and lactate greater than 15
   mmol/L with the arterial pH as 6.94. Liver enzymes (alanine
   aminotransferase, 1846 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 6242 U/L) and
   bilirubin elevated rapidly and dramatically. Prompt treatments such as
   mechanical ventilation, plasma exchange, and continuous venovenous
   hemofiltration were preformed, along with antithyroid medication. The
   patient finally survived after 3 weeks of intensive care. We herein
   discuss the possible mechanisms of these metabolic disorders in thyroid
   crisis and possible therapeutic measures that could be used to reduce
   mortality.

TI A Combination of H2A.Z and H4 Acetylation Recruits Brd2 to Chromatin
   during Transcriptional Activation
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB H2A.Z is an essential histone variant that has been implicated to have
   multiple chromosomal functions. To understand how H2A.Z participates in
   such diverse activities, we sought to identify downstream effector
   proteins that are recruited to chromatin via H2A.Z. For this purpose, we
   developed a nucleosome purification method to isolate H2A.Z-containing
   nucleosomes from human cells and used mass spectrometry to identify the
   co-purified nuclear proteins. Through stringent filtering, we identified
   the top 21 candidates, many of which have conserved structural motifs
   that bind post-translationally modified histones. We further validated
   the biological significance of one such candidate, Brd2, which is a
   double-bromodomain-containing protein known to function in
   transcriptional activation. We found that Brd2's preference for H2A.Z
   nucleosomes is mediated through a combination of hyperacetylated H4 on
   these nucleosomes, as well as additional features on H2A.Z itself. In
   addition, comparison of nucleosomes containing either H2A.Z-1 or H2A.Z-2
   isoforms showed that significantly more Brd2 co-purifies with the
   former, suggesting these two isoforms engage different downstream
   effector proteins. Consistent with these biochemical analyses, we found
   that Brd2 is recruited to AR-regulated genes in an H2A.Z-dependent
   manner and that chemical inhibition of Brd2 recruitment greatly inhibits
   AR-regulated gene expression. Taken together, we propose that Brd2 is a
   key downstream mediator that links H2A.Z and transcriptional activation
   of AR-regulated genes. Moreover, this study validates the approach of
   using proteomics to identify nucleosome-interacting proteins in order to
   elucidate downstream mechanistic functions associated with the histone
   variant H2A.Z.

TI A genome-wide 3C-method for characterizing the three-dimensional
   architectures of genomes
SO METHODS
AB Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the three-dimensional (3D)
   organization of chromosomes within the eukaryotic nucleus reflects and
   influences genomic activities, including transcription. DNA replication,
   recombination and DNA repair. In order to uncover structure-function
   relationships, it is necessary first to understand the principles
   underlying the folding and the 3D arrangement of chromosomes. Chromosome
   conformation capture (3C) provides a powerful tool for detecting
   interactions within and between chromosomes. A high throughput
   derivative of 3C, chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C), executes
   a genome-wide interrogation of interaction partners for a given locus.
   We recently developed a new method, a derivative of 3C and 4C, which,
   similar to Hi-C, is capable of comprehensively identifying long-range
   chromosome interactions throughout a genome in an unbiased fashion.
   Hence, our method can be applied to decipher the 3D architectures of
   genomes. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for this method. Published

TI Controls of Nucleosome Positioning in the Human Genome
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement
   on the genome can control which proteins bind to DNA. Currently, few
   human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across
   cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited
   resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of
   micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin (MNase-seq) from seven
   lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion MNase-seq
   fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of
   nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to
   previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent
   positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7%) of
   nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate,
   nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide
   frequency and DNase I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes
   frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We
   estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays
   of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single
   nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce DNase I sensitivity can disrupt the
   phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result
   from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However,
   nucleosome arrays can also be created by DNA sequence alone. The most
   striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12
   that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong
   positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are
   consistently positioned-in some regions because they adopt favored
   sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into
   specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or DNA binding proteins.

TI Transcription Elongation and Tissue-Specific Somatic CAG Instability
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB The expansion of CAG/CTG repeats is responsible for many diseases,
   including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1. CAG/CTG
   expansions are unstable in selective somatic tissues, which accelerates
   disease progression. The mechanisms underlying repeat instability are
   complex, and it remains unclear whether chromatin structure and/or
   transcription contribute to somatic CAG/CTG instability in vivo. To
   address these issues, we investigated the relationship between CAG
   instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus
   using the R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a
   similar transgene, albeit integrated at a different site, and
   recapitulate HD tissue-specific instability. We show that instability
   rates are increased in R6/2 tissues as compared to R6/1 matched-samples.
   High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated
   with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4
   trimethylation at the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9
   dimethylation was reduced in R6/2 tissues relative to R6/1
   matched-tissues. However, the levels of transgene expression and these
   specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two
   tissues showing very different CAG instability levels, irrespective of
   mouse line. Interestingly, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD
   locus, but not the initiating form of RNA Pol II, were tissue-specific
   and correlated with CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K36
   trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was
   specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the
   cerebellum. Together, our data support the view that transcription
   modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo. More specifically, our
   results suggest for the first time that transcription elongation is
   regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective
   CAG instability.

TI Pitx2 Expression Promotes p21 Expression and Cell Cycle Exit in Neural
   Stem Cells
SO CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB Cortical development is a complex process that involves many events
   including proliferation, cell cycle exit and differentiation that need
   to be appropriately synchronized. Neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from
   embryonic cortex are characterized by their ability of self-renewal
   under continued maintenance of multipotency. Cell cycle progression and
   arrest during development is regulated by numerous factors, including
   cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases and their inhibitors. In this study,
   we exogenously expressed the homeodomain transcription factor Pitx2,
   usually expressed in postmitotic progenitors and neurons of the
   embryonic cortex, in NSCs with low expression of endogenous Pitx2. We
   found that Pitx2 expression induced a rapid decrease in proliferation
   associated with an accumulation of NSCs in G1 phase. A search for
   potential cell cycle inhibitors responsible for such cell cycle exit of
   NSCs revealed that Pitx2 expression caused a rapid and dramatic
   (approximate to 20-fold) increase in expression of the cell cycle
   inhibitor p21 (WAF1/Cip1). In addition, Pitx2 bound directly to the p21
   promoter as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in NSCs.
   Surprisingly, Pitx2 expression was not associated with an increase in
   differentiation markers, but instead the expression of nestin,
   associated with undifferentiated NSCs, was maintained. Our results
   suggest that Pitx2 promotes p21 expression and induces cell cycle exit
   in neural progenitors.

TI Transgenerational defense induction and epigenetic inheritance in plants
SO TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB Rapidly accumulating evidence shows that herbivore and pathogen attack
   of plants can generate particular defense phenotypes across generations.
   What was once thought to be an oddity of plant defense induction now
   appears to be a taxonomically widespread phenomenon with strong
   potential to impact the ecology and evolution of species interactions.
   DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small RNAs each contribute
   to transgenerational defense initiation; examples in several species
   demonstrate that this induction can last for multiple generations.
   Priming of the offspring generation for more rapid induction following
   subsequent attack has also been reported. The extent to which
   transgenerational induction is predictable, detectable in nature, and
   subject to manipulation will determine the ability of researchers to
   decipher its role in plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions.

   accumulation of an amorphous proteinaceous material in various organs
   and tissues of the body. Amyloid goiter is an exceedingly rare
   pathologic condition due to massive amyloid infiltration of the thyroid
   tissue. Amyloid goiter occurs in association with both primary and
   secondary systemic amyloidosis, more commonly in the latter.
   Preoperatively, it simulates a multinodular goiter, and surgical
   intervention is often necessary to establish a diagnosis and to relieve
   compressive symptoms of a neck mass. We present the case of an

TI Regulation of mGluR1 expression in human melanocytes and melanoma cells
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB We demonstrated that ectopic expression of metabotropic glutamate
   receptor 1 (mGluR1/Grm1) in mouse melanocytes was sufficient to induce
   melanoma development in vivo with 100% penetrance. We also showed that
   about 60% of human melanoma biopsies and cell lines, but not benign nevi
   or normal human melanocytes expressed mGluR1, suggesting that GRM1 may
   be involved in melanomagenesis. mGluR1 is expressed primarily in
   neurons. In various non-neuronal cells, mGluR1 expression is regulated
   via binding of Neuron-Restrictive-Silencer-Factor (NRSF) to a
   Neuron-Restrictive-Silencer-Element (NRSE). Here, we report on the
   possibility that aberrant mGluR1 expression in melanoma is due to
   alterations in NRSF and/or NRSE. We show that in human melanocytes,
   binding of NRSF to NRSE in the GRM1 promoter region is necessary for the
   suppression of mGluR1 expression. We also show that inhibiting the
   expression of the transcription factor Sp1 or interference with its
   ability to bind DNA can result in increased mGluR1 expression perhaps
   via its function as a negative regulator. In addition, we also provide
   evidence that demethylation within the promoter region of GRM1 may also
   be a mechanism for the derepression of mGluR1 expression in melanocytes
   that progress to cell transformation and tumor formation. (C) 2012

TI Decrease of p400 ATPase complex and loss of H2A.Z within the p21
   promoter occur in senescent IMR-90 human fibroblasts
SO MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Replicative senescence in human diploid fibroblasts is characterised by
   an exhaustion of proliferative potential and permanent cell cycle
   arrest. During senescence, telomere shortening-generated DNA damage
   activates p53 pathway that upregulates cell cycle inhibitors, such as
   p21. Human p400 ATPase is a chromatin remodeller that plays a key role
   in the deposition of the histone variant, H2A.Z within the p21 promoter,
   repressing p21 gene expression. Decline of p400 ATPase in senescent
   IMR-90 cells prompted us to investigate structural changes in the
   chromatin of the p21 promoter during in vitro aging. Whereas doxorubicin
   treatment in early-passaged cells results in nucleosome density changes
   near the p53 binding sites of the p21 promoter, our studies show that
   senescent cells with a high p21 transcription activity had a comparable
   nucleosome distribution as unstressed young cells. However, H2A.Z that
   is highly enriched within the p21 promoter of young cells is depleted in
   senescent cells, suggesting that downregulation of p400 and loss of
   H2A.Z localisation play roles in relieving p21 gene repression in
   senescent IMR-90 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that
   age-dependent p400 downregulation and loss of H2A.Z localisation may
   contribute to the onset of replicative senescence through a sustained
   high rate of p21 transcription. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

TI Mercury biogeochemical cycling in the ocean and policy implications
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Anthropogenic activities have enriched mercury in the biosphere by at
   least a factor of three, leading to increases in total mercury (Hg) in
   the surface ocean. However, the impacts on ocean fish and associated
   trends in human exposure as a result of such changes are less clear.
   Here we review our understanding of global mass budgets for both
   inorganic and methylated Hg species in ocean seawater. We consider
   external inputs from atmospheric deposition and rivers as well as
   internal production of monomethylmercury (CH(3)Hg) and dimethylmercury
   ((CH(3))(2)Hg). Impacts of large-scale ocean circulation and vertical
   transport processes on Hg distribution throughout the water column and
   how this influences bioaccumulation into ocean food chains are also
   discussed. Our analysis suggests that while atmospheric deposition is
   the main source of inorganic Hg to open ocean systems, most of the CH3Hg
   accumulating in ocean fish is derived from in situ production within the
   upper waters (< 1000 m). An analysis of the available data suggests that
   concentrations in the various ocean basins are changing at different
   rates due to differences in atmospheric loading and that the deeper
   waters of the oceans are responding slowly to changes in atmospheric Hg
   inputs. Most biological exposures occur in the upper ocean and therefore
   should respond over years to decades to changes in atmospheric mercury
   inputs achieved by regulatory control strategies. Migratory pelagic fish
   such as tuna and swordfish are an important component of CH(3)Hg
   exposure for many human populations and therefore any reduction in
   anthropogenic releases of Hg and associated deposition to the ocean will
   result in a decline in human exposure and risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

SO EXPERT REVIEW OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB Expert Rev. Mol Diagn. 12(8), 871-878 (2012) Bladder cancer is a
   heterogeneous disease, both clinically and pathologically. Its detection
   is still based on methods with low sensitivity and although standard

   Recently, epigenetic-based biomarkers have brought to light new insights
   into the clinical management of bladder cancer. A large number of these
   markers arose in an attempt to better understand the molecular
   mechanisms involved in bladder carcinogenesis and tumor progression and
   how these may translate into diagnostic or prognostic tools. The time
   has come to turn these findings into clinically meaningful biomarkers,

TI What's causing this epidemic of thyroid disease and can we prevent it?
SO JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB Practical relevance: Since first being reported in the late 1970s, there
   has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of hyperthyroidism in
   cats. It is now recognized worldwide as the most common feline endocrine
   disorder.
   Patient group: Hyperthyroidism is an important cause of morbidity in
   cats older than 10 years of age. It is estimated that over 10% of all
   senior cats will develop the disorder.
   Clinical challenges: Despite its frequency, the underlying cause(s) of
   this common disease is/are not known, and no one has suggested a means
   to prevent the disorder. Because of the multiple risk factors that have
   been described for feline hyperthyroidism, it is likely that more than
   one factor is involved in its pathogenesis. Continuous, lifelong
   exposure to environmental thyroid disruptor chemicals or goitrogens in
   food or water, acting together in an additive or synergistic manner, may
   first lead to euthyroid goiter and then to autonomous adenomatous
   hyperplasia, thyroid adenoma and hyperthyroidism.
   Evidence base: This review draws on published research studies to
   summarize the available evidence about the risk factors for feline
   hyperthyroidism. Based on the known goitrogens that may be present in
   the cat's food, drinking water or environment, it proposes measures that
   cat owners can implement that might prevent, or reduce the prevalence
   of, thyroid tumors and hyperthyroidism in their cats.

TI 5 alpha-REDUCTASES IN HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY: AN UNFOLDING STORY
SO ENDOCRINE PRACTICE
AB Objective: 5 alpha-reductases are a family of isozymes expressed in a
   wide host of tissues including the central nervous system (CNS) and play
   a pivotal role in male sexual differentiation, development and
   physiology.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search from 1970 to 2011 was made
   through PubMed and the relevant information was summarized.
   Results: 5 alpha reductases convert testosterone, progesterone,
   deoxycorticosterone, aldosterone and corticosterone into their
   respective 5 alpha-dihydro-derivatives, which serve as substrates for 3
   alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. The latter transforms these
   5 alpha-reduced metabolites into a subclass of neuroactive steroid
   hormones with distinct physiological functions. The neuroactive steroid
   hormones modulate. a multitude of functions in human physiology
   encompassing regulation of sexual differentiation, neuroprotection,
   memory enhancement, anxiety, sleep and stress, among others. In
   addition, 5 alpha-reductase type 3 is also implicated in the
   N-glycosylation of proteins via formation of dolichol phosphate. The
   family of 5 alpha-reductases was targeted for drug development to treat
   pathophysiological conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and
   androgenetic alopecia. While the clinical use of 5 alpha-reductase
   inhibitors was well established,. the scope and the magnitude of the
   adverse side effects of such drugs, especially on the CNS, is still
   unrecognized due to lack of knowledge of the various physiological
   functions of this family of enzymes, especially in the CNS.
   Conclusion: There is an urgent need to better understand the function of
   5 alpha-reductases and the role of neuroactive steroids in human
   physiology in order to minimize the potential adverse side effects of
   inhibitors targeting 5a-reductases to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia
   and androgenic alopecia. (Endocr Pract. 2012;18:965-975)

TI The death and burial of sunghir 1
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY
AB The Mid Upper Paleolithic Sunghir 1 burial of an older adult male is one
   of the most elaborate burials known, with red ochre, thousands of
   mammoth ivory beads, and other body ornaments. Reanalysis and cleaning
   of the skeletal remains revealed a perimortem incision in the
   ventrallateral first thoracic vertebra (T1) body, most likely from a
   sharp blade or point and the probable cause of death. Context indicates
   that the trauma was most likely from a hunting accident or social
   altercation. The unusual cause of death may be correlated with the
   exceptional burial elaboration of Sunghir 1, adding to the high
   frequency of unusual individuals in the red ochre burials of the Mid
   Upper Paleolithic. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Bromodomain Protein Brd4 Plays a Key Role in Merkel Cell Polyomavirus
   DNA Replication
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV) is the first human polyomavirus
   to be definitively linked to cancer. The mechanisms of MCV-induced
   oncogenesis and much of MCV biology are largely unexplored. In this
   study, we demonstrate that bromodomain protein 4 (Brd4) interacts with
   MCV large T antigen (LT) and plays a critical role in viral DNA
   replication. Brd4 knockdown inhibits MCV replication, which can be
   rescued by recombinant Brd4. Brd4 colocalizes with the MCV
   LT/replication origin complex in the nucleus and recruits replication
   factor C (RFC) to the viral replication sites. A dominant negative
   inhibitor of the Brd4-MCV LT interaction can dissociate Brd4 and RFC
   from the viral replication complex and abrogate MCV replication.
   Furthermore, obstructing the physiologic interaction between Brd4 and
   host chromatin with the chemical compound JQ1(+) leads to enhanced MCV
   DNA replication, demonstrating that the role of Brd4 in MCV replication
   is distinct from its role in chromatin-associated transcriptional
   regulation. Our findings demonstrate mechanistic details of the MCV
   replication machinery; providing novel insight to elucidate the life
   cycle of this newly discovered oncogenic DNA virus.

TI Mechanism of intestinal folate transport during folate deficiency in
   rodent model
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB Background & objectives: Folate deficiency is a public health problem
   and is the most notable for its association with neural tube defect in
   developing embryo, megaloblastic anaemia, cancers and cardiovascular
   diseases. The mechanisms of the intestinal folate uptake process have
   been earlier characterized. However, much less is known about
   regulation. In this study we evaluated the mechanistic insights of
   folate absorption in an in vivo model of folate deficiency.
   Methods: Male Wistar rats were fed folate-containing diet (2 mg/kg folic
   acid) or a folic acid-free diet over 3 months and folate transport was
   studied in intestinal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV).
   Results: The characterization of the folate transport system in
   intestinal brush border membrane (BBM) suggested it to be a carrier
   mediated, acidic pH stimulated, and Na(+) independent. Folate deficiency
   increased the folate transport by altering the Vmax without changing the
   K(m) of folate transport process. The increased transport efficiency of
   the BBM was associated with upregulation of folate transporters at both
   mRNA and protein level.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Folate deficiency resulted in significant
   upregulation of intestinal folate uptake, by increasing number of
   transporters without any change in specificity of transporters towards
   its substrate. The observed upregulation was associated with significant
   increase in reduced folate carrier (RFC) and proton coupled folate
   transporter (PCFT) expressions, suggesting the transcriptional and
   translational regulation of folate uptake during folate deficiency.

TI A model for homeopathic remedy effects: low dose nanoparticles,
   allostatic cross-adaptation, and time-dependent sensitization in a
   complex adaptive system
SO BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB Background: This paper proposes a novel model for homeopathic remedy
   action on living systems. Research indicates that homeopathic remedies
   (a) contain measurable source and silica nanoparticles heterogeneously
   dispersed in colloidal solution; (b) act by modulating biological
   function of the allostatic stress response network (c) evoke biphasic
   actions on living systems via organism-dependent adaptive and
   endogenously amplified effects; (d) improve systemic resilience.
   Discussion: The proposed active components of homeopathic remedies are
   nanoparticles of source substance in water-based colloidal solution, not
   bulk-form drugs. Nanoparticles have unique biological and
   physico-chemical properties, including increased catalytic reactivity,
   protein and DNA adsorption, bioavailability, dose-sparing,
   electromagnetic, and quantum effects different from bulk-form materials.
   Trituration and/or liquid succussions during classical remedy
   preparation create "top-down" nanostructures. Plants can biosynthesize
   remedy-templated silica nanostructures. Nanoparticles stimulate
   hormesis, a beneficial low-dose adaptive response. Homeopathic remedies
   prescribed in low doses spaced intermittently over time act as
   biological signals that stimulate the organism's allostatic biological
   stress response network, evoking nonlinear modulatory, self-organizing
   change. Potential mechanisms include time-dependent sensitization (TDS),
   a type of adaptive plasticity/metaplasticity involving progressive
   amplification of host responses, which reverse direction and oscillate
   at physiological limits. To mobilize hormesis and TDS, the remedy must
   be appraised as a salient, but low level, novel threat, stressor, or
   homeostatic disruption for the whole organism. Silica nanoparticles
   adsorb remedy source and amplify effects. Properly-timed remedy dosing
   elicits disease-primed compensatory reversal in direction of maladaptive
   dynamics of the allostatic network, thus promoting resilience and
   recovery from disease.
   Summary: Homeopathic remedies are proposed as source nanoparticles that
   mobilize hormesis and time-dependent sensitization via
   non-pharmacological effects on specific biological adaptive and
   amplification mechanisms. The nanoparticle nature of remedies would
   distinguish them from conventional bulk drugs in structure, morphology,
   and functional properties. Outcomes would depend upon the ability of the
   organism to respond to the remedy as a novel stressor or heterotypic
   biological threat, initiating reversals of cumulative, cross-adapted
   biological maladaptations underlying disease in the allostatic stress
   response network. Systemic resilience would improve. This model provides
   a foundation for theory-driven research on the role of nanomaterials in
   living systems, mechanisms of homeopathic remedy actions and
   translational uses in nanomedicine.

TI Increased nociceptive sensitivity and nociceptin/orphanin FQ levels in a
   rat model of PTSD
SO MOLECULAR PAIN
AB Background: Clinical studies indicate that post-traumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) frequently shares co-morbidity with chronic pain.
   Although in animals acute stress-induced antinociception is well
   documented, the effect of PTSD-like stress on nociceptive sensitivity is
   unclear. Though a few studies measured nociceptive responses at a single
   time point, no studies have examined changes in nociceptive sensitivity
   over time following exposure to PTSD-like stress. Nociceptin/orphanin FQ
   (N/OFQ), an endogenous ligand for the N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor,
   modulates various biological functions in the central nervous system
   that are affected by PTSD, including nociceptive sensitivity, stress and
   anxiety, learning and memory.
   Results: The present study examined thermal and mechanical nociceptive
   sensitivity in male Sprague Dawley rats between 7 and 28 days after
   single-prolonged stress (SPS), an established animal model for PTSD. Rat
   paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to von Frey and paw withdrawal latencies
   (PWL) to radiant heat stimuli, respectively, dramatically decreased as
   early as 7 days after initiation of SPS and lasted the length of the
   study, 28 days. In addition, N/OFQ levels increased in cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF; on days 9, 14 and 28) and serum (day 28), while levels of
   circulating corticosterone (CORT) decreased 28 days after initiation of
   SPS. SPS exposure induced anxiety-like behavior and enhanced inhibition
   of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as previously reported
   for this model.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that SPS induces the development of
   persistent mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia that is
   accompanied by increased N/OFQ content in the CSF, and eventually, in
   serum. These findings suggest a link between N/OFQ and the development
   of hyperalgesia and allodynia in a rat model of PTSD.

TI Greater insulin sensitivity in calorie restricted rats occurs with
   unaltered circulating levels of several important myokines and cytokines
SO NUTRITION & METABOLISM
AB Calorie restriction (CR; similar to 60% of ad libitum, AL intake) has
   been associated with substantial alterations in body composition and
   insulin sensitivity. Recently, several proteins that are secreted by
   nontraditional endocrine tissues, including skeletal muscle and other
   tissues, have been discovered to modulate energy metabolism, body
   composition, and insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to
   characterize the influence of CR by rats on plasma levels of six of
   these newly recognized metabolic hormones (BDNF, FGF21, IL-1 beta,
   myonectin, myostatin, and irisin). Body composition of 9-month old male
   Fischer-344/Brown Norway rats (AL and CR groups) was determined by
   nuclear magnetic resonance. Blood sampled from the carotid artery of
   unanesthetized rats was used to measure concentrations of glucose and
   plasma proteins. As expected, CR versus AL rats had significantly
   altered body composition (reduced percent fat mass, increased percent
   lean mass) and significantly improved insulin sensitivity (based on the
   homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance index). Also
   consistent with previous reports, CR compared to AL rats had
   significantly greater plasma levels of adiponectin and corticosterone.
   However, there were no significant diet-related differences in plasma
   levels of BDNF, FGF21, IL-1 beta, myonectin, myostatin, or irisin. In
   conclusion, these results indicate that alterations in plasma
   concentration of these six secreted proteins are not essential for the
   CR-related improvement in insulin sensitivity in rats.

TI Metabolic consequences of chronic sleep restriction in rats: Changes in
   body weight regulation and energy expenditure
SO PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
AB Epidemiological studies have shown an association between short or
   disrupted sleep and an increased risk to develop obesity. In animal
   studies, however, sleep restriction leads to an attenuation of weight
   gain that cannot be explained by changes in energy intake. In the
   present study, we assessed whether the attenuated weight gain under
   conditions of restricted sleep is a consequence of an overall increase
   in energy expenditure. Adult male rats were subjected to a schedule of
   chronic sleep restriction (SR) for 8 days with a 4 h window of
   unrestricted rest per day. Electroencephalogram and electromyogram
   recordings were performed to quantify the effect of the sleep
   restriction schedule on sleep-wake patterns. In a separate experiment,
   we measured sleep restriction-induced changes in body weight, food
   intake, and regulatory hormones such as glucose, insulin, leptin and
   corticosterone. To investigate whether a change in energy expenditure
   underlies the attenuation of weight gain, energy expenditure was
   measured by the doubly labeled water method from day 5 until day 8 of
   the SR protocol. Results show a clear attenuation of weight gain during
   sleep restriction but no change in food intake. Baseline plasma glucose,
   insulin and leptin levels are decreased after sleep restriction which
   presumably reflects the nutritional status of the rats. The daily energy
   expenditure during SR was significantly increased compared to control
   rats. Together, we conclude that the attenuation of body weight gain in
   sleep restricted rats is explained by an overall increase in energy
   expenditure together with an unaltered energy intake. Published by

TI A cell-free system for functional centromere and kinetochore assembly
SO NATURE PROTOCOLS
AB This protocol describes a cell-free system for studying vertebrate
   centromere and kinetochore formation. We reconstitute tandem arrays of
   centromere protein A (CENP-A) nucleosomes as a substrate for centromere
   and kinetochore assembly. These chromatin substrates are immobilized on
   magnetic beads and then incubated in Xenopus egg extracts that provide a
   source for centromere and kinetochore proteins and that can be cycled
   between mitotic and interphase cell cycle states. This cell-free system
   lends itself to use in protein immunodepletion, complementation and drug
   inhibition as a tool to perturb centromere and kinetochore assembly,
   cytoskeletal dynamics, DNA modification and protein post-translational
   modification. This system provides a distinct advantage over cell-based
   investigations in which perturbing centromere and kinetochore function
   often results in lethality. After incubation in egg extract,
   reconstituted CENP-A chromatin specifically assembles centromere and
   kinetochore proteins, which locally stabilize microtubules and, on
   microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole, activate the mitotic
   checkpoint. A typical experiment takes 3 d.

TI Efficacy of Fibrin Sealant for Drainage Reduction in Total Thyroidectomy
   with Bilateral Central Neck Dissection
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB Objective. To investigate the efficacy of fibrin sealant (FS) for
   reducing postoperative drainage in patients who underwent total
   thyroidectomy (TT) with bilateral central neck dissection (CND) for
   papillary thyroid cancer.
   Study Design. Prospective randomized trial.
   Setting. Tertiary care institution.
   Subjects and Methods. Seventy-eight patients with papillary thyroid
   cancer were enrolled and randomized to either the FS application group
   (FS+, 38 patients) or no FS application group (FS-, 40 patients). In
   both groups, postoperative drainage amounts were measured by a negative
   suction system until the criterion of drain removal was met. Drainage
   amounts as well as the time to drain removal, postoperative
   complications, and chemical profile assay of drain fluids between the 2
   groups were performed.
   Results. Drainage amounts at the initial 24 hours as well as total
   amounts of the FS+ group tended to be lower than those of the FS- group;
   however, they were not statistically different (at initial 24 hours,
   64.3 +/- 17.5 mL vs 73.0 +/- 18.0 mL, P = .06; total amounts, 93.5 +/-
   30.7 mL vs 105.7 +/- 31.2 mL, P = .05). The FS application did not
   shorten the time to drain removal even when different criteria for drain
   removal were applied (criteria of <20 mL/d or <30 mL/d). When chemistry
   profiles of collected drain fluids were analyzed in patient subgroups,
   the level of triglycerides in the FS+ group was significantly lower than
   in the FS- group.
   Conclusion. Fibrin sealant has no additional advantage in terms of
   drainage reduction and early discharge despite the additional medical
   cost.

TI The Armadillo Repeat Gene ZAK IXIK Promotes Arabidopsis Early Embryo and
   Endosperm Development through a Distinctive Gametophytic Maternal Effect
SO PLANT CELL
AB The proper balance of parental genomic contributions to the fertilized
   embryo and endosperm is essential for their normal growth and
   development. The characterization of many gametophytic maternal effect
   (GME) mutants affecting seed development indicates that there are
   certain classes of genes with a predominant maternal contribution. We
   present a detailed analysis of the GME mutant zak ixik (zix), which
   displays delayed and arrested growth at the earliest stages of embryo
   and endosperm development. ZIX encodes an Armadillo repeat (Arm) protein
   highly conserved across eukaryotes. Expression studies revealed that ZIX
   manifests a GME through preferential maternal expression in the early
   embryo and endosperm. This parent-of-origin-dependent expression is
   regulated by neither the histone and DNA methylation nor the DNA
   demethylation pathways known to regulate some other GME mutants. The ZIX
   protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells in
   reproductive tissues and actively dividing root zones. The maternal ZIX
   allele is required for the maternal expression of MINISEED3.
   Collectively, our results reveal a reproductive function of plant Arm
   proteins in promoting early seed growth, which is achieved through a
   distinct GME of ZIX that involves mechanisms for maternal
   allele-specific expression that are independent of the well-established
   pathways.

SO TOPIA-CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
AB This article surveys the recent transformation of Simon Fraser
   University (SFU) against the backdrop of the crisis of Canadian public
   post-secondary education. The article contends that the Canadian model
   for the public funding of mass higher education that became consolidated
   in the postwar years is coming to an end, and that the metamorphosis of
   SFU over recent decades illuminates some of the tensions, tendencies and
   conflicts within what the Edu-factory Collective (2010) has called a
   "double crisis": that of the university on the one hand, and of the
   global financial system on the other. Three processes in particular are
   at the heart of this transformation: a) the increasing importance of
   private capital, management and branding of the university in an era Of
   decreased public funding; b) the university's expansion across the urban
   fabric, in a process that brings displacement and gentrification; and c)
   the emergence of hybrid public-private models of educational delivery
   that cater to global markets for tuition dollars. Within this
   transformation, the article also points to lines of tension that are
   emerging out of these processes; creating conflicts and moments of
   encounter between the labour organizations, student groups and
   anti-gentrification activists struggling against the what Andrew Ross
   (2009) has called the "global university."

TI Inflammation-Associated Cancer Development in Digestive Organs:
   Mechanisms and Roles for Genetic and Epigenetic Modulation
SO GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Chronic inflammation, regardless of infectious agents, plays important
   roles in the development of various cancers, particularly in digestive
   organs, including Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer,
   hepatitis C virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma, and
   colitis-associated colon cancers. Cancer development is characterized by
   stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations of various
   proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. During chronic inflammation,
   infectious agents such as H pylori and hepatitis C virus as well as
   intrinsic mediators of inflammatory responses, including proinflammatory
   cytokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, can induce genetic
   and epigenetic changes, including point mutations, deletions,
   duplications, recombinations, and methylation of various tumor-related
   genes through various mechanisms. Furthermore, inflammation also
   modulates the expressions of microRNAs that influence the production of
   several tumor-related messenger RNAs or proteins. These molecular events
   induced by chronic inflammation work in concert to alter important
   pathways involved in normal cellular function, and hence accelerate
   inflammation-associated cancer development. Among these, recent studies
   highlighted an important role of activation-induced cytidine deaminase,
   a nucleotide-editing enzyme essential for somatic hypermutation and
   class-switch recombination of the immunoglobulin gene, as a genomic
   modulator in inflammation-associated cancer development.

TI Castration Eliminates Conspecific Aggression in Group-Housed CD1 Male
   Surveillance Mice (Mus muscuius)
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB Microbiologic surveillance is essential for murine health maintenance.
   At our institution, female progeny of inhouse-bred CD1 mice are used in
   both the transgenic facility and health-surveillance program. To reduce
   overall animal use, the male progeny, otherwise slated for euthanasia
   due to a lack of utility, also were enrolled as sentinels. However,
   veterinary technicians noted excessive fighting among cohoused male
   surveillance mice that was not resolved by environmental enrichment.
   After review of factors known to influence aggression in male mice,
   early castration was selected as the most likely approach to eliminate
   aggressive behavior among cohoused male mice. Male mice were castrated
   before 1 mo of age and then placed into the surveillance program. Each
   week, veterinary technicians recorded all incidences of fighting in
   cages of castrated and noncastrated male surveillance mice to determine
   differences between groups. Over a 3-mo period, the overall prevalence
   of fighting in cages of intact male mice was 64% (14 of 22 cages);
   although all intact male mice were used preferentially for complete
   necropsy surveillance time points, one of these cages required
   separation and 4 cages housed mice that incurred severe fight wounds
   requiring both separation and euthanasia. In comparison, a 0% (0 of 16
   cages) prevalence of fighting was observed among castrated male mice.
   Castration eradicated pain and distress associated with fighting,
   thereby constituting a refinement, and allowed the use of male mice from
   the breeding colony for surveillance, thereby reducing the total number
   of mice bred for surveillance. In conclusion, castration is a minimally
   invasive, safe, humane, rapid method to eliminate conspecific aggression
   among male CD1 surveillance mice.

   weeks after each thyroid disorder induction. We measured the renal
   response to functional blockade of the tubular sodium transporters,
   using acetazolamide to inhibit the activity of NHE3, furosemide for
   NKCC2, hydrochlorotiazide for NCC, and amiloride for ENaC. Expression of
   sodium transporters was analyzed by measuring the protein abundance by
   Western blot. The responsiveness to NHE3 inhibition and NHE3 protein was
   lower in hypothyroid rats and higher in hyperthyroid rats vs controls.
   Hypothyroid rats showed greater diuretic and natriuretic responses to
   NKCC2 and ENaC blockade and higher protein abundance of NKCC2 vs
   controls. Hyperthyroid rats showed greater protein expression of NKCC2
   and NCC vs controls. Groups did not differ in responsiveness to NCC
   blockade. The expression and activity of ENaC were lower in hyperthyroid
   rats. In conclusion, reduced NHE3 activity may participate in the low
   blood pressure of hypothyroid rats and elevated NHE3 activity in the
   high blood pressure of hyperthyroid rats. These proximal alterations are
   counter-balanced by functional upregulation of NKCC2 and ENaC in
   downstream nephron segments of hypothyroid rats and by downregulation of
   alpha ENaC activity and expression in hyperthyroid rats. (J. Endocrinol.

TI Unique Pattern of ORC2 and MCM7 Localization During DNA Replication
   Licensing in the Mouse Zygote
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB In eukaryotes, DNA synthesis is preceded by licensing of replication
   origins. We examined the subcellular localization of two licensing
   proteins, ORC2 and MCM7, in the mouse zygotes and two-cell embryos. In
   somatic cells ORC2 remains bound to DNA replication origins throughout
   the cell cycle, while MCM7 is one of the last proteins to bind to the
   licensing complex. We found that MCM7 but not ORC2 was bound to DNA in
   metaphase II oocytes and remained associated with the DNA until S-phase.
   Shortly after fertilization, ORC2 was detectable at the metaphase II
   spindle poles and then between the separating chromosomes. Neither
   protein was present in the sperm cell at fertilization. As the sperm
   head decondensed, MCM7 was bound to DNA, but no ORC2 was seen. By 4 h
   after fertilization, both pronuclei contained DNA bound ORC2 and MCM7.
   As expected, during S-phase of the first zygotic cell cycle, MCM7 was
   released from the DNA, but ORC2 remained bound. During zygotic mitosis,
   ORC2 again localized first to the spindle poles, then to the area
   between the separating chromosomes. ORC2 then formed a ring around the
   developing two-cell nuclei before entering the nucleus. Only soluble
   MCM7 was present in the G2 pronuclei, but by zygotic metaphase it was
   bound to DNA, again apparently before ORC2. In G1 of the two-cell stage,
   both nuclei had salt-resistant ORC2 and MCM7. These data suggest that
   licensing follows a unique pattern in the early zygote that differs from
   what has been described for other mammalian cells that have been
   studied.

TI Thyroid hormones are involved in 5 '-nucleotidase modulation in soluble
   fraction of cardiac tissue
SO LIFE SCIENCES
AB Aims: To investigate the role of TH (thyroid hormones) in
   5'-nucleotidase activity and expression in cardiac soluble fraction
   (SF).
   Main methods: Male Wistar rats received daily injections of 14 (10, 25
   or 50 mu g T4/100 g body weight) for 14 days to develop a
   hyperthyroidism condition. Thyroidectomy was performed in other animals
   to mimic hypothyroidism, and 14 days after surgery they were submitted
   to TH replacement therapy.
   Key findings: T4 reduced the 5'-nucleotidase activity (T4-25. P<0.05 and
   14-50, P<0.01) in the SF. Conversely, hypothyroidism significantly
   increased the 5'-nucleotidase activity in this fraction (P<0.001) and TH
   replacement therapy reversed the latter result (P<0.001 compared to
   hypothyroid group). The analysis of protein expression in the SF showed
   that 5'-nucleotidase was more expressed in hypothyroid than in the
   control group and that the phosphorylated state of PKC observed in this
   condition may contribute to a possible mechanism of 5'-nucleotidase
   modulation by thyroid status.
   Significance: Taken together, these data reveal that TH can influence
   adenosine production by modulating 5'-nucleotidase activity and
   expression, which may contribute to the cardioprotective effect and the
   maintenance of cardiac function under TH privation. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Genetic, environmental and stochastic factors in monozygotic twin
   discordance with a focus on epigenetic differences
SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Genetic-epidemiological studies on monozygotic (MZ) twins have been used
   for decades to tease out the relative contributions of genes and the
   environment to a trait. Phenotypic discordance in MZ twins has
   traditionally been ascribed to non-shared environmental factors acting
   after birth, however recent data indicate that this explanation is far
   too simple. In this paper, we review other reasons for discordance,
   including differences in the in utero environment, genetic mosaicism,
   and stochastic factors, focusing particularly on epigenetic discordance.
   Epigenetic differences are gaining increasing recognition. Although it
   is clear that in specific cases epigenetic alterations provide a causal
   factor in disease etiology, the overall significance of epigenetics in
   twin discordance remains unclear. It is also challenging to determine
   the causality and relative contributions of environmental, genetic, and
   stochastic factors to epigenetic variability. Epigenomic profiling
   studies have recently shed more light on the dynamics of temporal
   methylation change and methylome heritability, yet have not given a
   definite answer regarding their relevance to disease, because of
   limitations in establishing causality. Here, we explore the subject of
   epigenetics as another component in human phenotypic variability and its
   links to disease focusing particularly on evidence from MZ twin studies.

TI H4K16 acetylation affects recombination and ncRNA transcription at rDNA
   in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB Transcription-associated recombination is an important process involved
   in several aspects of cell physiology. In the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNA polymerase II transcription-dependent
   recombination has been demonstrated among the repeated units. In this
   study, we investigate the mechanisms controlling this process at the
   chromatin level. On the basis of a small biased screening, we found that
   mutants of histone deacetylases and chromatin architectural proteins
   alter both the amount of Pol II-dependent noncoding transcripts and
   recombination products at rDNA in a coordinated manner. Of interest,
   chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses in these mutants revealed a
   corresponding variation of the histone H4 acetylation along the rDNA
   repeat, particularly at Lys-16. Here we provide evidence that a single,
   rapid, and reversible posttranslational modification-the acetylation of
   the H4K16 residue-is involved in the coordination of transcription and
   recombination at rDNA.

TI TFIIIC localizes budding yeast ETC sites to the nuclear periphery
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB Chromatin function requires specific three-dimensional architectures of
   chromosomes. We investigated whether Saccharomyces cerevisiae extra
   TFIIIC (ETC) sites, which bind the TFIIIC transcription factor but do
   not recruit RNA polymerase III, show specific intranuclear positioning.
   We show that six of the eight known S. cerevisiae ETC sites localize
   predominantly at the nuclear periphery, and that ETC sites retain their
   tethering function when moved to a new chromosomal location. Several
   lines of evidence indicate that TFIIIC is central to the ETC peripheral
   localization mechanism. Mutating or deleting the TFIIIC-binding
   consensus ablated ETC -site peripheral positioning, and inducing
   degradation of the TFIIIC subunit Tfc3 led to rapid release of an ETC
   site from the nuclear periphery. We find, moreover, that anchoring one
   TFIIIC subunit at an ectopic chromosomal site causes recruitment of
   others and drives peripheral tethering. Localization of ETC sites at the
   nuclear periphery also requires Mps3, a Sad1-UNC-84-domain protein that
   spans the inner nuclear membrane. Surprisingly, we find that the
   chromatin barrier and insulator functions of an ETC site do not depend
   on correct peripheral localization. In summary, TFIIIC and Mps3 together
   direct the intranuclear positioning of a new class of S. cerevisiae
   genomic loci positioned at the nuclear periphery.

TI Evaluation of expression and function of vascular endothelial growth
   factor receptor 2, platelet derived growth factor receptors-alpha and
   -beta, KIT, and RET in canine apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma and
   thyroid carcinoma
SO BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Background: Toceranib phosphate (Palladia) has a reported objective
   response rate of 25% in both canine apocrine gland anal sac
   adenocarcinoma (AGASACA) and thyroid carcinoma (TC), with stable disease
   occurring in an additional 50-60% of dogs. The basis for the observed
   responses to toceranib is not known. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate AGASACA and TC samples for the expression and activation of
   VEGFR2, PDGFR alpha, PDGFR beta, KIT and RET to assess whether
   dysregulation of these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) may contribute
   to the biologic activity of toceranib.
   Results: mRNA for VEGFR2, PDGFR alpha/beta, KIT and RET was detected in
   all AGASACA samples. mRNA for VEGFR2, PDGFR alpha/beta, and KIT was
   detected in all TC samples, while mRNA for RET was amplified in 10/15
   samples. No phosphorylation of VEGFR2, PDGFR alpha/beta, or KIT was
   observed on the arrays. However, phosphorylation of RET was detected in
   54% of the primary AGASACA and 20% of TC. VEGFR2 was expressed in 19/24
   primary and 6/10 metastatic AGASACA and 6/15 TC samples. KIT was present
   in 8/24 primary and 3/10 metastatic AGASACA and 9/15 TC samples. PDGFR
   alpha expression was noted in all tumor samples. In contrast PDGFR beta
   expression was found in only a few tumor samples but was evident in the
   stroma of all tumor specimens.
   Conclusions: Known targets of toceranib are expressed in both AGASAC and
   TC. Given the observed expression of VEGFR and PDGFR alpha/beta and
   phosphorylation of RET, these RTKs merit investigation as to their roles
   in the biology of AGSACA and TC and their contribution to toceranib's
   activity.

TI A putative functional role for oligodendrocytes in mood regulation
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Altered glial structure and function is implicated in several major
   mental illnesses and increasing evidence specifically links changes in
   oligodendrocytes with disrupted mood regulation. Low density and reduced
   expression of oligodendrocyte-specific gene transcripts in postmortem
   human subjects points toward decreased oligodendrocyte function in most
   of the major mental illnesses. Similar features are observed in rodent
   models of stress-induced depressive-like phenotypes, such as the
   unpredictable chronic mild stress and chronic corticosterone exposure,
   suggesting an effect downstream from stress. However, whether
   oligodendrocyte changes are a causal component of psychiatric phenotypes
   is not known. Traditional views that identify oligodendrocytes solely as
   nonfunctional support cells are being challenged, and recent studies
   suggest a more dynamic role for oligodendrocytes in neuronal functioning
   than previously considered, with the region adjacent to the node of
   Ranvier (i.e., paranode) considered a critical region of glial-neuronal
   interaction. Here, we briefly review the current knowledge regarding
   oligodendrocyte disruptions in psychiatric disorders and related animal
   models, with a focus on major depression. We then highlight several
   rodent studies, which suggest that alterations in oligodendrocyte
   structure and function can produce behavioral changes that are
   informative of mood regulatory mechanisms. Together, these studies
   suggest a model, whereby impaired oligodendrocyte and possibly paranode
   structure and function can impact neural circuitry, leading to
   downstream effects related to emotionality in rodents, and potentially
   to mood regulation in human psychiatric disorders. Translational

TI RNA/DNA ratios in American glass eels (Anguilla rostrata): evidence for
   latitudinal variation in physiological status and constraints to oceanic
   migration?
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB During their larval leptocephalus phase, newly hatched American eels
   undergo an extensive oceanic migration from the Sargasso Sea toward
   coastal and freshwater habitats. Their subsequent metamorphosis into
   glass eel is accompanied by drastic morphological and physiological
   changes preceding settlement over a wide geographic range. The main
   objective of this study was to compare RNA/DNA ratios and condition
   factor among glass eels in order to test the null hypothesis of no
   difference in physiological status and metabolic activity of glass eels
   at the outcome of their oceanic migration. This was achieved by
   analyzing glass eel samples collected at the mouth of 17 tributaries
   covering a latitudinal gradient across the species distribution range
   from Florida to Gaspesie (Quebec). Our main observations were (i) a
   latitudinal increase in mean total length; (ii) a latitudinal variation
   in mean RNA/DNA ratios, which was best explained by a quadratic model
   reaching its minimum in the central range of sampling locations; and
   (iii) a latitudinal variation in Fulton's condition factor, which was
   best explained by a quadratic model reaching its maximum in the central
   range of sampling locations. Below we discuss the possible links between
   latitudinal variation in glass eel physiological status and variable
   energetic and environmental constraints to oceanic migration as a
   function of latitudinal distribution.

TI New and old knowledge on differentiated thyroid cancer epidemiology and
   risk factors
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) represents 1-2% of all human
   malignancies. The annual incidence varies among countries and it is
   estimated that 1.2-2.6 men and 2.0-3.8 women/100,000 individuals are
   affected worldwide. This incidence has been increasing in the last
   decades, likely due to an "over-diagnosis" of small cancers that would
   have remained occult and that have been likely revealed because of an
   increased diagnostic scrutiny rather than a real increase of incidence.
   The annual mortality rate for DTC is 0.5/100,000 both in men and women.
   DTC is 2-4 times more frequent in females than in males. The mean age at
   diagnosis is 40-45 yr for papillary tumors (PTC) and 50-55 yr for
   follicular tumors (FTC). They are very rare in children. Ninety percent
   of DTC are represented by PTC hystotype, mainly follicular and classical
   variants. In the last years it has been observed an important change in
   the oncogenic pattern of PTC with a significant reduction of RET/PTC
   rearrangements and an increase of BRAF(V600E) mutation suggesting a
   change in pathogenic events. The unique well-demonstrated risk factor of
   DTC is the exposure to external radiation which is also correlated with
   the presence of RET/PTC rearrangements. Recently, other environmental
   factors (i.e. living in a volcanic area or in a iodine- either deficient
   or rich area) or some eating habits leading to obesity have been
   considered as potential DTC risk factors. However, at present, the
   favorite hypothesis is that a complex interaction between genetic and
   environmental factors is required to develop DTC. [J. Endocrinol.

TI Aquatic habitat use by amphibians with specific reference to Rana
   temporaria at high elevations (Retezat Mountains National Park, Romania)
SO ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
AB Alpine areas are extreme habitats that require special adaptations and
   involve major trade-offs in terms of life history. Amphibians have the
   ability to adapt both their life history and developmental traits to
   alpine environments. Temperate amphibians depend on the quality and
   availability of aquatic habitats for reproduction. We explored the
   aquatic habitat used by amphibians in the alpine area of Retezat
   Mountains, Southern Carpathians, Romania. We surveyed 40 aquatic
   habitats in a 380 ha area delimited by mountain crests and drained by a
   steep valley. Each aquatic habitat was characterized using 10
   environmental variables. Only three amphibian species occur at
   elevations above 1900 m, the most widespread being the Common Frog Rana
   temporaria. The Common Frog showed preference for breeding aquatic
   habitats, the variables of importance being altitude, solar radiation,
   water chemistry and grazing. Higher elevation and lower solar radiation
   decreased frog occurrence, while the impact of grazing favored the use
   of water bodies. Acidification is eminent in the area with pH dropping
   below 5 in 20% of the water bodies. Overall, amphibian occurrence in
   alpine area can be partly explained by the characteristics of aquatic
   habitats.

TI Tumour morphology of early-onset breast cancers predicts breast cancer
   risk for first-degree relatives: the Australian Breast Cancer Family
   Registry
SO BREAST CANCER RESEARCH
AB Introduction: We hypothesised that breast cancer risk for relatives of
   women with early-onset breast cancer could be predicted by tumour
   morphological features.
   Methods: We studied female first-degree relatives of a population-based
   sample of 452 index cases with a first primary invasive breast cancer
   diagnosed before the age of 40 years. For the index cases, a
   standardised tumour morphology review had been conducted for all;
   estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status was available for
   401 (89%), and 77 (17%) had a high-risk mutation in a breast cancer
   susceptibility gene or methylation of the BRCA1 promoter region in
   peripheral blood DNA. We calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIR)
   by comparing the number of mothers and sisters with breast cancer with
   the number expected based on Australian incidence rates specific for age
   and year of birth.
   Results: Using Cox proportional hazards modelling, absence of extensive
   sclerosis, extensive intraductal carcinoma, absence of acinar and
   glandular growth patterns, and the presence of trabecular and lobular
   growth patterns were independent predictors with between a 1.8- and
   3.1-fold increased risk for relatives (all P <0.02). Excluding index
   cases with known genetic predisposition or BRCA1 promoter methylation,
   absence of extensive sclerosis, circumscribed growth, extensive
   intraductal carcinoma and lobular growth pattern were independent
   predictors with between a 2.0- and 3.3-fold increased risk for relatives
   (all P < 0.02). Relatives of the 128 (34%) index cases with none of
   these four features were at population risk (SIR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.57
   to 1.85) while relatives of the 37 (10%) index cases with two or more
   features were at high risk (SIR = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.22 to 8.33).
   Conclusions: This wide variation in risks for relatives based on tumour
   characteristics could be of clinical value, help discover new breast
   cancer susceptibility genes and be an advance on the current clinical
   practice of using ER and PR as pathology-based predictors of familial
   and possibly genetic risks.

TI Total and free iodothyronines profile in the donkey (Equus asinus) over
   a 12-month period
SO ACTA VETERINARIA BRNO
AB Several studies show the correlation between thyroid function and
   reproductive activity in horses, but no data are available in donkeys.
   The aim of this study was to determine physiological thyroid changes
   occurring in 10 pregnant and 14 barren donkeys over a period of 12
   months. Blood samples were collected monthly from the jugular vein of
   pregnant and barren donkeys from June 2008 to June 2009. No significant
   differences (P < 0.05) in iodothyronine concentrations were observed
   between pregnant and barren donkeys in the same month. Seasonal total
   thyroxine (T(4)) and free triiodothyronine (fT(3)) patterns remained
   unmodified, regardless of physiological state, with the lowest T(4)
   levels at September and the highest at February, and the lowest fT(3)
   levels at June and the highest at July, in both pregnant and barren
   donkeys. Ranges of total triiodothyronine (T(3)) concentrations in
   pregnant donkeys over a 12 months period ranged from 1.57 to 2.90
   nmol/l, T(4) from 31.01 to 63.67 nmol/l, fT(3) from 3.15 to 15.52 pmol/l
   and free thyroxine (fT(4)) from 22.47 to 33.69 pmol/l. Mean T(3)
   concentrations in barren donkeys over a 12 months period ranged from
   1.64 to 3.37 nmol/l, T(4) from 42.95 nmol/l and 61.90 nmol/l, fT(3) from
   3.15 to 11.19 pmol/l and fT(4) from 25.46 to 35.06 pmol/l. This is the
   first study that provided a seasonal thyroid hormonal profile in healthy
   barren and pregnant donkeys.

TI Environmental Epigenetics and Its Implication on Disease Risk and Health
   Outcomes
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB This review focuses on how environmental factors through epigenetics
   modify disease risk and health outcomes. Major epigenetic events, such
   as histone modifi cations, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression, are
   described. The function of dose, duration, composition, and window of
   exposure in remodeling the individual's epigenetic terrain and disease
   susceptibility are addressed. The ideas of lifelong editing of
   early-life epigenetic memories, transgenerational effects through
   germline transmission, and the potential role of hydroxylmethylation of
   cytosine in developmental reprogramming are discussed. Finally, the
   epigenetic effects of several major classes of environmental factors are
   reviewed in the context of pathogenesis of disease. These include
   endocrine disruptors, tobacco smoke, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   infectious pathogens, particulate matter, diesel exhaust particles, dust
   mites, fungi, heavy metals, and other indoor and outdoor pollutants. We
   conclude that the summation of epigenetic modifi cations induced by
   multiple environmental exposures, accumulated over time, represented as
   broad or narrow, acute or chronic, developmental or lifelong, may
   provide a more precise assessment of risk and consequences. Future
   investigations may focus on their use as readouts or biomarkers of the
   totality of past exposure for the prediction of future disease risk and
   the prescription of effective countermeasures.

TI Thyroid Transcription Factor 1 and Napsin A Double Stain: Utilizing
   Different Vendor Antibodies for Diagnosing Lung Adenocarcinoma
SO ACTA CYTOLOGICA
AB Objective: A combined thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and Napsin
   A double stain has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of
   adenocarcinoma (ADC). This study compares differences in double staining
   patterns among vendor antibodies (Leica, Dako, and Biocare). Study
   Design:The cohorts included 35 FNA cell blocks of lung ADC and 24 cell
   blocks of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCCA). Double-staining
   immunohistochemistry was performed with TTF-1 as a brown nuclear stain
   and Napsin A as a red cytoplasmic stain, using three sets of double
   stains. Additionally, FISH expression was performed on SqCCAs with
   aberrant TIE-1 expression. Results: The sensitivity for the double
   stains ranged from 40 to 74%, while the specificity ranged from 88 to
   96%. Two Leica TTF-1-positive SqCCAs also showed low-level amplification
   by FISH assay not seen in the TTF-1-negative control SqCCAs. Conclusion:
   The use of Dako TIE-1 antibody paired with Leica Napsin A antibody as a
   double stain yielded the best results for diagnosing ADC; additionally,
   the Leica Napsin A-only staining results had the highest positive
   predictive value at 97%. Both Dako and Biocare antibodies expressed less
   staining of SqCCAs than Leica staining. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG,

TI Proteogenomic characterization and mapping of nucleosomes decoded by Brd
   and HP1 proteins
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) constitute a
   branch of epigenetic mechanisms that can control the expression of
   eukaryotic genes in a heritable manner. Recent studies have identified
   several PTM-binding proteins containing diverse specialized domains
   whose recognition of specific PTM sites leads to gene activation or
   repression. Here, we present a high-throughput proteogenomic platform
   designed to characterize the nucleosomal make-up of chromatin enriched
   with a set of histone PTM binding proteins known as histone PTM readers.
   We support our findings with gene expression data correlating to PTM
   distribution.
   Results: We isolated human mononucleosomes bound by the
   bromodomain-containing proteins Brd2, Brd3 and Brd4, and by the
   chromodomain-containing heterochromatin proteins HP1 beta and HP1 alpha.
   Histone PTMs were quantified by mass spectrometry (ChIP-qMS), and their
   associated DNAs were mapped using deep sequencing. Our results reveal
   that Brd- and HP1-bound nucleosomes are enriched in histone PTMs
   consistent with actively transcribed euchromatin and silent
   heterochromatin, respectively. Data collected using RNA-Seq show that
   Brd-bound sites correlate with highly expressed genes. In particular,
   Brd3 and Brd4 are most enriched on nucleosomes located within HOX gene
   clusters, whose expression is reduced upon Brd4 depletion by short
   hairpin RNA.
   Conclusions: Proteogenomic mapping of histone PTM readers, alongside the
   characterization of their local chromatin environments and
   transcriptional information, should prove useful for determining how
   histone PTMs are bound by these readers and how they contribute to
   distinct transcriptional states.

TI New insight in the follow-up strategies of differentiated thyroid cancer
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), either papillary or follicular,
   has usually a very good prognosis with an overall mortality of less than
   10%. In recent decades, the clinical presentation of DTC has been
   changing from advanced cases requiring intense treatment and
   surveillance to cancer detected by fortuitous neck ultrasonography
   requiring less aggressive treatment and follow-up. Given the changing
   presentation of DTC in the last years, the aim of DTC follow-up is to
   ensure the most effective and less invasive follow-up for a disease that
   nowadays is mostly cured just with surgery and is rarely fatal. The
   concept of "Ongoing Risk Stratification" or "Delayed Risk
   Stratification" which better define the patient risk based on the
   results of the initial treatment, can maximize the, beneficial effects
   of aggressive therapy in patients with DTC who are likely to benefit
   from it, while minimizing potential complications and side effects in
   low-risk patients who will achieve complete remission. [J. Endocrinol.

TI EFFECTS OF INDUCED MATERNAL HYPOTHYROIDISM ON THE OVARIAN DEVELOPMENT OF
   OFFSPRING RATS
SO ACTA VETERINARIA-BEOGRAD
AB The effects of propylthyouracil (PTU) induced hypothyroidism of rats
   during pregnancy and lactation on offspring ovarian development and
   maturation were studied. Thyroid hormones and thyroid stimulating
   hormone (TSH) concentrations were determined using the radioimmunoassay
   method in order to verify the hypothyroid status of treated mothers and
   their two months old pups. The ovaries of the offspring were processed
   for light microscopy analysis on the day of the first estrus after the
   60th day of age. Histological analysis including follicle count was
   performed on serial sections stained with haematoxyline/eosin and on
   semithin sections stained with methylene blue. A significant increase of
   serum TSH and decrease in T(3) and T(4) levels was observed in treated
   mothers compared to controls. The levels of measured hormones in the
   control and PTU-treated two months old rats were not significantly
   different. Ten percent of 60-day-old treated females did not reach
   estrus and they were sacrificed in diestrus. The secondary interstitial
   cells were the dominant structures in the ovaries. The number of healthy
   growing and early antral follicles was markedly decreased. Ovaries of
   treated rats contained relatively few antral follicles, significantly
   more atretic antral follicles and a decreased number of corpora lutea,
   compared to controls. These results indicate that lack of thyroid
   hormones during prenatal and early postnatal development impair ovarian
   development in rats.

TI The ADAR protein family
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional
   process by which adenosines are selectively converted to inosines in
   double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. A highly conserved group of
   enzymes, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, mediates
   this reaction. All ADARs share a common domain architecture consisting
   of a variable number of amino-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs)
   and a carboxy-terminal catalytic deaminase domain. ADAR family members
   are highly expressed in the metazoan nervous system, where these enzymes
   predominantly localize to the neuronal nucleus. Once in the nucleus,
   ADARs participate in the modification of specific adenosines in
   pre-mRNAs of proteins involved in electrical and chemical
   neurotransmission, including pre-synaptic release machineries, and
   voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Most RNA editing sites in these
   nervous system targets result in non-synonymous codon changes in
   functionally important, usually conserved, residues and RNA editing
   deficiencies in various model organisms bear out a crucial role for
   ADARs in nervous system function. Mutation or deletion of ADAR genes
   results in striking phenotypes, including seizure episodes, extreme
   uncoordination, and neurodegeneration. Not only does the process of RNA
   editing alter important nervous system peptides, but ADARs also regulate
   gene expression through modification of dsRNA substrates that enter the
   RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and may then act at the chromatin level.
   Here, we present a review on the current knowledge regarding the ADAR
   protein family, including evolutionary history, key structural features,
   localization, function and mechanism.

TI Concentration of selected transition metals in layer hens non-infested
   and infested with Dermanyssus gallinae
SO ACTA VETERINARIA BRNO
AB The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of selected
   transition metals, i.e. iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the
   livers of laying hens free from and infested with the red mite
   (Dermanyssus gallinae) and to explain the effects of the invasion of
   this parasite on the content of those elements. The study was carried
   out on 24 Hy-Line Brown hens bred in battery cages. The birds were
   divided into two groups, free from and infested with D. gallinae.
   Concentration of analysed metals was determined using atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry. Based on this experiment, it was proved that a
   long-term (52 weeks) exposure of hens to D. gallinae resulted in a
   significant (P < 0.05) decrease of Fe, Cu and Zn in the liver. The mean
   content of analysed metals in the group infested with the parasite
   amounted to 31.42 mg Fe/kg, 2.71 mg Cu/kg and 22.64 mg/kg, whereas in
   the non-infested group it was 38.51 mg Fe/kg, 3.12 mg Cu/kg and 26.53 mg
   Zn/kg. No significant (P < 0.05) alterations in haematological
   indicators were found between the examined groups of birds. The results
   may suggest that 3 weeks of recovery in hens are sufficient to bring
   about a considerable increase in concentration of analysed transition
   metals in the liver.

TI Tissue of origin determines cancer-associated CpG island promoter
   hypermethylation patterns
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Aberrant CpG island promoter DNA hypermethylation is
   frequently observed in cancer and is believed to contribute to tumor
   progression by silencing the expression of tumor suppressor genes.
   Previously, we observed that promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer
   reflects cell lineage rather than tumor progression and occurs at genes
   that are already repressed in a lineage-specific manner. To investigate
   the generality of our observation we analyzed the methylation profiles
   of 1,154 cancers from 7 different tissue types.
   Results: We find that 1,009 genes are prone to hypermethylation in these
   7 types of cancer. Nearly half of these genes varied in their
   susceptibility to hypermethylation between different cancer types. We
   show that the expression status of hypermethylation prone genes in the
   originator tissue determines their propensity to become hypermethylated
   in cancer; specifically, genes that are normally repressed in a tissue
   are prone to hypermethylation in cancers derived from that tissue. We
   also show that the promoter regions of hypermethylation-prone genes are
   depleted of repetitive elements and that DNA sequence around the same
   promoters is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that these two
   characteristics reflect tissue-specific gene promoter architecture
   regulating the expression of these hypermethylation prone genes in
   normal tissues.
   Conclusions: As aberrantly hypermethylated genes are already repressed
   in pre-cancerous tissue, we suggest that their hypermethylation does not
   directly contribute to cancer development via silencing. Instead
   aberrant hypermethylation reflects developmental history and the
   perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms maintaining these repressed
   promoters in a hypomethylated state in normal cells.

TI Psychological Stress Delays Periodontitis Healing in Rats: The

SO MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION
AB Objective. To evaluate the effects of psychological stress on
   periodontitis healing in rats and the contribution of basic fibroblast
   growth factor (bFGF) expression to the healing process. Methods.
   Ninety-six rats were randomly distributed into control group,
   periodontitis group, and periodontitis plus stress group. Then, the rats
   were sacrificed at baseline and week(s) 1, 2, and 4. The periodontitis
   healing condition was assessed, and the expression of interleukin-1 beta
   (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and bFGF were
   tested by immunohistochemistry. Results. The stressed rats showed
   reduced body weight gain, behavioral changes, and increased serum
   corticosterone and ACTH levels (P < 0.05). The surface of inflammatory
   infiltrate, alveolar bone loss, attachment loss, and expression of IL-1
   beta and TNF-alpha in the stress group were higher than those in the
   periodontitis group at weeks 2 and 4 (P < 0.05). Rats with experimental
   periodontitis showed decreased bFGF expression (P < 0.05), and the
   recovery of bFGF expression in the stress group was slower than that in
   the periodontitis group (P < 0.05). Negative correlations between
   inflammatory cytokines and bFGF were detected. Conclusion. Psychological
   stress could delay periodontitis healing in rats, which may be partly
   mediated by downregulation of the expression of bFGF in the periodontal
   ligament.

TI Chronic exposure to stress hormones alters the subtype of store-operated
   channels expressed in H19-7 hippocampal neuronal cells
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Differentiating H19-7 hippocampal precursor cells up-regulate
   (approximate to 4.3-fold) store-operated channel (SOC) activity;
   relatively linear current-voltage curves indicate an ISOC subtype of
   SOC. In differentiated H19-7 neurons, the majority of agonist (arginine
   vasopressin, AVP)-stimulated Ca2+ entry occurs via SOCs, based on
   2-aminoethyldiphenylborinate (2-APB) inhibition data and the observation
   that transient receptor potential C1 (TRPC1) channel knock down cells
   show a dramatic reduction of thapsigargin-stimulated store-operated Ca2+
   entry (SOCE) and inhibition of AVP-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Treatment of
   H19-7 cells with the rat stress hormone corticosterone during
   differentiation induces a significant increase in AVP-stimulated Ca2+
   entry, which is virtually eliminated by 2-APB, suggesting a
   corticosterone-induced increase of SOCE. Corticosterone also enhances
   AVP-stimulated Mn2+ entry, confirming an elevated Ca2+ entry pathway,
   rather than a decreased Ca2+ extrusion. When corticosterone addition is
   delayed until after H19-7 cells have fully differentiated, it still
   elevates SOCE. In corticosterone-treated H19-7 cells, the knock down of
   TRPC1 no longer blocks thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry suggesting
   that the subtype of SOCs expressed in H19-7 cells is altered by
   corticosterone treatment. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that
   store-operated currents in corticosterone-treated H19-7 cells exhibit a
   highly inward rectifying current-voltage curve consistent with an ICRAC
   subtype of SOCs. Consistent with this finding is the observation that
   corticosterone treatment of H19-7 cells increases the expression of the
   ICRAC channel subunit Orai1. Thus, the subtype of SOCs expressed in
   H19-7 hippocampal neurons can be altered from ISOC to ICRAC by chronic
   treatment with stress hormones. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 13321343, 2013.

TI Differential methylation of E2 binding sites in episomal and integrated
   HPV 16 genomes in preinvasive and invasive cervical lesions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Enhanced expression of the HPV 16 E6-E7 oncogenes may trigger neoplastic
   transformation of the squamous epithelial cells at the uterine cervix.
   The HPV E2 protein is a key transcriptional regulator of the E6-E7
   genes. It binds to four E2 binding sites (E2BSs 14) in the viral
   upstream regulatory region (URR). Modification of E2 functions, for
   example, by methylation of E2BSs is hypothesized to trigger enhanced
   expression of the viral E6-E7 oncogenes. In the majority of
   HPV-transformed premalignant lesions and about half of cervical
   carcinomas HPV genomes persist in an extra-chromosomal, episomal state,
   whereas they are integrated into host cells chromosomes in the remaining
   lesions. Here we compared the methylation profile of E2BSs 14 of the HPV
   16 URR in a series of 18 HPV16-positive premalignant lesions and 33
   invasive cervical cancers. CpGs within the E2BSs 1, 3, and 4 were higher
   methylated in all lesions with only episomal HPV16 genomes compared with
   lesions displaying single integrated copies. Samples with multiple HPV16
   integrated copies displayed high methylation levels for all CpGs
   suggesting that the majority of multiple copies were silenced by
   extensive methylation. These data support the hypothesis that
   differential methylation of the E2BSs 1, 3 and 4 is related to the
   activation of viral oncogene expression in cervical lesions as long as
   the viral genome remains in the episomal state. Once the virus becomes
   integrated into host cell chromosomes these methylation patterns may be
   substantially altered due to complex epigenetic changes of integrated
   HPV genomes.

TI DOT1L-Mediated H3K79 Methylation in Chromatin Is Dispensable for Wnt
   Pathway-Specific and Other Intestinal Epithelial Functions
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB Methylation of H3K79 is associated with chromatin at expressed genes,
   though it is unclear if this histone modification is required for
   transcription of all genes. Recent studies suggest that Wnt-responsive
   genes depend particularly on H3K79 methylation, which is catalyzed by
   the methyltransferase DOT1L. Human leukemias carrying MLL gene
   rearrangements show DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation and aberrant
   expression of leukemogenic genes. DOT1L inhibitors reverse these
   effects, but their clinical use is potentially limited by toxicity in
   Wnt-dependent tissues such as intestinal epithelium. Genome-wide
   positioning of the H3K79me2 mark in Lgr5(+) mouse intestinal stem cells
   and mature intestinal villus epithelium correlated with expression
   levels of all transcripts and not with Wnt-responsive genes per se.
   Selective Dot1l disruption in Lgr5(+) stem cells or in whole intestinal
   epithelium eliminated H3K79me2 from the respective compartments,
   allowing genetic evaluation of DOT1L requirements. The absence of
   methylated H3K79 did not impair health, intestinal homeostasis, or
   expression of Wnt target genes in crypt epithelium for up to 4 months,
   despite increased crypt cell apoptosis. Global transcript profiles in
   Dot1l-null cells were barely altered. Thus, H3K79 methylation is not
   essential for transcription of Wnt-responsive or other intestinal genes,
   and intestinal toxicity is not imperative when DOT1L is rendered
   inactive in vivo.

TI Different patterns of DNA methylation of the two distinct
   O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (O-6-MGMT) promoter regions in
   colorectal cancer
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide.
   Colorectal cancer incidence differs widely among different geographic
   regions. In addition to mutational changes, epigenetic mechanisms also
   play important roles in the pathogenesis of CRCs. O6-methylguanine-DNA
   methyltransferase (O (6) -MGMT) is a DNA repair protein and in the
   absence of MGMT activity, G-to-A transition may accumulate in the
   specific genes such as K-ras and p53. To identify which CpG sites are
   critical for its downregulation, we analyzed the methylation status of
   the MGMT gene promoter in two sites in CRC patients. Then we compared
   the frequency of their methylation changes with the results of our
   previously reported K-ras gene mutation, APC2 and p16 methylation. MGMT
   methylation was examined in 92 tumor samples. A methylation specific PCR
   (MSP) method was performed for two loci of MGMT gene which described as
   MGMT-A and MGMT-B. The prevalence of MGMT-A, and MGMT-B methylation was
   49/91 (53.8 %), and 83/92 (90.2 %), respectively. We detected high
   frequency of MGMT-B but not MGMT-A methylation in tumor tissues with
   APC2 methylation. Our results showed that MGMT-B methylation is
   significantly associated with K-ras gene mutation rather than MGMT-A (p
   = 0.04). Simultaneously, an inverse correlation was found between p16
   and MGMT-B methylation simultaneously (p = 0.02). Our study indicated
   that hypermethylation of the specific locus near the MGMT start codon is
   critical for cancer progression. MGMT-B assessment that is associated
   with K-ras mutation can have a prognostic value in patients with CRC.

TI EpsteinBarr virus-induced epigenetic alterations following transient
   infection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) is a known tumor virus associated with an
   increasing array of malignancies; however, the association of the virus
   with certain malignancies is often erratic. To determine EBV's
   contributions to tumorigenesis in a setting of incomplete association, a
   transient model of infection was established where a clonal CCL185
   carcinoma cell line infected with recombinant EBV was allowed to lose
   viral genomes by withdrawal of selection pressure. Global gene
   expression comparing EBV-negative, transiently infected clones to
   uninfected controls identified expression changes in more than 1,000
   genes. Among downregulated genes, several genes known to be
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylated in cancer were identified
   including E-cadherin and PYCARD. A cadherin switch, increased motility
   and enhanced cellular invasiveness present in EBV-positive cells were
   retained after viral loss, indicating an epigenetic effect. Repression
   of PYCARD expression was a result of increased promoter CpG methylation,
   whereas loss of E-cadherin expression after transient EBV infection did
   not correlate with increased DNA methylation of the E-cadherin promoter.
   Rather, repression of E-cadherin was consistent with the formation of a
   repressive chromatin state. Decreased histone 3 or 4 acetylation at the
   promoter and 5 end of the E-cadherin gene was observed in an
   EBV-negative, transiently infected clone relative to the uninfected
   controls. These results suggest that EBV can stably alter gene
   expression in a heritable fashion in formerly infected cells, whereas
   its own contribution to the oncogenic process is masked.

TI BRAF mutation and RASSF1A expression in thyroid carcinoma of southern
   Italy
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Aim of this work is to provide a detailed comparison of
   clinical-pathologic features between well-differentiated and poorly
   differentiated tumors according to their BRAF and RASSF1A status. We
   analyzed RASSF1A methylation by MSP and BRAF mutation by LCRT-PCR with
   LightMix (R) kit BRAF V600E in neoplastic thyroid tissues.
   Immunohistochemical evaluation of RASSF1A expression was also performed
   by standard automated LSAB-HRP technique. An overall higher degree of
   RASSF1A over-expression than normal thyroid parenchyma surrounding
   tumors (P<0.05) has been found in all malignant well-differentiated
   lesions. Moreover, statistically significant higher levels of RASSF1A
   expression were observed in differentiated cancers associated to an
   inflammatory autoimmune background (P=0.01). Amplifiable DNA for LC PCR
   with LightMix (R) kit BRAF V600E was obtained in nine PTCs, four FVPTCs,
   five ATCs, and one control. The V600E mutation was found in 13 of 18
   (72%) tumors. BRAF was mutated in 6 of 9 (66%) classical PTC, in 2 of 4
   (50%) follicular variant PTC and in all ACs (100%). The overall
   frequency of RASSF1A promoter methylation observed was 20.5% (9 cases
   out 44). Hypermethylation of RASSF1A in primary tumors was variable
   according to histotypes ranging from100% (5/5) in ACs to only 12.5%
   (4/32) in PTCs. We show a correlation between RASSF1A methylation status
   and RASSF1A protein expression. Finally, we conclude that BRAF V600E
   mutation and RASSF1A methylation were pathogenetic event restricted to a
   subgroup of PTC/FVPTCs in early stage and to clinically aggressive ATCs.

TI Phosphodiesterase-2 inhibitor reverses corticosterone-induced
   neurotoxicity and related behavioural changes via cGMP/PKG dependent
   pathway
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) is an enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of
   cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate
   (cGMP) to restrict intracellular signalling of these second messenger
   molecules. This study investigated how PDE2 inhibitor Bay 60-7550
   affects the dysregulated glucocorticoid signalling in neuronal cells and
   regulates depressive behaviours after chronic stress in mice. We found
   that exposure of hippocampal neurons to corticosterone resulted in
   time-and concentration-dependent increases in PDE2 expression. These
   intriguing findings were confirmed in the hippocampal cell line HT-22.
   After corticosterone exposure for 24 h, HT-22 cells showed a
   concentration-dependent increase in mRNA levels for PDE2 subtypes,
   PDE2A1 and 2A3, as well as for the total PDE2A protein expression. Bay
   60-7550 was found to reverse the cell lesion induced by corticosterone
   (50 mu M). This neuroprotective effect was blocked by pretreatment with
   protein kinase G inhibitor KT5823, but not protein kinase A inhibitor
   H89, suggesting the involvement of cGMP-dependent signalling. Although
   Bay 60-7550 treatment for 24 h did not change the levels of
   phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 (pERK) and
   phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB), it
   down-regulated pERK at 2 h and up-regulated a CREB co-activator,
   CREB-binding protein, at 24 h. Both of these effects were blocked by KT
   5823. Furthermore, Bay 60-7550 reversed corticosterone-induced
   down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels 24 h
   after corticosterone exposure. In behavioural testing, Bay 60-7550
   produced antidepressant-like effects and reduced corticosterone levels
   in stressed mice, further supporting the involvement of a PDE2-dependent
   pathway in mediating Bay 60-7550's effect during stress hormone insults.

TI Developmentally Programmed 3 ' CpG Island Methylation Confers Tissue-
   and Cell-Type-Specific Transcriptional Activation
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB During development, a small but significant number of CpG islands (CGIs)
   become methylated. The timing of developmentally programmed CGI
   methylation and associated mechanisms of transcriptional regulation
   during cellular differentiation, however, remain poorly characterized.
   Here, we used genome-wide DNA methylation microarrays to identify
   epigenetic changes during human embryonic stem cell (hESC)
   differentiation. We discovered a group of CGIs associated with
   developmental genes that gain methylation after hESCs differentiate.
   Conversely, erasure of methylation was observed at the identified CGIs
   during subsequent reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs), further supporting a functional role for the CGI methylation.
   Both global gene expression profiling and quantitative reverse
   transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) validation indicated opposing effects of CGI
   methylation in transcriptional regulation during differentiation, with
   promoter CGI methylation repressing and 3' CGI methylation activating
   transcription. By studying diverse human tissues and mouse models, we
   further confirmed that developmentally programmed 3' CGI methylation
   confers tissue- and cell-type-specific gene activation in vivo.
   Importantly, luciferase reporter assays provided evidence that 3' CGI
   methylation regulates transcriptional activation via a CTCF-dependent
   enhancer-blocking mechanism. These findings expand the classic view of
   mammalian CGI methylation as a mechanism for transcriptional silencing
   and indicate a functional role for 3' CGI methylation in developmental
   gene regulation.

TI Sulforaphane enhances Nrf2 expression in prostate cancer TRAMP C1 cells
   through epigenetic regulation
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB Growing evidence suggests epigenetic alteration is involved during the
   development and progression of prostate cancer. Previously, we found
   Nrf2, a key regulator of cellular antioxidant defense systems, was
   silenced through epigenetic mechanism during tumorigenesis in vivo TRAMP
   mice and in vitro TRAMP Cl cells. Sulforaphane (SFN) in cruciferous
   vegetable has been demonstrated to be a potent cancer prevention agent
   for years. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of SFN
   to restore Nrf2 expression in TRAMP Cl cells through epigenetic
   modifications. Bisulfite genomic sequencing results indicated that SFN
   treatment led to demethylation of the first 5 CpGs in the promoter
   region of the Nrf2 gene in TRAMP Cl cells. Using methylation DNA
   immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) assay, SFN significantly reduced the ratio
   of anti-mecyt antibody binding to the Nrf2 promoter containing the first
   5 CpGs. SFN increased mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 and Nrf2
   downstream target gene NQO-1. In addition, SFN decreased the protein
   levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3a. SFN treatment also attenuated the protein
   expression levels of HDACs 1, 4, 5, and 7 while increased the level of
   active chromatin marker acetyl-Histone 3 (Ac-H3). SFN treatments also
   increased chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA of Nrf2 gene promoter using
   anti-Ac-H3 antibody. Taken together, our current study shows that SFN
   regulates Nrf2's CpGs demethylation and reactivation in TRAMP Cl cells,
   suggesting SFN may exert its chemopreventive effect in part via
   epigenetic modifications of Nrf2 gene with subsequent induction of its
   downstream anti-oxidative stress pathway. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Effect of chronic heroin and cocaine administration on global DNA
   methylation in brain and liver
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB Drug abuse is associated with epigenetic changes, such as histone
   modifications and DNA methylation. The purpose of the present study was
   to examine the effect of chronic cocaine and heroin administration on
   global DNA methylation in brain and liver. Male, 8 week old, C57BL/6J
   mice received heroin in a chronic 'intermittent' escalating dose
   paradigm, or cocaine in a chronic escalating dose 'binge' paradigm,
   which mimic the human pattern of opioid or cocaine abuse respectively.
   Following sacrifice, livers and brains were removed and DNA was
   extracted from them. The extracted DNA was hydrolyzed and
   2'-deoxycytidine and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine were determined by
   HPLC-UV. The % 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine content of DNA was
   significantly higher in the brain compared to the liver.
   There were no differences between the control animals and the cocaine or
   heroin treated animals in neither of the tissues examined, which is
   surprising since cocaine administration induced gross morphological
   changes in the liver. Moreover, there was no difference in the %
   5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine content of DNA between the cocaine and the
   heroin treated animals. The global DNA methylation status in the brain
   and liver of mice chronically treated with cocaine or heroin remains
   unaffected, but this finding cannot exclude the existence of anatomical
   region or gene-specific methylation differences. This is the first time
   that global DNA methylation in the liver and whole brain has been
   studied following chronic cocaine or heroin treatment. (c) 2013 Elsevier

TI Gene expression and epigenetic discovery screen reveal methylation of
   SFRP2 in prostate cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Aberrant activation of Wnts is common in human cancers, including
   prostate. Hypermethylation associated transcriptional silencing of Wnt
   antagonist genes SFRPs (Secreted Frizzled-Related Proteins) is a
   frequent oncogenic event. The significance of this is not known in
   prostate cancer. The objectives of our study were to (i) profile Wnt
   signaling related gene expression and (ii) investigate methylation of
   Wnt antagonist genes in prostate cancer. Using TaqMan Low Density
   Arrays, we identified 15 Wnt signaling related genes with significantly
   altered expression in prostate cancer; the majority of which were
   upregulated in tumors. Notably, histologically benign tissue from men
   with prostate cancer appeared more similar to tumor (r = 0.76) than to
   benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Overall, the
   expression profile was highly similar between tumors of high ( 7) and
   low ( 6) Gleason scores. Pharmacological demethylation of PC-3 cells
   with 5-Aza-CdR reactivated 39 genes ( 2-fold); 40% of which inhibit Wnt
   signaling. Methylation frequencies in prostate cancer were 10% (2/20)
   (SFRP1), 64.86% (48/74) (SFRP2), 0% (0/20) (SFRP4) and 60% (12/20)
   (SFRP5). SFRP2 methylation was detected at significantly lower
   frequencies in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN;
   30%, (6/20), p = 0.0096), tumor adjacent benign areas (8.82%, (7/69), p
   < 0.0001) and BPH (11.43% (4/35), p < 0.0001). The quantitative level of
   SFRP2 methylation (normalized index of methylation) was also
   significantly higher in tumors (116) than in the other samples (HGPIN =
   7.45, HB = 0.47, and BPH = 0.12). We show that SFRP2 hypermethylation is
   a common event in prostate cancer. SFRP2 methylation in combination with
   other epigenetic markers may be a useful biomarker of prostate cancer.

TI MENT: Methylation and expression database of normal and tumor tissues
SO GENE
AB Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression can reveal
   specific epigenetic patterns that are important during carcinogenesis.
   We built an integrated database of DNA methylation and gene expression
   termed MENT (Methylation and Expression database of Normal and Tumor
   tissues) to provide researchers information on both DNA methylation and
   gene expression in diverse cancers. It contains integrated data of DNA
   methylation, gene expression, correlation of DNA methylation and gene
   expression in paired samples, and clinicopathological conditions
   gathered from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer
   Genome Atlas). A user-friendly interface allows users to search for
   differential DNA methylation by either 'gene search' or 'dataset
   search'. The 'gene search' returns which conditions are differentially
   methylated in a gene of interest, while 'dataset search' returns which
   genes are differentially methylated in a condition of interest based on
   filtering options such as direction, DM (differential methylation
   value), and p-value. MENT is the first database which provides both DNA
   methylation and gene expression information in diverse normal and tumor
   tissues. Its user-friendly interface allows users to easily search and
   view both DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. MENT is freely
   available at http://mgrc.kribb.re.kr:8080/MENT/. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI LinkNMF: Identification of histone modification modules in the human
   genome using nonnegative matrix factorization
SO GENE
AB Histone modifications are ubiquitous processes involved in various
   cellular mechanisms. Systemic analysis of multiple chromatin
   modifications has been used to characterize various chromatin states
   associated with functional DNA elements, gene expression, and specific
   biological functions. However, identification of modular modification
   patterns is still required to understand the functional associations
   between histone modification patterns and specific chromatin/DNA binding
   factors. To recognize modular modification patterns, we developed a
   novel algorithm that combines nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and
   a clique-detection algorithm. We applied it, called LinkNMF, to generate
   a comprehensive modification map in human CD4+ T cell promoter regions.
   Initially, we identified 11 modules not recognized by conventional
   approaches. The modules were grouped into two major classes: gene
   activation and repression. We found that genes targeted by each module
   were enriched with distinguishable biological functions, suggesting that
   each modular pattern plays a unique functional role. To explain the
   formation of modular patterns, we investigated the module-specific
   binding patterns of chromatin regulators. Application of LinkNMF to
   histone modification maps of diverse cells and developmental stages will
   be helpful for understanding how histone modifications regulate gene
   expression. The algorithm is available on our website at
   biodb.kaist.ac.kr/LinkNMF. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Discovering common combinatorial histone modification patterns in the

SO GENE
AB Histone modifications play a crucial role in regulating gene expression
   and cell lineage determination and maintenance at the epigenetic level.
   To systematically investigate this phenomenon, this paper presented a
   statistical hybrid clustering algorithm to identify common combinatorial
   histone modification patterns. We applied the algorithm to 39 histone
   modification marks in human CD4+ T cells and detected 854 common
   combinatorial histone modification patterns. Our results could cover 211
   (76.17%) patterns among 277 patterns identified by the tandem mass
   spectrometry experiments. Based on the frequency statistical analysis,
   it was found that the co-occurrence frequencies of 20 backbone
   modifications are greater than or close to 0.2 in the 854 patterns, we
   also found that 15 modifications (H2BK120ac, H4K91ac, H2BK20ac, etc.),
   three histone acetylations (H2AK9ac, H4K16ac, and H4K12ac) and five
   histone methylations (H3K79me1, H3K79me2, 3K79me3, H4K20me1, and
   H2BK5me1) were most likely prone to coexist respectively in these
   patterns. In addition, we found that DNA methylation tends to combine
   with histone acetylation rather than histone methylation. (c) 2012

TI Looking beyond the DNA sequence: the relevance of DNA methylation
   processes for the stress-diathesis model of depression
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and
   serotonergic (5-HT) system are known to be intertwined with mood.
   Alterations in these systems are often associated with depression.
   However, neither are sufficient to cause depression in and of
   themselves. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the environment
   plays a crucial role, particularly, the perinatal environment. In this
   review, we posit that early environmental stress triggers a series of
   epigenetic mechanisms that adapt the genome and programme the HPA axis
   and 5-HT system for survival in a harsh environment. We focus on DNA
   methylation as it is the most stable epigenetic mark. Given that DNA
   methylation patterns are in large part set within the perinatal period,
   long-term gene expression programming by DNA methylation is especially
   vulnerable to environmental insults during this period. We discuss
   specific examples of genes in the 5-HT system (serotonin transporter)
   and HPA axis (glucocorticoid receptor and arginine vasopressin enhancer)
   whose DNA methylation state is associated with early life experience and
   may potentially lead to depression vulnerability. We conclude with a
   discussion on the relevance of studying epigenetic mechanisms in
   peripheral tissue as a proxy for those occurring in the human brain and
   suggest avenues for future research.

TI Regulated Transcription of Human Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and
   Interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) Genes in Chondrocytes Depends on Methylation
   of Specific Proximal Promoter CpG Sites
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The role of DNA methylation in the regulation of catabolic genes such as
   MMP13 and IL1B, which have sparse CpG islands, is poorly understood in
   the context of musculoskeletal diseases. We report that demethylation of
   specific CpG sites at -110 bp and -299 bp of the proximal MMP13 and IL1B
   promoters, respectively, detected by in situ methylation analysis of
   chondrocytes obtained directly from human cartilage, strongly correlated
   with higher levels of gene expression. The methylation status of these
   sites had a significant impact on promoter activities in chondrocytes,
   as revealed in transfection experiments with site-directed CpG mutants
   in a CpG-free luciferase reporter. Methylation of the -110 and -299 CpG
   sites, which reside within a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) consensus
   motif in the respective MMP13 and IL1B promoters, produced the most
   marked suppression of their transcriptional activities. Methylation of
   the -110 bp CpG site in the MMP13 promoter inhibited its HIF-2
   alpha-driven transactivation and decreased HIF-2 alpha binding to the
   MMP13 proximal promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In
   contrast to HIF-2 alpha, MMP13 transcriptional regulation by other
   positive (RUNX2, AP-1, ELF3) and negative (Sp1, GATA1, and USF1) factors
   was not affected by methylation status. However, unlike the MMP13
   promoter, IL1B was not susceptible to HIF-2 alpha transactivation,
   indicating that the -299 CpG site in the IL1B promoter must interact
   with other transcription factors to modulate IL1B transcriptional
   activity. Taken together, our data reveal that the methylation of
   different CpG sites in the proximal promoters of the human MMP13 and
   IL1B genes modulates their transcription by distinct mechanisms.

TI Drosophila H1 Regulates the Genetic Activity of Heterochromatin by
   Recruitment of Su(var)3-9
SO SCIENCE
AB Eukaryotic genomes harbor transposable elements and other repetitive
   sequences that must be silenced. Small RNA interference pathways play a
   major role in their repression. Here, we reveal another mechanism for
   silencing these sequences in Drosophila. Depleting the linker histone H1
   in vivo leads to strong activation of these elements. H1-mediated
   silencing occurs in combination with the heterochromatin-specific
   histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase Su(var)3-9. H1 physically
   interacts with Su(var) 3-9 and recruits it to chromatin in vitro, which
   promotes H3 methylation. We propose that H1 plays a key role in
   silencing by tethering Su(var) 3-9 to heterochromatin. The tethering
   function of H1 adds to its established role as a regulator of chromatin
   compaction and accessibility.

   change the epigenetic landscape is poorly understood. The preponderance
   of covalent modifications on histone tails coupled with a relatively
   small number of functional outputs raises the possibility that chromatin
   acts as a site of signal integration and storage.

TI Melatonin supplementation in rat ameliorates ovariectomy-induced
   oxidative stress
SO CLIMACTERIC
AB Objective The present study aims to determine the potential of melatonin
   supplementation in ameliorating tissue oxidative stress, elevated serum
   corticosterone and hepatic and renal dysfunction.
   Materials and methods Adult Wistar rats, either ovariectomized or
   sham-operated, served as experimental or control groups, respectively.
   Rats received either melatonin, estrogen, progesterone or a combination
   of melatonin and estrogen for a period of 15 days. Tissue oxidative
   stress, serum markers of hepatic and renal dysfunction and serum
   corticosterone level formed the parameters of assay in all groups at the
   end of the treatment schedule.
   Results Ovariectomized rats showed significant increases in levels of
   tissue lipid peroxidation, serum levels of glutamic pyruvic
   transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase,
   acid phosphatase and corticosterone and significant decrement in
   enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status. All parameters showed
   maximal reversal to control levels on supplementation with high-dose
   melatonin or estrogen + melatonin treatment.
   Conclusion Melatonin supplementation proved better than estrogen
   replacement therapy, with the higher dose being more effective in
   preventing ovariectomy-induced increases in oxidative stress and serum
   levels of marker parameters of hepatic and renal dysfunction and
   corticosterone titer. Overall, melatonin supplementation therapy
   qualifies as a more potent and safe alternative to estrogen replacement
   therapy in alleviating postmenopausal increases in oxidative stress and
   hepatic and renal dysfunction.

TI Whole-genome methylation analysis of benign and malignant colorectal
   tumours
SO JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Changes in DNA methylation, whether hypo- or hypermethylation, have been
   shown to be associated with the progression of colorectal cancer.
   Methylation changes substantially in the progression from normal mucosa
   to adenoma and to carcinoma. This phenomenon has not been studied
   extensively and studies have been restricted to individual CpG islands,
   rather than taking a whole-genome approach. We aimed to study
   genome-wide methylation changes in colorectal cancer. We obtained 10
   fresh-frozen normal tissuecancer sample pairs, and five fresh-frozen
   adenoma samples. These were run on the lllumina HumanMethylation27
   whole-genome methylation analysis system. Differential methylation
   between normal tissue, adenoma and carcinoma was analysed using Bayesian
   regression modelling, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and
   hierarchical clustering (HC). The highest-rated individual gene for
   differential methylation in carcinomas versus normal tissue and adenomas
   versus normal tissue was GRASP (padjusted=1.59 x 105, BF = 12.62,
   padjusted=1.68 x 106, BF = 14.53). The highest-rated gene when comparing
   carcinomas versus adenomas was ATM (padjusted=2.0 x 104, BF = 10.17).
   Hierarchical clustering demonstrated poor clustering by the CIMP
   criteria for methylation. GSEA demonstrated methylation changes in the
   NetrinDCC and SLITROBO pathways. Widespread changes in DNA methylation
   are seen in the transition from adenoma to carcinoma. The finding that
   GRASP, which encodes the general receptor for phosphoinositide
   1-associated scaffold protein, was differentially methylated in
   colorectal cancer is interesting. This may be a potential biomarker for
   colorectal cancer. Copyright (c) 2012 Pathological Society of Great

TI Transcriptional regulation by histone modifications: towards a theory of
   chromatin re-organization during stem cell differentiation
SO PHYSICAL BIOLOGY
AB Chromatin-related mechanisms, as e. g. histone modifications, are known
   to be involved in regulatory switches within the transcriptome. Only
   recently, mathematical models of these mechanisms have been established.
   So far they have not been applied to genome-wide data. We here introduce
   a mathematical model of transcriptional regulation by histone
   modifications and apply it to data of trimethylation of histone 3 at
   lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and 27 (H3K27me3) in mouse pluripotent and
   lineage-committed cells. The model describes binding of protein
   complexes to chromatin which are capable of reading and writing histone
   marks. Molecular interactions of the complexes with DNA and modified
   histones create a regulatory switch of transcriptional activity. The
   regulatory states of the switch depend on the activity of histone (de-)
   methylases, the strength of complex-DNA-binding and the number of
   nucleosomes capable of cooperatively contributing to complex-binding.
   Our model explains experimentally measured length distributions of
   modified chromatin regions. It suggests (i) that high CpG-density
   facilitates recruitment of the modifying complexes in embryonic stem
   cells and (ii) that re-organization of extended chromatin regions during
   lineage specification into neuronal progenitor cells requires targeted
   de-modification. Our approach represents a basic step towards
   multi-scale models of transcriptional control during development and
   lineage specification.

TI Thyroid dysfunction in the elderly
SO NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Thyroid dysfunction is common in the general population, and mild or
   subclinical forms can be present in more than 10% of individuals aged >
   80 years. The diagnosis of abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations in
   people aged > 60 years poses a challenge, as the clinical presentation
   of thyroid dysfunction is usually nonspecific, and ageing is associated
   with a number of physiological changes that can affect thyroid function
   test results. Furthermore, the presence of acute or chronic nonthyroidal
   illnesses and the use of medications that interfere with thyroid
   function tests are common confounders in the determination of thyroid
   status in the elderly. Early diagnosis and treatment of overt thyroid
   dysfunction is crucial in this population in view of the marked effects
   of abnormal circulating thyroid hormone levels on a number of organ
   systems, including the heart, the skeleton and the neurological system.
   The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity
   remains uncertain, and the need for treatment of subclinical thyroid
   dysfunction is much debated. A number of large epidemiological studies
   have identified associations between mild thyroid dysfunction and
   short-term as well as long-term adverse outcomes, and a small but
   increasing number of randomized controlled intervention studies have
   been reported. Guidelines recommend treatment of thyroid dysfunction on
   the basis of the degree of abnormal serum TSH concentrations, patient
   age and associated comorbidities. This Review describes the current
   evidence on the prevalence, diagnosis, management and long-term
   consequences of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly.

TI Noncoding RNA and Polycomb recruitment
SO RNA-A PUBLICATION OF THE RNA SOCIETY
AB A plethora of noncoding (nc) RNAs has been revealed through the
   application of high-throughput analysis of the transcriptome, and this
   has led to an intensive search for possible biological functions
   attributable to these transcripts. A major category of functional ncRNAs
   that has emerged is for those that are implicated in coordinate gene
   silencing, either in cis or in trans. The archetype for this class is
   the well-studied long ncRNA Xist which functions in cis to bring about
   transcriptional silencing of an entire X chromosome in female mammals.
   An important step in X chromosome inactivation is the recruitment of the
   Polycomb repressive complex PRC2 that mediates histone H3 lysine 27
   methylation, a hallmark of the inactive X chromosome, and recent studies
   have suggested that this occurs as a consequence of PRC2 interacting
   directly with Xist RNA. Accordingly, other ncRNAs have been linked to
   PRC2 targeting either in cis or in trans, and here also the mechanism
   has been proposed to involve direct interaction between PRC2 proteins
   and the different ncRNAs. In this review, I discuss the evidence for and
   against this hypothesis, in the process highlighting alternative models
   and discussing experiments that, in the future, will help to resolve
   existing discrepancies.

TI Creb1-Mecp2-(m)CpG Complex Transactivates Postnatal Murine Neuronal
   Glucose Transporter Isoform 3 Expression
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The murine neuronal facilitative glucose transporter isoform 3 (Glut3)
   is developmentally regulated, peaking in expression at postnatal day
   (PN)14. In the present study, we characterized a canonical CpG island
   spanning the 5'-flanking region of the glut3 gene. Methylation-specific
   PCR and bisulfite sequencing identified methylation of this CpG ((m)CpG)
   island of the glut3 gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold
   with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA methyl transferase 3a concentrations
   noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of
   glut3-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal
   neurons demonstrated that (m)CpGs inhibit glut3 transcription. Contrary
   to this biological function, glut3 expression rises synchronously with
   (m)CpGs in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP)
   revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the
   glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific co-regulators,
   Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a
   downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to
   bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone
   deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1
   associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells
   enhanced glut3 transcription. Separate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
   pretreatment or in combination with trichostatin A reduced (m)CpG and
   specific small interference RNAs targeting Mecp2 and Creb1 separately or
   together depleting Mecp2 and/or Creb1 binding of glut3-(m)CpGs reduced
   glut3 expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that Glut3 is a
   methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits Mecp2. Recruitment of
   Creb1-Mecp2 by glut3-(m)CpG contributes towards transactivation,
   formulating an escape from (m)CpG-induced gene suppression, and thereby
   promoting developmental neuronal glut3 gene transcription and
   expression. (Endocrinology 154: 1598-1611, 2013)

TI An evaluation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in the Amphibian
   Metamorphosis Assay and the Fish Short-Term Reproduction Assay
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was evaluated in both the
   Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (AMA) and the Fish Short Term Reproduction
   Assay (FSTRA). In the AMA, tadpoles were exposed to mean measured 2,4-D
   concentrations of 0 (water control), 0.273, 3.24, 38.0 and 113 mg acid
   equivalents (ae)/L for either seven or 21 days. In the FSTRA, fathead
   minnows were exposed to mean measured 2,4-D concentrations of 0 (water
   control), 0.245, 3.14, 34.0, and 96.5 mg ae/L for 21 days. The
   respective concentrations of 2,4-D were not overtly toxic to either
   Xenopus laevis tadpoles or fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). In the
   AMA, there were no signs of either advanced or delayed development,
   asynchronous development, or significant histopathological effects of
   the thyroid gland among 2,4-D exposed tadpoles evaluated on either day
   seven or day 21 of the exposure. Therefore, following the AMA decision
   logic, 2,4-D is considered "likely thyroid inactive" in the AMA with a
   No Observable Effect Concentration (NOEC) of 113 mg ae 2,4-D/L. In the
   FSTRA, there were no significant differences between control and 2,4-D
   exposed fish in regard to fertility, wet weight, length, gonadosomatic
   indices, tubercle scores, or blood plasma concentrations of
   vitellogenin. Furthermore, there were no treatment-related
   histopathologic changes in the testes or ovaries in any 2,4-D exposed
   group. The only significant effect was a decrease in fecundity among
   fish exposed to 96.5 mg ae 2,4-D/L The cause of the reduced fecundity at
   the highest concentration of 2,4-D tested in the assay was most likely
   due to a generalized stress response in the fish, and not due to a
   specific endocrine mode of action of 2,4-D. Based on fish reproduction,
   the NOEC in the FSTRA was 34.0 mg ae 2,4-D/L (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

TI MicroRNA-137 promoter methylation in oral lichen planus and oral
   squamous cell carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF ORAL PATHOLOGY & MEDICINE
AB Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common oral mucosal disease, which is
   generally considered a potentially malignant lesion. To identify
   efficiently prognostic biomarker, we investigated the microRNA-137
   (miR-137) promoter methylation in OLP and compared with the samples from
   healthy volunteers and patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma
   (OSCC). A total of 20 OLP and 12 patients with OSCC as well as 10
   healthy subjects were subjected to miR-137 promoter methylation analysis
   using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). To address the malignancy
   prediction potential from miR-137 promoter methylation status,
   methylation of the p16 gene, a well-known tumor suppressor, was
   investigated in the same samples. The p16 methylation and miR-137
   promoter methylation were found to be 25% and 35% in patients with OLP,
   50% and 58.3% in patients with OSCC, and 0% and 0% in healthy subjects,
   respectively. The differences between miR-137 and p16 methylation levels
   were statistically significant between healthy controls and patients.
   Methylation levels of the two promoters were also influenced by age,
   gender, and lesion duration. Interestingly, aberrant promoter
   methylation of the p16 and miR-137 genes was only found in the
   epithelium but not in the connective tissue from patients with OLP. This
   raises the possibility to use miR-137 methylation as a biomarker for
   malignant prediction in patients with OLP.

TI Characterization of genome methylation patterns in the desert locust
   Schistocerca gregaria
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB DNA methylation is a widely conserved epigenetic modification. The
   analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation patterns in various organisms
   suggests that major features of animal methylomes are widely conserved.
   However, based on the variation of DNA methyltransferase genes in
   invertebrates, it has also been proposed that DNA methylation could
   provide a molecular mechanism for ecological adaptation. We have now
   analyzed the methylome of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria,
   which represents an organism with a high degree of phenotypic
   plasticity. Using genome-scale bisulfite sequencing, we show here that
   the S. gregaria methylome is characterized by CpG- and exon-specific
   methylation and thus shares two major features with other animal
   methylomes. In contrast to other invertebrates, however, overall
   methylation levels were substantially higher and a significant fraction
   of transposons was methylated. Additionally, genic sequences were
   densely methylated in a pronounced bimodal pattern, suggesting a role
   for DNA methylation in the regulation of locust gene expression. Our
   results thus uncover a unique pattern of genome methylation in locusts
   and provide an important foundation for investigating the role of DNA
   methylation in locust phase polyphenism.

TI CHH islands: de novo DNA methylation in near-gene chromatin regulation
   in maize
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Small RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin structure is an important
   means of suppressing unwanted genetic activity in diverse plants, fungi,
   and animals. In plants specifically, 24-nt siRNAs direct de novo
   methylation to repetitive DNA, both foreign and endogenous, in a process
   known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Many components of the de
   novo methylation machinery have been identified recently, including
   multiple RNA polymerases, but specific genetic features that trigger
   methylation remain poorly understood. By applying whole-genome bisulfite
   sequencing to maize, we found that transposons close to cellular genes
   (particularly within 1 kb of either a gene start or end) are strongly
   associated with de novo methylation, as evidenced both by 24-nt siRNAs
   and by methylation specifically in the CHH sequence context. In
   addition, we found that the major classes of transposons exhibited a
   gradient of CHH methylation determined by proximity to genes. Our
   results further indicate that intergenic chromatin in maize exists in
   two major forms that are distinguished based on proximity to genes-one
   form marked by dense CG and CHG methylation and lack of transcription,
   and one marked by CHH methylation and activity of multiple forms of RNA
   polymerase. The existence of the latter, which we call CHH islands, may
   have implications for how cellular gene expression could be coordinated
   with immediately adjacent transposon repression in a large genome with a
   complex organization of genes interspersed in a landscape of
   transposons.

TI Chromatin structure outside and inside the nucleus
SO BIOPOLYMERS
AB The structure of the 30-nm chromatin fiber has provided, over the years,
   an important reference in chromatin studies. Originally derived from
   electron microscopic studies of soluble chromatin fibers released by
   restriction digestion, the gross structural features of such fragments
   have been supported by biophysical methods such as low angle X-ray and
   neutron scattering, sedimentation, light scattering, and electric
   dichroism. Electron microscopy and sedimentation velocity measurements
   demonstrated that reconstituted chromatin fibers, prepared from
   repeating arrays of high affinity nucleosome positioning sequences,
   retain the same overall features as observed for native chromatin
   fibers. It had been suggested that the 30 nm fiber might be the form
   assumed in vivo by transcriptionally silent chromatin, but individual
   gene or genome-wide studies of chromatin released from nuclei do not
   reveal any such simple correlation. Furthermore, even though the 30 nm
   fiber has been thought to represent an intermediate in the hierarchical
   folding of DNA into chromosomes, most analyses of chromatin folding
   within the nucleus do not detect any regular extended compact
   structures. However, there are important exceptions in chicken erythroid
   cell nuclei as well as in transcribed regions that form extended loops.
   Localized domains within the nucleus, either at the surface of
   chromosome domains or constrained as a specialized kind of constitutive
   heterochromatin by specific DNA binding proteins, may adopt 30 nm
   fiber-like structures. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 99:

TI Evidence of a conserved functional role for DNA methylation in termites
SO INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Many organisms are capable of developing distinct phenotypes from the
   same genotype. This developmental plasticity is particularly prevalent
   in insects, which can produce alternate adaptive forms in response to
   distinct environmental cues. The ability to develop divergent phenotypes
   from the same genotype often relies on epigenetic information, which
   affects gene function and is transmitted through cell divisions. One of
   the most important epigenetic marks, DNA methylation, has been lost in
   several insect lineages, yet its taxonomic distribution and functional
   conservation remain uninvestigated in many taxa. In the present study,
   we demonstrate that the signature of high levels of DNA methylation
   exists in the expressed genes of two termites, Reticulitermes flavipes
   and Coptotermes formosanus. Further, we show that DNA methylation is
   preferentially targeted to genes with ubiquitous expression among
   morphs. Functional associations of DNA methylation are also similar to
   those observed in other invertebrate taxa with functional DNA
   methylation systems. Finally, we demonstrate an association between DNA
   methylation and the long-term evolutionary conservation of genes.
   Overall, our findings strongly suggest DNA methylation is present at
   particularly high levels in termites and may play similar roles to those
   found in other insects.

TI Effects of promoter methylation on increased expression of polyamine
   biosynthetic genes in suicide
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The polyamine
   system has been increasingly implicated in the neurobiology of suicide.
   Previous research has indicated that epigenetic mechanisms play a role
   in explaining dysregulation of polyamine genes in suicide completers.
   Nevertheless, regulatory mechanisms explaining polyamine biosynthetic
   genes displaying dysregulated expression in suicide completers,
   including ornithine decarboxylase antizymes I and 2 (OAZ1 and OAZ2),
   S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1), and arginase 2 (ARG2), have
   yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated methylation
   patterns in the promoter region of OAZ1, OAZ2, AMD1, and ARG2 in
   Brodmann area 44 from a group of 33 suicide completers and 31
   non-suicide controls. We found significant site-specific differences in
   methylation in the promoter of ARG2 and AMD1 that were also
   significantly negatively correlated with gene expression. These findings
   provide further support for a role for the involvement of epigenetic
   modifications in the regulation of genes associated with polyamine
   biosynthesis, and which may contribute to the complexity of suicidal

   melting curve analyses. These data were further complemented by FISH,
   chromosome banding, array CGH, and CDKN2B promoter methylation analyses.
   NOTCH1 was the most frequently mutated gene with a 71.1% frequency
   followed by FBXW7 (18.9%), PHF6 (39.5%), DNMT3A (17.8%), RUNX1 (15.5%),
   PTEN (10.0%), CDKN2A (4.4%), FLT3-ITD (2.2%), and FLT3-TKD (1.1%). In
   total, 84/90 (93.3%) cases harbored at least one mutation. Combining
   these data with CDKN2A/B deletions and CDKN2B methylation status, we
   detected minimum one aberration in 89/90 (98.9%) patients. Survival
   analyses revealed the subtype as defined by the immunophenotype as the
   strongest independent prognostic factor. When restricting the survival
   analysis to the early T-ALL subtype, a strong association of RUNX1 (P =
   0.027) and DNMT3A (P = 0.005) mutations with shorter overall survival
   was observed. In conclusion, RUNX1 and DNMT3A are frequently mutated in
   T-ALL and are associated with poor prognosis in early T-ALL. (c) 2013

TI Genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation and DNA demethylation and
   related chromatin regulators in cancer
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-REVIEWS ON CANCER
AB DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene
   expression, as it is the first epigenetic modification to take place on
   a given DNA strand. Several factors may directly or indirectly regulate
   the dynamic distribution of DNA methylation and demethylation between
   intergenic and intragenic gene regions, thereby controlling gene
   expression. CpG islands have direct implications for the understanding
   of DNA methylation patterns in normal conditions and in some common
   disease states, including cancer. Here, we summarize several recent
   studies on the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation and
   demethylation and their related factors, and we discuss the potential of
   DNA methylation and demethylation patterns to contribute to gene
   transcription patterns in tumorigenesis. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

TI Epigenetic changes and transposon reactivation in Thai rice hybrids
SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
AB Inter- or intraspecific hybridization is the first step in transferring
   exogenous traits to the germplasm of a recipient crop. One of the
   complicating factors is the occurrence of epigenetic modifications of
   the hybrids, which in turn can change their gene expression and
   phenotype. In this study we present an analysis of epigenome changes in
   rice hybrids that were obtained by crossing rice cultivars, most of them
   of indica type and Thai origin. Comparing amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints of twenty-four cultivars, we calculated
   Nei's indexes for measuring genetic relationships. Epigenetic changes in
   their hybrids were established using methylation-sensitive AFLP
   fingerprinting and transposon display of the rice transposable elements
   (TEs) Stowaway Os-1 and Mashu, leading to the question whether the
   relationship between parental genomes is a predictor of epigenome
   changes, TE reactivation and changes in TE methylation. Our study now
   reveals that the genetic relationship between the parents and DNA
   methylation changes in their hybrids is not significantly correlated.
   Moreover, genetic distance correlates only weakly with Mashu
   reactivation, whereas it does not correlate with Stowaway Os-1
   reactivation. Our observations also suggest that epigenome changes in
   the hybrids are localized events affecting specific chromosomal regions
   and transposons rather than affecting the genomic methylation landscape
   as a whole. The weak correlation between genetic distance and Mashu
   methylation and reactivation points at only limited influence of genetic
   background on the epigenetic status of the transposon. Our study further
   demonstrates that hybridizations between and among specific japonica and
   indica cultivars induce both genomic DNA methylation and
   reactivation/methylation change in the Stowaway Os-1 and Mashu
   transposons. The observed epigenetic changes seem to affect the
   transposons in a clear manner, partly driven by stochastic processes,
   which may account for a broader phenotypic plasticity of the hybrids. A
   better understanding of the epigenome changes leading to such transposon
   activation can lead to the development of novel tools for more
   variability in future rice breeding.

TI Class I HDAC inhibition blocks cocaine-induced plasticity by targeted
   changes in histone methylation
SO NATURE NEUROSCIENCE
AB Induction of histone acetylation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key
   brain reward region, promotes cocaine-induced alterations in gene
   expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) tightly regulate the
   acetylation of histone tails, but little is known about the functional
   specificity of different HDAC isoforms in the development and
   maintenance of cocaine-induced plasticity, and previous studies of HDAC
   inhibitors report conflicting effects on cocaine-elicited behavioral
   adaptations. Here we demonstrate that specific and prolonged blockade of
   HDAC1 in NAc of mice increased global levels of histone acetylation, but
   also induced repressive histone methylation and antagonized
   cocaine-induced changes in behavior, an effect mediated in part through
   a chromatin-mediated suppression of GABA(A) receptor subunit expression
   and inhibitory tone on NAc neurons. Our findings suggest a new mechanism
   by which prolonged and selective HDAC inhibition can alter behavioral
   and molecular adaptations to cocaine and inform the development of
   therapeutics for cocaine addiction.

TI Involvement of DNA methylation in the regulation of STS10 gene
   expression in Vitis amurensis
SO PLANTA
AB DNA methylation is known to play an important role in various
   developmental processes and defense mechanisms in plants and other
   organisms. However, it is not known whether DNA methylation is
   implicated in the genetic regulation of plant secondary metabolism,
   including resveratrol biosynthesis. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring
   polyphenol that is present in grapes, peanuts, and other plant sources,
   and it exhibits a wide range of valuable biologically active properties.
   The transformation of the wild-growing grape Vitis amurensis with the
   oncogene rolB from Agrobacterium rhizogenes has been demonstrated to
   considerably increase resveratrol production. To investigate whether DNA
   methylation regulates resveratrol biosynthesis, we treated both rolB
   transgenic and empty vector control V. amurensis cell cultures with the
   DNA demethylation agent 5-azacytosine (azaC). The azaC treatment
   significantly increased stilbene synthase 10 gene (VaSTS10) expression
   and resveratrol content in the V. amurensis cell cultures. Using
   bisulfite sequencing, we examined the methylation status of VaSTS10 in
   cell cultures under normal conditions and after azaC treatment. Both the
   promoter and 3'-end of the protein coding region of the VaSTS10 gene
   were hypermethylated (54-67 %) in the control cell culture. The rolB
   transgenic cell culture had high levels of resveratrol and lower
   hypermethylation levels of the VaSTS10 gene (20-47 %). The azaC
   treatment resulted in reduction in the DNA methylation levels in the
   promoter and coding regions of the VaSTS10 gene in both cell cultures.
   These data suggest that the DNA methylation may be involved in the
   control of resveratrol biosynthesis via the regulation of STS genes
   expression.

TI High-resolution DNA methylome analysis of primordial germ cells
   identifies gender-specific reprogramming in mice
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Dynamic epigenetic reprogramming occurs during mammalian germ cell
   development, although the targets of this process, including DNA
   demethylation and de novo methylation, remain poorly understood. We
   performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in male and female mouse
   primordial germ cells at embryonic days 10.5, 13.5, and 16.5 by
   whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing. Our high-resolution DNA
   methylome maps demonstrated gender-specific differences in CpG
   methylation at genome-wide and gene-specific levels during fetal
   germline progression. There was extensive intra- and intergenic
   hypomethylation with erasure of methylation marks at imprinted,
   X-linked, or germline-specific genes during gonadal sex determination
   and partial methylation at particular retrotransposons. Following global
   demethylation and sex determination, CpG sites switched to de novo
   methylation in males, but the X-linked genes appeared resistant to the
   wave of de novo methylation. Significant differential methylation at a
   subset of imprinted loci was identified in both genders, and non-CpG
   methylation occurred only in male gonocytes. Our data establish the
   basis for future studies on the role of epigenetic modifications in
   germline development and other biological processes.

TI Corticosterone and stable isotopes in feathers predict egg size in

SO IBIS
AB Examining factors that operate outside the breeding season may provide
   new insights into life-history traits such as egg size, in which
   individual variation has not been fully explained. We measured
   corticosterone (CORT) levels and 15N values (trophic level) in feathers
   grown several months before egg-laying to test the prediction that a
   female's physiological state and feeding behaviour prior to the breeding
   season can influence egg mass in Atlantic Puffins Fratercula arctica. As
   predicted, egg mass increased with both CORT and 15N values in feathers,
   suggesting that the ability of female Puffins to meet the nutritional
   costs of egg production is related to CORT promoting increased foraging
   effort during moult and to consumption of a higher trophic-level diet.

TI Dietary Selenomethionine Exposure Induces Physical Malformations and
   Decreases Growth and Survival to Metamorphosis in an Amphibian (Hyla
   chrysoscelis)
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient with a narrow therapeutic
   concentration range. The relative toxicity of Se increases as it is
   biotransformed into organic compounds, primarily selenomethionine
   (SeMet), within the aquatic food chain. Effects of aquatic Se
   contamination are well quantified for many freshwater fish and aquatic
   bird species, but impacts on amphibians are not well known. This study
   investigated the responses of larval Cope's gray tree frogs (Hyla
   chrysoscelis) fed a diet enriched with one of two concentrations of
   SeMet (50.1 and 489.9 mu g Se g(-1) dw [low and high groups,
   respectively]) by way of a food-limited (ration) or ad libitum (ad lib)
   feeding regimen. The high dose caused 100 % mortality during the larval
   period independent of resource provision levels. Regardless of feeding
   regimen, the low dose decreased larval survival and successful
   metamorphosis relative to control treatments. The low dose also induced
   rear limb deformities in a parts per thousand currency sign73 % of
   individuals initiating metamorphosis. Providing low-dose food by way of
   a rationed feeding regimen decreased observed toxicity, likely because
   of decreased dietary exposure to SeMet relative to the low ad lib
   treatment. Individuals from the low ration treatment had decreased wet
   mass at initiation and completion of metamorphic climax (Gosner stages
   42 through 46) compared with those from the control ad lib treatment,
   indicating that resource limitation combined with Se exposure might
   negatively affect energy stores after metamorphosis. However, lipid
   content analyses of recently metamorphosed individuals did not reveal
   any influence of treatment or resource provision on energy stored as
   lipids. The mean tissue Se concentration of individuals that received
   the low dose and completed metamorphosis was significantly greater than
   that of control ad lib or ration individuals at the same developmental
   stage. This study demonstrates that larval exposure to dietary SeMet can
   decrease growth and survival and induce deformities in a developing
   amphibian. Furthermore, retention of Se body burdens through
   metamorphosis suggests that surviving individuals can transport Se
   accumulated from contaminated aquatic environments into terrestrial food
   webs.

TI New advances of DNA methylation and histone modifications in rheumatoid
   arthritis, with special emphasis on MeCP2
SO CELLULAR SIGNALLING
AB Epigenetics is a steadily growing research area in many human diseases,
   especially in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA
   is an autoimmune disease with unclear etiology characterized by chronic
   inflammation and joint destruction and fibroblast-like synoviocytes
   (FLS) display a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA. Even though the
   etiology is not yet fully understood, RA is generally considered to be
   caused by a combination of epigenetic modification, deregulated
   immunomodulation, and environmental factors. Epigenetic modifications,
   including DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications,
   such as histone methylation and histone (de)acetylation are identified
   as regulatory mechanisms in controlling aggressive FLS activation in
   patients and animal models. In the last 3 years, the field of
   epigenetics in RA has impressively increased. Methyl-CpG-binding protein
   2 (MeCP2) is first identified as a transcriptional repressor that
   inhibits gene expression through the interpretation of two epigenetic
   markers, DNA methylation and histone modification. The cooperative
   action among MeCP2, DNA methylation and histone modifications indicates
   that MeCP2 should participate in the pathogenesis of RA through silence
   of certain gene transcription. In this review, we consider the role of
   DNA methylation and histone modifications in the development of RA, with
   a special focus on increased MeCP2 expression in RA animal models. (C)

   RNA-sequencing analysis of high glucose-treated monocytes reveals novel
   transcriptome signatures and associated epigenetic profiles. Physiol
   Genomics 45: 287-299, 2013. First published February 5, 2013;
   doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00001.2013.-We performed high throughput
   transcriptomic profiling with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to uncover
   network responses in human THP-1 monocytes treated with high glucose
   (HG). Our data analyses revealed that interferon (IFN) signaling,
   pattern recognition receptors, and activated interferon regulatory
   factors (IRFs) were enriched among the HG-upregulated genes. Motif
   analysis identified an HG-responsive IRF-mediated network in which
   interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were enriched. Notably, this network
   showed strong overlap with a recently discovered IRF7-driven network
   relevant to Type 1 diabetes. We next examined if the HG-regulated genes
   possessed any characteristic chromatin features in the basal state by
   profiling 15 active and repressive chromatin marks under normal glucose
   conditions using chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to promoter
   microarrays. Composite profiles revealed higher histone H3
   lysine-9-acetylation levels around the promoters of HG-upregulated genes
   compared with all RefSeq promoters. Interestingly, within the
   HG-upregulated genes, active chromatin marks were enriched not only at
   high CpG content promoters, but surprisingly also at low CpG content
   promoters. Similar results were obtained with peripheral blood monocytes
   exposed to HG. These new results reveal a novel mechanism by which HG
   can exercise IFN-alpha-like effects in monocytes by upregulating a set
   of ISGs poised for activation with multiple chromatin marks.

TI Genetic determinants of haemolysis in sickle cell anaemia
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY
AB Haemolytic anaemia is variable among patients with sickle cell anaemia
   and can be estimated by reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase,
   aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin levels. Using principal
   component analysis of these measurements we computed a haemolytic score
   that we used as a subphenotype in a genome-wide association study. We
   identified in one cohort and replicated in two additional cohorts the
   association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in NPRL3 (rs7203560;
   chr16p13 center dot 3) (P=6 center dot 04x1007). This association was
   validated by targeted genotyping in a fourth independent cohort. The
   HBA1/HBA2 regulatory elements, hypersensitive sites (HS)-33, HS-40 and
   HS-48 are located in introns of NPRL3. Rs7203560 was in perfect linkage
   disequilibrium (LD) with rs9926112 (r2=1) and in strong LD with
   rs7197554 (r2=0 center dot 75) and rs13336641 (r2=0 center dot 77); the
   latter is located between HS-33 and HS-40 sites and next to a CTCF
   binding site. The minor allele for rs7203560 was associated with the 3
   center dot 7thalassaemia gene deletion. When adjusting for HbF and
   thalassaemia, the association of NPRL3 with the haemolytic score was
   significant (P=0 center dot 00375) and remained significant when
   examining only cases without gene deletion thalassaemia (P=0 center dot
   02463). Perhaps by independently down-regulating expression of the
   HBA1/HBA2 genes, variants of the HBA1/HBA2 gene regulatory loci, tagged
   by rs7203560, reduce haemolysis in sickle cell anaemia.

TI DNA methylation associated with polycomb repression in retinoic acid
   receptor beta silencing
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB Retinoic acid receptor beta 2 (RAR beta 2) is a tumor suppressor gene
   whose loss of expression is recurrent in prostate cancers. Here we
   studied the epigenetic mechanisms leading to its stable silencing.
   First, we characterized all RAR beta isoforms in 6 human tumor cell
   lines (prostate DU145, LNCaP, PC3, lung A549, breast Hs578T, and colon
   HCT116) by RT-PCR and Western blot. We excluded loss of heterozygosity
   (2D-FISH) and loss of RARa expression, an upstream regulator, as origin
   of RAR beta 2 silencing. All data concluded to an epigenetic silencing.
   In agreement, a DNA methylation inhibitor restored its expression.
   Second RAR beta 2 loss of expression was found associated with different
   epigenetic profiles in LNCaP and DU145 cells. According to bisulfite
   sequencing and ChIP analysis, we observed heavy methylation (97%) of the
   RAR beta 2 promoter with repressive histone mark H3K9me3 in LNCaP. While
   DNA methylation and polycomb repression are described to be mutually
   exclusive at CpG-rich promoters, we observed that in DU145, moderate DNA
   methylation (36%) and H3K9me3 mark were present concomitantly with
   H3K27me3, a signature of polycomb repression. In summary, we provide new
   insights on how the RAR beta 2 promoter is silenced, reveal the
   existence of two distinct repressive chromatin profiles at the same
   locus, and support a polycomb-mediated epigenetic repression process in
   prostate cancer.-Moison, C., Senamaud-Beaufort, C., Fourriere, L.,

TI Corticosterone Suppresses the Proliferation of RAW264.7 Macrophage Cells
   via Glucocorticoid, But Not Mineralocorticoid, Receptor
SO BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Macrophages are white blood cells within tissues that are produced by
   monocytes and help to protect against infection by bacteria through
   phagocytosis. Several studies have shown a correlation between the state
   of depression and abnormalities in the immune response. Corticosterone
   (CORT), which is often referred to as the stress hormone, is a
   well-known regulator of peripheral immune responses and also shows
   anti-inflammatory properties in the body. However, it is still unclear
   how CORT regulates macrophage function. In this study, we focused on the
   effects of CORT on the proliferation and survival of macrophage cells
   using the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Under treatment with 10 mu m
   CORT for 24 h, the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells decreased to 73.6% of
   that in the control. Moreover, this inhibition was blocked by treatment
   with mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, but not by
   spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. In an
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, CORT did not show any cytotoxic
   effect on RAW264.7 cells. JC-1 cell staining also showed that CORT did
   not influence mitochondrial dysfunction in RAW264.7 cells. In an
   investigation of the modulation of a signaling cascade by CORT,
   treatment with CORT promoted the translocation of GR, but not MR, from
   the cytosol to the nucleus in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, our
   findings suggest that CORT suppresses the proliferation of RAW264.7
   cells by controlling the transcription of a particular gene, which is
   related to cell proliferation, through the formation of a CORT-GR
   complex.

TI Placentas from pregnancies conceived by IVF/ICSI have a reduced DNA
   methylation level at the H19 and MEST differentially methylated regions
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB Does IVF/ICSI have an effect on the epigenetic regulation of the human
   placenta?
   We found a reduced DNA methylation level at the H19 and MEST
   differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and an increased RNA
   expression of H19 in placentas from pregnancies conceived by IVF/ICSI
   when compared with placentas from spontaneous conception.
   Changes in fetal environment are associated with adverse health
   outcomes. The placenta is pivotal for intrauterine environment. Animal
   studies show that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in these
   environment-induced phenotypic effects. Also, the preimplantation embryo
   environment affects birthweight as well as the risk of chronic adult
   diseases. Epigenetic processes are sensitive to the environment,
   especially during the period around conception.
   Placental tissue was collected from 35 spontaneously conceived
   pregnancies and 35 IVF/ICSI (5 IVF, 30 ICSI) derived pregnancies. We
   quantitatively analysed the DNA methylation patterns of a number of
   consecutive CpGs in the core regions of DMRs and other regulatory
   regions of imprinted genes, since these are involved in placental and
   fetal growth and development.
   By using pyrosequencing, the DNA methylation at seven germline-derived
   primary DMRs was analysed quantitatively. Five of these are maternally
   methylated (MEST isoform and , PEG3, KCNQ1OT1 and SNRPN) and two are
   paternally methylated [H19 DMR and the intergenic region between DLK1
   and MEG3 (IG-DMR)]. The post-fertilization-derived secondary DMRs, IGF2
   (DMR0 and 2) and IG-DMR (CG7, also called MEG3 DMR), and the MEG3
   promoter region were examined as well. In case of differential
   methylation between the two groups, the effect on gene expression was
   assessed by quantitative real-time PCR.
   Both the promoter region of MEST isoform and and the 6th CTCF binding
   site within the H19 DMR were significantly hypomethylated in the
   IVF/ICSI group. The phenomenon was consistently observed over all CpG
   sites analysed and not restricted to single CpG sites. The other primary
   and secondary DMRs were not affected. Expression of H19 was increased in
   the IVF/ICSI group, while that of IGF2 and MEST remained similar.
   In the IVF/ICSI group, mostly ICSI pregnancies were investigated. The
   ICSI technique or male subfertility could be a confounding factor.
   Therefore, our results are less generalizable to IVF pregnancies.
   The clinical effects of the observed placental hypomethylations on the
   developmental programming of the IVF/ICSI progeny, if any, are as yet
   unknown. Whether the hypomethylation is an adaptation of the placenta to
   maintain fetal supply and ameliorate the effects of environmental cues,
   or whether it is a deregulation leading to deranged developmental
   programming with or without increased vulnerability for disease,
   consistent with the developmental origins of health and disease
   hypothesis, needs further investigation.

TI Chromatin-linked determinants of zygotic genome activation
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB The merging of the maternal and paternal genomes into a single
   pronucleus after fertilization is accompanied by a remarkable
   reconfiguration of chromatin in the newly formed zygote. The first
   stages of embryonic chromatin remodeling take place in the absence of
   ongoing transcription, during a species-specific developmental
   time-frame. Once post-fertilization chromatin states are organized,
   zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is initiated, and embryonic transcripts
   gradually take control of development. We review here transitions in
   chromatin modifications associated with the onset of ZGA, and the role
   of transcription factors and DNA motifs in the regulation of ZGA. We
   propose a model of sequential chromatin remodeling events preceding ZGA,
   leading to the onset of embryonic transcription.

TI Inversion upstream of FOXF1 in a case of lethal alveolar capillary
   dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A
AB Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins
   (ACDMPV) is a congenital malformation that leads to severe pulmonary
   hypertension and respiratory failure. It has been associated with
   deletion of, or mutation in, FOXF1 on 16q24.1, a gene encoding a
   forkhead transcription factor expressed in the mesenchyme of the
   developing lung. Here we report on the identification of a pericentric
   inversion on chromosome 16 (p11.2q24.1) in a case of lethal ACDMPV with
   atrioventricular septal defect and duodenal atresia. Array-CGH indicated
   that the inversion is balanced, and FISH showed that the q-arm
   breakpoint occurs 134 +/- 10kb upstream (5; centromeric) of FOXF1. This
   is suggestive of cis-regulatory elements located more than 130kb 5 of
   FOXF1, and analysis of genome-wide data sets of chromatin modifications
   in two different cell types suggested that the FOXF1 regulatory domain
   covers more than 300kb, and perhaps up to 433kb, upstream of the gene,
   but only 3kb downstream. The 588kb gene-free region between FOXF1 and
   the next gene in the centromeric direction, IRF8, is highly conserved
   between species and divided into two distinct regulatory domains by an
   insulator element. Another putative insulator occurs just downstream of
   FOXF1. Our results further strengthen the association between FOXF1 and
   a spectrum of malformations that include ACDMPV, atrioventricular septal
   defects, and gastrointestinal atresia. Furthermore, the presented
   analysis aids in defining the critical genomic region for this syndrome.

TI Normal colon tissue and colon carcinoma show no difference in heparanase
   promoter methylation
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
AB Introduction: Heparanase, the sole heparan sulfate degrading enzyme, has
   a role in cellular invasion. Accordingly, a large number of studies have
   demonstrated an association between heparanase expression and tumor
   stage and patients' prognosis. In colon carcinoma, heparanase shows
   increased expression in tumor compared to normal tissue and its
   expression correlates with the presence of metastasis. One of the
   regulatory mechanisms of heparanase expression is de-methylation on its
   promoter. In the present study we evaluated the role of heparanase
   promoter methylation in colon carcinoma.
   Material and methods: Analysis of heparanase promoter methylation was
   done on 32 samples of colon carcinoma as well as 30 samples of normal
   colonic mucosa. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue and subjected to
   bisulfite conversion. The relative fraction of methylated and
   unmethylated DNA was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR.
   Results: The fraction of methylated DNA was 1 +/- 3.4% in the colon
   carcinoma group, and 2.5 +/- 3.3% in the normal colon group (P = 0.11).
   Only one case in the normal group and one case in the tumor group showed
   more than 10% methylation in the heparanase promoter.
   Conclusion: We did not find any significant difference in heparanase
   promoter methylation between colon carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa,
   suggesting that heparanase overexpression in colon carcinoma is mediated
   by other mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Epigenetically induced changes in nuclear textural patterns and
   gelatinase expression in human fibrosarcoma cells
SO CELL PROLIFERATION
AB Objective Chromatin texture patterns of tumour cell nuclei can serve as
   cancer biomarkers, either to define diagnostic classifications or to
   obtain relevant prognostic information, in a large number of human
   tumours. Epigenetic mechanisms, mainly DNA methylation and histone
   post-translational modification, have been shown to influence chromatin
   packing states, and therefore nuclear texture. The aim of this study was
   to analyse effects of these two mechanisms on chromatin texture, and
   also on correlation with gelatinase expression, in human fibrosarcoma
   tumour cells. Materials and methods We investigated effects of DNA
   hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) and histone
   deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on nuclear textural
   characteristics of human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, evaluated by image
   cytometry, and expression of gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, two
   metalloproteinases implicated in cancer progression and metastasis.
   Results 5-azadC induced significant variation in chromatin higher order
   organization, particularly chromatin decondensation, associated with
   reduction in global DNA methylation, concomitantly with increase in
   MMP-9, and to a lesser extent, MMP-2 expression. TSA alone did not have
   any effect on HT1080 cells, but exhibited differential activity when
   added to cells treated with 5-azadC. When treated with both drugs,
   nuclei had higher texture abnormalities. In this setting, reduction in
   MMP-9 expression was observed, whereas MMP-2 expression remained
   unaffected. Conclusions These data show that hypomethylating drug
   5-azadC and histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA were able to induce
   modulation of higher order chromatin organization and gelatinase
   expression in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells.

TI Non-canonical functions of the DNA methylome in gene regulation
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Methylation of the cytosine base in DNA, DNA methylation, is an
   essential epigenetic mark in mammals that contributes to the regulation
   of transcription. Several advances have been made in this area in recent
   years, leading to a leap forward in our understanding of how this
   pathway contributes to gene regulation during embryonic development, and
   the functional consequences of its perturbation in human disease.
   Critical to these advances is a comprehension of the genomic
   distribution of modified cytosine bases in unprecedented detail, drawing
   attention to genomic regions beyond gene promoters. In addition, we have
   a more complete understanding of the multifactorial manner by which DNA
   methylation influences gene regulation at the molecular level, and which
   genes rely directly on the DNA methylome for their normal
   transcriptional regulation. It is becoming apparent that a major role of
   DNA modification is to act as a relatively stable, and mitotically
   heritable, template that contributes to the establishment and
   maintenance of chromatin states. In this regard, interplay is emerging
   between DNA methylation and the PcG (Polycomb group) proteins, which act
   as evolutionarily conserved mediators of cell identity. In the present
   paper we review these aspects of DNA methylation, and discuss how a
   multifunctional view of DNA modification as an integral part of
   chromatin organization is influencing our understanding of this
   epigenetic mark's contribution to transcriptional regulation.

TI Corticosterone metabolism by chicken follicle cells does not affect
   ovarian reproductive hormone synthesis in vitro
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoids affect reproductive hormone production in many species.
   In chickens, elevated plasma corticosterone down-regulates testosterone
   and progesterone concentrations in plasma, but also in egg yolk. This
   suppression could be mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary system but
   also via local inhibition of gonadal activity by glucocorticoids. As the
   latter has not been tested in birds yet, we tested if corticosterone
   directly inhibits ovarian steroid synthesis under in vitro conditions.
   We hypothesized that degradation of corticosterone by follicular cells
   impairs their ability to synthesize reproductive hormones due to either
   inhibition Of enzymes or competition for common co-factors. Therefore,
   we first established whether follicles degrade corticosterone.
   Follicular tissue was harvested from freshly euthanized laying hens and
   incubated with radiolabelled corticosterone. Radioactive metabolites
   were visualized and quantified by autoradiography. Follicles converted
   corticosterone in a time-dependent manner into metabolites with a higher
   polarity than corticosterone. The predominant metabolite co-eluted with
   20 beta-dihydrocorticosterone. Other chicken tissues mostly formed the
   same metabolite when incubated with corticosterone. In a second
   experiment, follicles were incubated with either progesterone or
   dehydroepiandrosterone. Corticosterone was added in increasing dosages
   up to 1000 ng per ml medium. Corticosterone did not inhibit the
   conversion of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone into a number of
   different metabolites, including 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone,
   androstenedione and testosterone. In conclusion, avian tissues degrade
   corticosterone mostly to 20 beta-dihydrocorticosterone and even high
   corticosterone dosages do not affect follicular hormone production under
   in vitro conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Is the additional effort of renesting linked to a hormonal change in the
   common tern?
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND
   ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB The production of and care for a replacement clutch can bear costs in
   terms of future reproduction or survival. However, renesting is quite
   common among seabirds and can contribute considerably to individual
   fitness. Prolactin and corticosterone are two hormones involved in the
   mediation of breeding behavior and, as they are linked to body condition
   or effort, it is of interest if these hormone values change during a
   second demanding breeding phase within a year. We compared baseline
   prolactin and corticosterone between the first and the renesting attempt
   in common terns (Sterna hirundo) on individual level. Therefore, in
   addition to control birds, 37 breeders were sampled during incubation of
   their first and their replacement clutch in 2008 and 2009. Blood samples
   were taken non-invasively by blood-sucking bugs. Prolactin level was
   lower during the renesting period, especially in birds which abandoned
   their clutch afterwards, whereas corticosterone did not change.
   Excluding the deserting birds, the reduced prolactin level was not
   linked to minor success, but could be related to seasonal processes. The
   control group of late laying common terns showed comparably low
   prolactin values, but increased corticosterone concentrations. Renesting
   individuals exhibited higher prolactin during incubation of their first
   clutch than non-renesting birds, probably indicating their higher
   quality. The fact that terns still have relatively high prolactin and
   low corticosterone values during renesting might confirm their higher
   quality and suggests that they are able to meet the costs of a second
   demanding breeding period without being considerably stressed.

TI Effect of maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation on global
   and gene-specific DNA methylation in the liver of the rat offspring
SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Scope Intrauterine and early-life exposure to folic acid has
   significantly increased in North America owing to folic acid
   fortification, widespread supplemental use, and periconceptional
   supplementation. We investigated the effect of maternal and postweaning
   folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation in the rat offspring.
   Methods and results Female rats were placed on a control or folic
   acid-supplemented diet during pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, pups
   from each maternal diet group were randomized to the control or
   supplemented diet for 11 weeks. At weaning, maternal folic acid
   supplementation significantly decreased global (p < 0.001) and
   site-specific DNA methylation of the Ppar-, ER-, p53, and Apc genes (p <
   0.05) in the liver. At 14 weeks of age, postweaning, but not maternal,
   folic acid supplementation significantly decreased global DNA
   methylation (p < 0.05). At 14 weeks of age, both maternal and
   postweaning folic acid supplementation significantly increased DNA
   methylation of the Ppar-, p53, and p16 genes (p < 0.05) whereas only
   postweaning FA supplementation significantly increased DNA methylation
   of the ER- and Apc genes (p < 0.05). Conclusion Our data suggest that
   maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation can significantly
   modulate global and gene-specific DNA methylation in the rat offspring.
   The functional ramifications of the observed DNA methylation changes
   need to be determined in future studies.

TI Mineralocorticoid Receptor Activation Induces Insulin Resistance Through
   c-Jun N-terminal kinases in Response to Chronic Corticosterone:
   Cognitive Implications
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB It is becoming evident that chronic exposure to glucocorticoids might
   not only result in insulin resistance or cognitive deficits, but also is
   considered as a risk factor for pathologies such as depression or
   Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, in vivo experiments using a
   non-invasive method of chronic administration of corticosterone in
   drinking water demonstrated that chronic corticosterone administration
   led to cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test and
   insulin resistance, as shown by significant increases in plasma insulin
   levels and the homeostatic model assessment index, and decreased insulin
   receptor phosphorylation. Corticosterone treatment induced an increased
   expression of stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the
   hippocampus, accompanied by decreases in glycogen synthase kinase 3,
   increases in pTau levels and increased neuronal cell death (caspase-3
   activity). All these effects were reversed by the administration of a
   JNK1 inhibitor or by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
   spironolactone. It is suggested that the mineralocorticoid receptors and
   JNK-mediated pathways are involved in the interaction of
   glucocorticoid-insulin resistance and the development of relevant
   cellular processes for Alzheimers disease

TI Aberrant methylation of LINE-I, SLIT2, MAL and IGFBP7 in non-small cell
   lung cancer
SO ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and gene hypermethylation play important
   roles in instability and carcinogenesis. Methylation in long
   interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) is a good indicator of the
   global DNA methylation level within a cell. Slit homolog 2 (SLIT2),
   myelin and lymphocyte protein gene (MAL) and insulin-like growth factor
   binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) are known to be hypermethylated in various
   malignancies. The aim of the present study was to assess the precise
   methylation levels of LINE-1, SLIT2, MAL and IGFBP7 in non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC) using a pyrosequencing assay. Methylation of all
   regions was examined in 56 primary NSCLCs using a pyrosequencing assay.
   Changes in mRNA expression levels of SLIT2, MAL and IGFBP7 were measured
   before and after treatment with a demethylating agent. Methylation of
   these genes was also examined in 9 lung cancer cell lines using RT-PCR
   and a pyrosequencing assay. Frequencies of hypomethylation of LINE-1 and
   hypermethylation of SLIT2, MAL and IGFBP7, defined by predetermined cut
   off values, were 55, 64, 46 and 54% in NSCLCs, respectively and
   exhibited tumor-specific features. The hypermethylation of all genes was
   well correlated with changes in expression. The methylation level and
   frequency of MAL were significantly higher in smokers and in patients
   without EGFR mutations. Through accurate measurement of methylation
   levels using pyrosequencing, hypomethylation of LINE-1 and
   hypermethylation of SLIT2, MAL and IGFBP7 were frequently detected in
   NSCLCs and associated with various clinical features. Analysis of the
   methylation profiles of these genes may, therefore, provide novel
   opportunities for the therapy of NSCLCs.

TI Thyroid involvement in ankylosing spondylitis and relationship of
   thyroid dysfunction with anti-TNF alpha treatment
SO RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Association between rheumatological and autoimmune thyroid disorders has
   been demonstrated by many studies. However, a few data exist indicating
   the association between thyroid disorders and ankylosing spondylitis
   (AS). In this study, the frequency of thyroid disorders in patients with
   AS and the impact of anti-TNF alpha therapy on this were investigated.
   Data of 108 patients (female/male (F/M) 27/81) were analyzed. Data on
   free T3, free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, anti-thyroid peroxidase
   antibodies (TPO), anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid ultrasound
   were assessed retrospectively. 44 (F/M 15/29) patients were receiving
   anti-TNF alpha, while 64 (F/M 12/52) were receiving other drugs
   [(sulfasalazine, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs)]. Among those not
   receiving anti-TNF alpha therapy, TPO level was high in 23 patients
   (mean TPO value 86.69 +/- A 65.28 U/ml), while it was high only in nine
   receiving anti-TNF alpha (mean TPO 36.61 +/- A 14.02 U/ml) (p < 0.05).
   Investigating the data regarding gender in both populations, autoimmune
   thyroid disease frequency was found to be lower in the patient group
   receiving anti-TNF alpha treatment. Subclinical hyperthyroidism was
   discovered in three patients (one female two male), and subclinical
   hypothyroidism in two (two male). Thyroid nodule was detected in 29
   patients. It was concluded that the frequency of thyroid autoimmune
   disease was higher in our study than that reported in the literature,
   and the frequency of thyroid disorder in patients with AS was lower in
   those receiving anti-TNF alpha compared to those not. This may arise
   from the role of TNF alpha on pathogenesis of thyroid disorders.

TI Transcription-induced chromatin association of RNA surveillance factors
   mediates facultative heterochromatin formation in fission yeast
SO GENES TO CELLS
AB Facultative heterochromatin is reversibly established and disrupted
   during differentiation, but its regulation remains mechanistically
   unclear. Here, we show that two meiotic gene loci in fission yeast, mei4
   and ssm4, comprise facultative heterochromatin that is regulated in a

   expression levels by associating with a chromodomain protein Chp1 and an

   surveillance machinery for eliminating meiotic gene transcripts, which
   involves a cis-element called the determinant of selective removal (DSR)
   and transacting factors, Mmi1 and Red1, also participates in
   heterochromatin formation at the meiotic genes, but the molecular
   mechanism underlying the process is largely unknown. By dissecting the
   mei4 gene, we identified a region that promotes DSR-dependent
   methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9). Integration of this mei4
   region together with DSR into an unrelated gene results in ectopic H3K9
   methylation. Moreover, our results suggest that transcription of these
   elements induces chromatin association of Mmi1, which, in turn, recruits
   Red1 interacting with Clr4/Suv39h H3K9 methyltransferase. Mmi1 remains
   associated in cells lacking Red1, suggesting that the recruitment of
   Red1 follows the chromatin association of Mmi1. Overall, we provide
   detailed insights into the facultative heterochromatin regulation in
   fission yeast.

TI Acute dietary zinc deficiency before conception compromises oocyte
   epigenetic programming and disrupts embryonic development
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Recent findings show that zinc is an important factor necessary for
   regulating the meiotic cell cycle and ovulation. However, the role of
   zinc in promoting oocyte quality and developmental potential is not
   known. Using an in vivo model of acute dietary zinc deficiency, we show
   that feeding a zinc deficient diet (ZDD) for 3-5 days before ovulation
   (preconception) dramatically disrupts oocyte chromatin methylation and
   preimplantation development. There was a dramatic decrease in histone
   H3K4 trimethylation and global DNA methylation in zinc deficient
   oocytes. Moreover, there was a 3-20 fold increase in transcript
   abundance of repetitive elements (lap, Line1, Sineb1, Sineb2), but a
   decrease in Gdf9, Zp3 and Figla mRNA. Only 53% and 8% of mature eggs
   reached the 2-cell stage after IVF in animals receiving a 3 and 5 days
   ZDD, respectively, while a 5 day ZDD in vivo reduced the proportion of
   2-cells to 49%. In vivo fertilized 2-cell embryos cultured in vitro
   formed fewer (38%) blastocysts compared to control embryos (74%).
   Likewise, fewer blastocyst and expanded blastocyst were collected from
   the reproductive tract of zinc deficient animals on day 3.5 of
   pregnancy. This could be due to a decrease in Igf2 and HIS mRNA in ZDD
   blastocyst. Supplementation with a methyl donor (SAM) during IVM
   restored histone H3K4me3 and doubled the IVF success rate from 17% to
   43% in oocytes from zinc deficient animals. Thus, the terminal period of
   oocyte development is extremely sensitive to perturbation in dietary
   zinc availability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Chronic adrenocorticotrophic hormone treatment alters tricyclic
   antidepressant efficacy and prefrontal monoamine tissue levels
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Several animal models are currently utilised in the investigation of
   major depressive disorder; however, each is validated by its response to
   antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Few animal models consider the notion of
   antidepressant treatment resistance. Chronic daily administration of
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticosterone can alter
   behavioural responses to antidepressants, effectively blocking
   antidepressant efficacy. Herein, we demonstrate that ACTH-(1-24) (100 mu
   g/day; 14 days) blocks the immobility-reducing 'antidepressant' effects
   of a single dose of imipramine (10 mg/kg) in the forced swim test. This
   finding was accompanied by altered monoamine tissue levels in the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) 1 h after exposure to the acute stress of the
   forced swim test. PFC tissue from ACTH pre-treated animals contained
   significantly higher serotonin, noradrenaline and adrenaline
   concentrations relative to saline pre-treated controls. Conversely,
   dopamine levels were significantly decreased. Altered plasma
   corticosterone responses to ACTH injections were observed over the
   treatment course. Measures were taken on treatment days 1, 4, 8, 11, 14
   and 15. ACTH administration initially enhanced plasma corticosterone
   levels, however, these normalised to levels consistent with control
   animals by day 14. No differences in corticosterone levels were observed
   across the treatment time course in saline-treated animals. Taken
   together these results indicate that pre-treatment with ACTH (100 mu
   g/day; 14 days) blocks the antidepressant effects of imipramine (10
   mg/kg), significantly alters key PFC monoamine responses to stress and
   downregulates glucocorticoid responses. These results suggest that
   chronic ACTH treatment is a promising paradigm for elucidation of
   mechanisms mediating antidepressant treatment resistance. (C) 2012

   methylation is correlated with gene expression during early pregnancy in
   Bos taurus. Physiol Genomics 45: 276-286, 2013. First published February
   5, 2013; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00145.2012.-Coordinated regulation
   of endometrial gene expression is essential for successful pregnancy
   establishment. A nonreceptive uterine environment may be a key
   contributor to pregnancy loss, as the majority of pregnancy losses occur
   prior to embryo implantation. DNA methylation has been highlighted as a
   potential contributor in regulating early pregnancy events in the
   uterus. It was hypothesized that DNA methylation regulates expression of
   key genes in the uterus during pregnancy. The correlation between DNA
   methylation and gene expression was tested. Endometrial samples from
   fertile and subfertile dairy cow strains were obtained at day 17 of
   pregnancy or the reproductive cycle. Microarrays were used to
   characterize genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and data compared with
   previously published transcription profiles. 39% of DNA methylation
   probes assayed mapped to RefSeq genes with transcription measurements.
   Correlations among gene expression and DNA methylation were assessed,
   and the 1,000 most significant correlations used for subsequent
   analysis. Of these, 52% percent were negatively correlated with gene
   expression. When this gene list was compared with previously reported
   gene expression studies on the same tissues, 42% were differentially
   expressed when pregnant and cycling animals were compared, and 11% were
   differentially expressed when pregnant fertile and subfertile animals
   were compared. DNA methylation status was correlated with gene
   expression in several pathways implicated in early pregnancy events.
   Although these data do not provide direct evidence of a causative
   association between DNA methylation and gene expression, this study
   provides critical support for an effect of DNA methylation in early
   pregnancy events and highlights candidate genes for future studies.

TI Gene body methylation shows distinct patterns associated with different
   gene origins and duplication modes and has a heterogeneous relationship
   with gene expression in Oryza sativa (rice)
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Whole-genome duplication (WGD) has been recurring and single-gene
   duplication is also widespread in angiosperms. Recent whole-genome DNA
   methylation maps indicate that gene body methylation (i.e. of coding
   regions) has a functional role. However, whether gene body methylation
   is related to gene origins and duplication modes has yet to be reported.
   In rice (Oryza sativa), we computed a body methylation level (proportion
   of methylated CpG within coding regions) for each gene in five tissues.
   Body methylation levels follow a bimodal distribution, but show distinct
   patterns associated with transposable element-related genes; WGD,
   tandem, proximal and transposed duplicates; and singleton genes. For
   pairs of duplicated genes, divergence in body methylation levels
   increases with physical distance and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates,
   and WGDs show lower divergence than single-gene duplications of similar
   Ks levels. Intermediate body methylation tends to be associated with
   high levels of gene expression, whereas heavy body methylation is
   associated with lower levels of gene expression. The biological trends
   revealed here are consistent across five rice tissues, indicating that
   genes of different origins and duplication modes have distinct body
   methylation patterns, and body methylation has a heterogeneous
   relationship with gene expression and may be related to survivorship of
   duplicated genes.

TI The n-SET Domain of Set1 Regulates H2B Ubiquitylation-Dependent H3K4
   Methylation
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Past studies have documented a crosstalk between H2B ubiquitylation
   (H2Bub) and H3K4 methylation, but little (if any) direct evidence exists
   explaining the mechanism underlying H2Bub-dependent H3K4 methylation on
   chromatin templates. Here, we took advantage of an in vitro histone
   methyltransferase assay employing a reconstituted yeast Set1 complex
   (ySet1C) and a recombinant chromatin template containing fully
   ubiquitylated H2B to gain valuable insights. Combined with genetic
   analyses, we demonstrate that the n-SET domain within Set1, but not
   Swd2, is essential for H2Bub-dependent H3K4 methylation. Spp1, a homolog
   of human CFP1, is conditionally involved in this crosstalk. Our findings
   extend to the human Set1 complex, underscoring the conserved nature of
   this disease-relevant crosstalk pathway. As not all members of the H3K4
   methyltransferase family contain n-SET domains, our studies draw
   attention to the n-SET domain as a predictor of an H2B
   ubiquitylation-sensing mechanism that leads to downstream H3K4
   methylation.

TI ASH2L Regulates Ubiquitylation Signaling to MLL: trans-Regulation of H3
   K4 Methylation in Higher Eukaryotes
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Crosstalk between H2B ubiquitylation (H2Bub) and H3 K4 methylation plays
   important roles in coordinating functions of diverse cofactors during
   transcription activation. The underlying mechanism for this trans-tail
   signaling pathway is poorly defined in higher eukaryotes. Here, we show
   the following: (1) ASH2L in the MLL complex is essential for
   H2Bub-dependent H3 K4 methylation. Deleting or mutating K99 of the
   N-terminal winged helix (WH) motif in ASH2L abrogates H2Bub-dependent
   regulation. (2) Crosstalk can occur in trans and does not require
   ubiquitin to be on nucleosomes or histones to exert regulatory effects.
   (3) trans-regulation by ubiquitin promotes MLL activity for all three
   methylation states. (4) MLL3, an MLL homolog, does not respond to H2Bub,
   highlighting regulatory specificity for MLL family histone
   methyltransferases. Altogether, our results potentially expand the
   classic histone crosstalk to nonhistone proteins, which broadens the
   scope of chromatin regulation by ubiquitylation signaling.

TI Mitotic phosphorylation of MPP8 by cyclin-dependent kinases regulates
   chromatin dissociation
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Repressive epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation at CpG sites and
   histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, are enriched in heterochromatin,
   which undergoes drastic changes in structure during mitosis. MPP8 (M
   phase phosphoprotein 8) has been proposed to regulate positive
   association between these two repressive modifications, but actual
   involvement of this protein in changes in the heterochromatin structure
   during mitosis remains elusive. We demonstrate here that MPP8
   predominantly localized to, but dissociated from, chromatin during
   interphase and early mitosis, respectively. Chromatin dissociation from
   MPP8 appeared to correlate with the phosphorylation status of MPP8.
   Experiments using inhibitors of various mitotic kinases demonstrated
   that the chromatin dissociation of MPP8 during metaphase to anaphase was
   specifically regulated by cyclin B1-Cdk1. Indeed, cyclin B1 -Cdkl
   effectively phosphorylated MPP8 in vitro and on STA mutant of MPP8 (all
   possible sites phosphorylated by Cdk were substituted by alanine) failed
   to dissociate from chromatin during early mitosis. Taken together, our
   results indicate that the chromatin association of MPP8 is regulated by
   Cdk-dependent phosphorylation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Methylation of Histone H3 on Lysine 4 by the Lysine Methyltransferase
   SET1 Protein Is Needed for Normal Clock Gene Expression
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The circadian oscillator controls time-of-day gene expression by a
   network of interconnected feedback loops and is reset by light. The
   requisite for chromatin regulation in eukaryotic transcription
   necessitates temporal regulation of histone-modifying and
   chromatin-remodeling enzymes for proper clock function. CHD1is known to
   bindH3K4me3in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for
   proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. Based on this, we
   examined a strain lacking SET1 to determine the role of H3K4 methylation
   in clock-and lightmediated frq regulation. Expression of frq was altered
   in strains lacking set1 under both circadian- and light-regulated gene
   expression. There is a delay in the phasing of H3K4me3 relative to the
   peak in frq expression. White Collar 2 (WC-2) association with the frq
   promoter persists longer in Delta set1, suggesting a more permissible
   chromatin state. Surprisingly, SET1 is required for DNA methylation in
   the frq promoter, indicating a dependence on H3K4me for DNA methylation.
   The data support a model where SET1 is needed for proper regulation by
   modulating chromatin at frq.

TI Cancer detection by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 methylation
   in pancreatobiliary fluids
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: To evaluate the utility of measuring epigenetic alterations in
   pancreatic and biliary fluids in determining molecular markers for
   pancreatobiliary cancers.
   METHODS: DNA was extracted from undiluted pancreatic and biliary fluids.
   As a surrogate for a genome-wide hypomethylation assay, levels of long
   interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation were analyzed using
   bisulfite pyrosequencing. CpG island hypermethylation of 10
   tumor-associated genes, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor, adenomatous
   polyposis coli, calcium channel, voltage dependent, T type alpha 1G
   subunit, insulin-like growth factor 2, O-6-methyl-guanine-DNA
   methyltransferase, neurogenin 1, CDKN2A, runt-related transcription
   factor 3 (RUNX3), secreted frizzled-related protein 1, and ubiquitin
   carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), was analyzed using MethyLight. To
   examine the role of CpG methylation and histone deacetylation in the
   silencing of UCHL1, human gallbladder carcinoma cell lines and
   pancreatic carcinoma cell lines were treated with 2 or 5 mu mol/L
   5-AZA-dC for 72 h or 100 nmol/L Trichostatin A for 24 h. After the
   treatment, UCHL1 expression was analyzed by real-time reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
   RESULTS: Pancreatobiliary cancers exhibited significantly lower LINE-1
   methylation levels in pancreatic and biliary fluids than did
   noncancerous pancreatobiliary disease (58.7% +/- 4.3% vs 61.7% +/- 2.2%,
   P = 0.027; 53.8% +/- 6.6% vs 57.5% +/- 1.7%, P = 0.007); however, LINE-1
   hypomethylation was more evident in pancreatic cancer tissues than in
   pancreatic fluids (45.4% +/- 5.5% vs 58.7% +/- 4.3%, P < 0.001). CpG
   island hypermethylation of tumor-associated genes was detected at
   various frequencies, but it was not correlated with LINE-1
   hypomethylation. Hypermethylation of the UCHL1 gene was cancer-specific
   and most frequently detected in pancreatic (67%) or biliary (70%) fluids
   from patients with pancreatobiliary cancer. As a single marker,
   hypermethylation of the UCHL1 gene in pancreatic and biliary fluids was
   most useful for the detection of pancreatic and pancreatobiliary
   cancers, respectively (100% specificity). Hypermethylation of the UCHL1
   and RUNX3 genes in pancreatic and biliary fluids was the most useful
   combined marker for pancreatic (87% sensitivity and 100% specificity)
   and pancreatobiliary (97% sensitivity and 100% specificity) cancers.
   Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-AZA-2'-deoxycytidine, restored
   UCHL1 expression in pancreatobiliary cancer cell lines.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hypermethylation of UCHL1 and RUNX3
   in pancreatobiliary fluid might be useful for the diagnosis of
   pancreatobiliary cancers. (C) 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI Thyroid hormone receptor and liver X receptor competitively up-regulate
   human selective Alzheimer's disease indicator-1 gene expression at the
   transcriptional levels
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Selective Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicator-1 (Seladin-1) gene has been
   identified as a gene, whose expression is down-regulated in the
   vulnerable region in the brain of AD patients. Thyroid hormone (TH) is
   important to maintain the function of central nervous system and TH
   receptor (TR) is known to crosstalk with liver X receptor (LXR) on the
   lipid metabolism-related gene promoter. Recently, we have demonstrated
   that TR-beta up-regulates the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter at the
   transcriptional levels and LXR-alpha compensates the promoter activation
   only when the thyroid function is insufficient. In the current study, we
   have identified that TH and an LXR artificial agonist, TO901317 (TO)
   activated the human Seladin-1 promoter (-1024/+57 base pair (bp))
   including consensus TH response element (TRE) half site (site A: -381 to
   -375 bp), and the site A mutation deteriorated the activation by TH and
   TO. Both TR-beta and LXR-alpha heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor
   (RXR)-alpha on the site A, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
   assay revealed that TR-beta, LXR-alpha and RXR-alpha are recruited to
   the site A. Moreover, TR-beta and LXR-alpha functionally compete for the
   promoter activation in CV1 cells. Taken together, we concluded that
   TR-beta and LXR-alpha competitively up-regulate the human Seladin-1
   promoter, sharing the same response element, site A. (C) 2013 Elsevier

TI Elevated methylation of HPV16 DNA is associated with the development of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB We explored the association of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA
   methylation with age, viral load, viral persistence and risk of incident
   and prevalent high grade CIN (CIN2+) in serially collected specimens
   from the Guanacaste, Costa Rica cohort. 273 exfoliated cervical cell
   specimens (diagnostic and pre-diagnostic) were selected: (1) 92 with
   HPV16 DNA clearance (controls), (2) 72 with HPV16 DNA persistence
   (without CIN2+) and (3) 109 with CIN2+. DNA was extracted, bisulfite
   converted and methylation was quantified using pyrosequencing assays at
   66 CpGs across the HPV genome. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
   determine significant differences among groups, and receiver operating
   characteristic curve analyses were used to evaluate how well methylation
   identified women with CIN2+. In diagnostic specimens, 88% of CpG sites
   had significantly higher methylation levels in CIN2+ after correction
   for multiple tests compared with controls. The highest area under the
   ROC curve (AUC) was 0.82 for CpG site 6457 in L1, and a diagnostic
   sensitivity of 91% corresponded to a specificity of 60% for CIN2+.
   Prospectively, 17% of CpG sites had significantly higher methylation in
   pre-diagnostic CIN2+ specimens (median time of 3 years before diagnosis)
   versus controls. The strongest pre-diagnostic CpG site was 6367 in L1
   with an AUC of 0.76. Age-stratified analyses suggested that women older
   than the median age of 28 years have an increased risk of precancer
   associated with high methylation. Higher methylation in CIN2+ cases was
   not explained by higher viral load. We conclude that elevated levels of
   HPV16 DNA methylation may be useful to predict concurrently diagnosed as
   well as future CIN2+.

TI Effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on embryo-larval development and

SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB Pesticides may be involved in oyster summer mortality events, not
   necessarily as a single causative agent but as an additional,stressor.
   In this context, the present study aimed to assess the toxicity of
   glyphosate, its by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and two
   commercial formulations, Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and Roundup Allees
   et Terrasses (R) (R-AT), containing glyphosate as the active ingredient,
   on the early life stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The
   embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both
   the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of
   abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of
   metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h.
   Experiments involving both endpoints included range finding experiments
   for herbicide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100,000 mu g L-1. This
   range was then narrowed down in order to determine precise EC50 values.
   Actual concentrations of the herbicide were determined at the beginning
   and after 48 h (embryotoxicity) and 24 h (metamorphosis) to evaluate the
   potential temporal variation in the concentrations. During embryo-larval
   development, no mortalities were recorded at any of the concentrations
   of glyphosate and AMPA, whereas no embryos or D-shaped larvae could be
   observed after exposure to 10,000 mu g L-1 of R-EX or R-AT. Compared
   with the controls, no effects on embryo-larval development were recorded
   between 0.1 and 1000 mu g L-1, regardless of the chemical tested. Above
   a threshold, which varied according to the chemical used, the gradient
   of herbicide concentrations correlated with a gradient of severity of
   abnormality ranging from normal larvae to arrested development (an "old
   embryo" stage). The EC50 values were 28,315 and 40,617 mu g L-1 for
   glyphosate and its metabolite, respectively, but much lowered values of
   1133 and 1675 mu g L-1 for R-EX and R-AT, respectively. Metamorphosis
   tests also revealed a significant difference between molecules, as the
   EC50 values exceeded 100,000 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and AMPA but were
   as low as 6366 and 6060 mu g L-1 for the commercial formulations, which
   appeared relatively more toxic. Overall, the embryo-larval development
   of C. gigas was more sensitive to glyphosate-based herbicides compared
   to various endpoints studied in regulatory model organisms, and embryos
   and D-shaped larvae were more sensitive compared to pediveliger larvae.

TI The tumor suppressor SirT2 regulates cell cycle progression and genome
   stability by modulating the mitotic deposition of H4K20 methylation
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB The establishment of the epigenetic mark H4K20me1 (monomethylation of
   H4K20) by PR-Set7 during G(2)/M directly impacts S-phase progression and
   genome stability. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of
   this event are not well understood. Here we show that SirT2 regulates
   H4K20me1 deposition through the deacetylation of H4K16Ac (acetylation of
   H4K16) and determines the levels of H4K20me2/3 throughout the cell
   cycle. SirT2 binds and deacetylates PR-Set7 at K90, modulating its
   chromatin localization. Consistently, SirT2 depletion significantly
   reduces PR-Set7 chromatin levels, alters the size and number of PR-Set7
   foci, and decreases the overall mitotic deposition of H4K20me1. Upon
   stress, the interaction between SirT2 and PR-Set7 increases along with
   the H4K20me1 levels, suggesting a novel mitotic checkpoint mechanism.
   SirT2 loss in mice induces significant defects associated with defective
   H4K20me1-3 levels. Accordingly, SirT2-deficient animals exhibit genomic
   instability and chromosomal aberrations and are prone to tumorigenesis.
   Our studies suggest that the dynamic cross-talk between the environment
   and the genome during mitosis determines the fate of the subsequent cell
   cycle.

TI An electrochemical assay for DNA methylation, methyltransferase activity
   and inhibitor screening based on methyl binding domain protein
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB DNA methylation is one of important epigenetics events, and responsible
   to transcription, genomic imprinting and cellular differentiation.
   Aberrant DNA methylation is always contacted with various diseases.
   Methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins can specifically bind to the
   methylated CpG dinucleotides. Conventional assay for DNA methylation
   normally need bisulfide treatment, methylated nucleotide labeling or PCR
   amplification. Here, we fabricated a novel electrochemical biosensor for
   detection of DNA methylation, assay of DNA methyltransferase (MTase)
   activity and screening of MTase inhibitor based on MBD protein and
   coomassie brilliant blue G250 (CBB-G250), where the electrochemical
   signal of CBB-G250 was used to monitor the methylation event. After the
   hybrids of DNA S1 and DNA S2 were treated with M. SssI MTase in the
   presence of S-adenosylmethionine, the MBD proteins were specifically
   conjugated to the methylation site of CpG dinucleotides, and then, the
   MBD proteins were stained with CBB-G250. The electrochemical signal of
   CBB-G250 increased linearly with increasing M. SssI MTase concentration
   in the range from 0.1 to 40 unit/mL. Furthermore, the inhibition
   investigation demonstrates that fisetin and chlorogenic acid can inhibit
   the M. SssI MTase activity with the IC(50) value of 153.12 and 137.07 mu
   M, respectively. Therefore, we think that this study may provide a
   sensitive platform for screening of DNA MTase inhibitors. (C) 2012

TI Interaction with Suv39H1 is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin
   repression in breast cancer
SO ONCOGENE
AB Expression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT), is often lost due to promoter DNA methylation in
   basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), which contributes to the metastatic
   advantage of this disease; however, the underlying mechanism remains
   unclear. Here, we identified that Snail interacted with Suv39H1
   (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1), a major methyltransferase
   responsible for H3K9me3 that intimately links to DNA methylation. We
   demonstrated that the SNAG domain of Snail and the SET domain of Suv39H1
   were required for their mutual interactions. We found that H3K9me3 and
   DNA methylation on the E-cadherin promoter were higher in BLBC cell
   lines. We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to
   the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of
   Suv39H1 restored E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA
   methylation and resulted in the inhibition of cell migration, invasion
   and metastasis of BLBC. Our study not only reveals a critical mechanism
   underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT, but also paves a way for
   the development of new treatment strategies against this disease.

TI CTCF and Cohesin: Linking Gene Regulatory Elements with Their Targets
SO CELL
AB Current epigenomics approaches have facilitated the genome-wide
   identification of regulatory elements based on chromatin features and
   transcriptional regulator binding and have begun to map long-range
   interactions between regulatory elements and their targets. Here, we
   focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating
   long-range interactions between regulatory elements. We discuss how
   species-specific transposable elements may influence such interactions
   by remodeling the CTCF binding repertoire and suggest that cohesin's
   association with enhancers, promoters, and sites defined by CTCF binding
   has the potential to form developmentally regulated networks of
   long-range interactions that reflect and promote cell-type-specific
   transcriptional programs.

TI H3K4 methyltransferase Set1 is involved in maintenance of ergosterol
   homeostasis and resistance to Brefeldin A
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Set1 is a conserved histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase that
   exists as a multisubunit complex. Although H3K4 methylation is located
   on many actively transcribed genes, few studies have established a
   direct connection showing that loss of Set1 and H3K4 methylation results
   in a phenotype caused by disruption of gene expression. In this study,
   we determined that cells lacking Set1 or Set1 complex members that
   disrupt H3K4 methylation have a growth defect when grown in the presence
   of the antifungal drug Brefeldin A (BFA), indicating that H3K4
   methylation is needed for BFA resistance. To determine the role of Set1
   in BFA resistance, we discovered that Set1 is important for the
   expression of genes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, including
   the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Consequently, deletion of
   SET1 leads to a reduction in HMG-CoA reductase protein and total
   cellular ergosterol. In addition, the lack of Set1 results in an
   increase in the expression of DAN1 and PDR11, two genes involved in
   ergosterol uptake. The increase in expression of uptake genes in set1
   Delta cells allows sterols such as cholesterol and ergosterol to be
   actively taken up under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, when grown in
   the presence of ergosterol set1 Delta cells become resistant to BFA,
   indicating that proper ergosterol levels are needed for antifungal drug
   resistance. These data show that H3K4 methylation impacts gene
   expression and output of a biologically and medically relevant pathway
   and determines why cells lacking H3K4 methylation have antifungal drug
   sensitivity.

TI Peri-conceptional changes in maternal exposure to sewage sludge
   chemicals disturbs fetal thyroid gland development in sheep
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Ewes were exposed to sewage sludge-fertilized pastures in a study
   designed investigate pre-conceptual and/or gestational exposure to
   environmental chemicals. The in utero impact on fetal thyroid morphology
   and function at day 110 (of 145) of pregnancy was then determined.
   Pre-conceptual exposure increased the relative thyroid organ weights in
   male fetuses. The number of thyroid follicles in thyroids of fetuses
   after pre-conceptual or gestational exposure was reduced. This
   correlated with an increase in Ki67 positive cells. Pre-conceptual
   exposure to sewage sludge reduced small blood vessels in fetal thyroids.
   Thyroid tissues of exposed fetuses contained regions where mature
   angiofollicular units were reduced exhibiting decreased immunostaining
   for sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Fetal plasma levels of fT3 and fT4 in
   exposed animals, however, were not different from controls suggesting
   compensatory changes in the thyroid gland to maintain homeostasis in
   exposed fetuses. The regional aberrations in thyroid morphology may
   impact on the post-natal life of the exposed offspring. (C) 2012

TI Biochemical Analysis of Histone Deacetylase-independent Transcriptional
   Repression by MeCP2
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB MeCP2 is an abundant methyl-cytosine-guanine (CG)-binding protein and
   transcriptional repressor. We developed a biochemical system that
   exhibits CG methylation-specific transcriptional repression by purified
   human MeCP2. MeCP2 represses transcription by histone deacetylase
   (HDAC)-dependent and HDAC-independent mechanisms. Our system appears to
   recreate the HDAC-independent component of MeCP2-mediated repression and
   occurs via inhibition of the assembly of transcription preinitiation
   complexes. At a ratio of approximately one molecule of MeCP2 per two
   methyl-CG dinucleotides, as found in mammalian neurons, the magnitude of
   methylation-specific repression was greater than 10-fold. Notably, the
   HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A had no effect on MeCP2-mediated repression
   with either naked DNA or chromatin templates. We designed a CG-deficient
   core promoter that is resistant to MeCP2-mediated repression when placed
   in a plasmid lacking CG dinucleotides. By using this CG-deficient
   reporter as a reference, we found that eight CG dinucleotides in the
   core promoter region are sufficient for strong methylation-specific
   repression by MeCP2. In contrast, MeCP2 does not repress a construct
   with 13 CG dinucleotides located similar to 1.7 kbp upstream of the
   promoter. Furthermore, by analysis of C-terminally truncated MeCP2
   proteins, we found that binding of MeCP2 to methyl-CG dinucleotides is
   not sufficient for transcriptional repression. Hence, MeCP2-mediated
   repression is not due to the simple steric blockage of the
   transcriptional machinery. These experiments suggest that MeCP2 can
   function as a global methyl-CG-specific, HDAC-independent repressor.
   This HDAC-independent mechanism of MeCP2-mediated repression may be
   important in cells, such as mammalian neurons, that have high levels of
   CG methylation and MeCP2.

TI Modification of Enhancer Chromatin: What, How, and Why?
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Emergence of form and function during embryogenesis arises in large part
   through cell-type- and cell-state-specific variation in gene expression
   patterns, mediated by specialized cis-regulatory elements called
   enhancers. Recent large-scale epigenomic mapping revealed unexpected
   complexity and dynamics of enhancer utilization patterns, with 400,000
   putative human enhancers annotated by the ENCODE project alone. These
   large-scale efforts were largely enabled through the understanding that
   enhancers share certain stereotypical chromatin features. However, an
   important question still lingers: what is the functional significance of
   enhancer chromatin modification? Here we give an overview of
   enhancer-associated modifications of histones and DNA and discuss
   enzymatic activities involved in their dynamic deposition and removal.
   We describe potential downstream effectors of these marks and propose
   models for exploring functions of chromatin modification in regulating
   enhancer activity during development.

TI TET2 and TET3 regulate GlcNAcylation and H3K4 methylation through OGT
   and SET1/COMPASS
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB TET proteins convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine, an
   emerging dynamic epigenetic state of DNA that can influence
   transcription. Evidence has linked TET1 function to epigenetic
   repression complexes, yet mechanistic information, especially for the
   TET2 and TET3 proteins, remains limited. Here, we show a direct
   interaction of TET2 and TET3 with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). OGT does
   not appear to influence hmC activity, rather TET2 and TET3 promote OGT
   activity. TET2/3-OGT co-localize on chromatin at active promoters
   enriched for H3K4me3 and reduction of either TET2/3 or OGT activity
   results in a direct decrease in H3K4me3 and concomitant decreased
   transcription. Further, we show that Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF1), a
   component of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET1/COMPASS complex, is a
   specific GlcNAcylation target of TET2/3-OGT, and modification of HCF1 is
   important for the integrity of SET1/COMPASS. Additionally, we find both
   TET proteins and OGT activity promote binding of the SET1/COMPASS H3K4
   methyltransferase, SETD1A, to chromatin. Finally, studies in Tet2
   knockout mouse bone marrow tissue extend and support the data as
   decreases are observed of global GlcNAcylation and also of H3K4me3,
   notably at several key regulators of haematopoiesis. Together, our
   results unveil a step-wise model, involving TET-OGT interactions,
   promotion of GlcNAcylation, and influence on H3K4me3 via SET1/COMPASS,
   highlighting a novel means by which TETs may induce transcriptional
   activation. The EMBO Journal (2013) 32, 645-655.

TI Histone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20 is required for MLL-rearranged
   leukemia
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusions are potent oncogenes that initiate
   aggressive forms of acute leukemia. As aberrant transcriptional
   regulators, MLL-fusion proteins alter gene expression in hematopoietic
   cells through interactions with the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79)
   methyltransferase DOT1L. Notably, interference with MLL-fusion cofactors
   like DOT1L is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this disease. Here, we
   identify the histone H2B E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 20
   (RNF20) as an additional chromatin regulator that is necessary for
   MLL-fusion-mediated leukemo-genesis. Suppressing the expression of Rnf20
   in diverse models of MLL-rearranged leukemia leads to inhibition of cell
   proliferation, under tissue culture conditions as well as in vivo. Rnf20
   knockdown leads to reduced expression of MLL-fusion target genes,
   effects resembling Dot1l inhibition. Using ChIP-seq, we found that H2B
   ubiquitination is enriched in the body of MLL-fusion target genes,
   correlating with sites of H3K79 methylation and transcription
   elongation. Furthermore, Rnf20 is required to maintain local levels of
   H3K79 methylation by Dot1l at Hoxa9 and Meis1. These findings support a
   model whereby cotranscriptional recruitment of Rnf20 at MLL-fusion
   target genes leads to amplification of Dot1l-mediated H3K79 methylation,
   thereby rendering leukemia cells dependent on Rnf20 to maintain their
   oncogenic transcriptional program.

TI Adenosine A(2A) receptor blockade reverts hippocampal stress-induced
   deficits and restores corticosterone circadian oscillation
SO MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB Maternal separation (MS) is an early life stress model that induces
   permanent changes in the central nervous system, impairing hippocampal
   long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial working memory. There are
   compelling evidences for a role of hippocampal adenosine A(2A) receptors
   in stress-induced modifications related to cognition, thus opening a
   potential window for therapeutic intervention. Here, we submitted rats
   to MS and evaluated the long-lasting molecular, electrophysiological and
   behavioral impairments in adulthood. We then assessed the therapeutic
   potential of KW6002, a blocker of A(2A) receptors, in stress-impaired
   animals. We report that the blockade of A(2A) receptors was efficient in
   reverting the behavior, electrophysiological and morphological
   impairments induced by MS. In addition, this effect is associated with
   restoration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis)
   activity, as both the plasma corticosterone levels and hippocampal
   glucocorticoid receptor expression pattern returned to
   physiological-like status after the treatment. These results reveal the
   involvement of A(2A) receptors in the stress-associated impairments and
   directly in the stress response system by showing that the dysfunction
   of the HPA-axis as well as the long-lasting synaptic and behavioral
   effects of MS can be reverted by targeting adenosine A(2A) receptors.
   These findings provide a novel evidence for the use of adenosine A(2A)
   receptor antagonists as potential therapy against psychopathologies.

TI Pond Acidification May Explain Differences in Corticosterone among
   Salamander Populations
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY
AB Physiological tolerances play a key role in determining species
   distributions and abundance across a landscape, and understanding these
   tolerances can therefore be useful in predicting future changes in
   species distributions that might occur. Vertebrates possess several
   highly conserved physiological mechanisms for coping with environmental
   stressors, including the hormonal stress response that involves an
   endocrine cascade resulting in the increased production of
   glucocorticoids. We examined the function of this endocrine axis by
   assessing both baseline and acute stress-induced concentrations of
   corticosterone in larvae from eight natural breeding populations of
   Jefferson's salamander Ambystoma jeffersonianum. We surveyed individuals
   from each pond and also examined a variety of environmental pond
   parameters. We found that baseline and stress-induced corticosterone
   concentrations differed significantly among ponds. Population-level
   baseline corticosterone concentrations were negatively related to pH and
   positively related to nitrate, and stress-induced concentrations were
   again negatively related to pH, positively related to nitrate, and
   positively related to temperature. We followed the field survey with an
   outdoor mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated pH and again
   examined baseline and acute stress-induced corticosterone in A.
   jeffersonianum larvae. As in the field survey, we observed an increase
   in the baseline corticosterone concentration of individuals exposed to
   the lowest pH treatment (pH 5-5.8). Examining physiological indices
   using a combined approach of field surveys and experiments can be a
   powerful tool for trying to unravel the complexities of environmental
   impacts on species distributions.

TI Transcriptome and Quantitative Proteome Analysis Reveals Molecular
   Processes Associated with Larval Metamorphosis in the Polychaete
   Pseudopolydora vexillosa
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Larval growth of the polychaete worm Pseudopolydora vexillosa involves
   the formation of segment specific structures When larvae attain
   competency to settle, they discard swimming chaetae and secrete mucus.
   The larvae build tubes around themselves and metamorphose into benthic
   juveniles. Understanding the molecular processes, which regulate this
   complex and unique transition, remains a major challenge because of the
   limited molecular information available. To improve this situation, we
   conducted high-throughput RNA sequencing and quantitative proteome
   analysis of the larval stages of P. vexillosa. Based on gene ontology
   (GO) analysis, transcripts related to cellular and metabolic processes,
   binding, and catalytic activities were highly represented during
   larval-adult transition. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
   calcium-signaling, Wnt/beta-catenin, and notch signaling metabolic
   pathways were enriched in transcriptome data. Quantitative proteomics
   identified 107 differentially expressed proteins in three distinct
   larval stages. Fourteen and 53 proteins exhibited specific differential
   expression during competency and metamorphosis, respectively. Dramatic
   up regulation of proteins involved in signaling, metabolism, and
   cytoskeleton functions were found during the larval juvenile transition.
   Several proteins involved in cell signaling, cytoskeleton and metabolism
   were up regulated, whereas proteins related to transcription and
   oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated during competency. The
   integration of high-throughput RNA sequencing and quantitative
   proteomics allowed a global scale analysis of larval
   transcripts/proteins associated molecular processes in the metamorphosis
   of polychaete worms. Further, transcriptomic and proteomic insights
   provide a new direction to understand the fundamental mechanisms that
   regulate larval metamorphosis in polychaetes.

TI Sparsely correlated hidden Markov models with application to genome-wide
   location studies
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: Multiply correlated datasets have become increasingly common
   in genome-wide location analysis of regulatory proteins and epigenetic
   modifications. Their correlation can be directly incorporated into a
   statistical model to capture underlying biological interactions, but
   such modeling quickly becomes computationally intractable.
   Results: We present sparsely correlated hidden Markov models (scHMM), a
   novel method for performing simultaneous hidden Markov model (HMM)
   inference for multiple genomic datasets. In scHMM, a single HMM is
   assumed for each series, but the transition probability in each series
   depends on not only its own hidden states but also the hidden states of
   other related series. For each series, scHMM uses penalized regression
   to select a subset of the other data series and estimate their effects
   on the odds of each transition in the given series. Following this,
   hidden states are inferred using a standard forward-backward algorithm,
   with the transition probabilities adjusted by the model at each
   position, which helps retain the order of computation close to fitting
   independent HMMs (iHMM). Hence, scHMM is a collection of inter-dependent
   non-homogeneous HMMs, capable of giving a close approximation to a fully
   multivariate HMM fit. A simulation study shows that scHMM achieves
   comparable sensitivity to the multivariate HMM fit at a much lower
   computational cost. The method was demonstrated in the joint analysis of
   39 histone modifications, CTCF and RNA polymerase II in human CD4+ T
   cells. scHMM reported fewer high-confidence regions than iHMM in this
   dataset, but scHMM could recover previously characterized histone
   modifications in relevant genomic regions better than iHMM. In addition,
   the resulting combinatorial patterns from scHMM could be better mapped
   to the 51 states reported by the multivariate HMM method of Ernst and
   Kellis.

TI Loss of methylation in CpG sites in the NF-B enhancer elements of
   inducible nitric oxide synthase is responsible for gene induction in
   human articular chondrocytes
SO ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM
AB Objective To investigate whether the abnormal expression of inducible
   nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by osteoarthritic (OA) human chondrocytes
   is associated with changes in the DNA methylation status in the promoter
   and/or enhancer elements of iNOS. Methods Expression of iNOS was
   quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain
   reaction. The DNA methylation status of the iNOS promoter and enhancer
   regions was determined by bisulfite sequencing or pyrosequencing. The
   effect of CpG methylation on iNOS promoter and enhancer activities was
   determined using a CpG-free luciferase vector and a CpG
   methyltransferase. Cotransfections with expression vectors encoding NF-B
   subunits were carried out to analyze iNOS promoter and enhancer
   activities in response to changes in methylation status. Results The
   1,000-bp iNOS promoter has only 7 CpG sites, 6 of which were highly
   methylated in both control and OA samples. The CpG site at 289 and the
   sites in the starting coding region were largely unmethylated in both
   groups. The NF-B enhancer region at 5.8 kb was significantly
   demethylated in OA samples compared with control samples. This enhancer
   element was transactivated by cotransfection with the NF-B subunit p65,
   alone or together with p50. Critically, methylation treatment of the
   iNOS enhancer element significantly decreased its activity in a reporter
   assay. Conclusion These findings demonstrate the association between
   demethylation of specific NF-Bresponsive enhancer elements and the
   activation of iNOS transactivation in human OA chondrocytes, consistent
   with the differences in methylation status observed in vivo in normal
   and human OA cartilage and, importantly, show association with the OA
   process.

TI Artificial rain and cold wind act as stressors to captive molting and
   non-molting European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Free-roaming animals continually cope with changes in their environment.
   One of the most unpredictable environmental phenomena is weather. Being
   able to respond to weather appropriately is crucial as it can be a
   threat to survival. The stress response, consisting of increases in
   heart rate and release of glucocorticoids, is an important mechanism by
   which animals cope with stressors. This study examined behavioral, heart
   rate, and corticosterone responses of captive European starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris) to two aspects of weather mimicked under controlled
   conditions, a subtle (3 degrees C) decrease in temperature and a short,
   mild bout of rain. Both decreased temperature and exposure to rain
   elicited increases in heart rate and corticosterone in non-molting
   starlings. Molt is an important life history stage in birds that affects
   feather cover and may require a different response to weather-related
   stressors. We repeated the experiment in molting starlings and found
   increases in heart rate in response to rain and cold wind. However, the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis was suppressed during molt, as
   molting starlings did not increase corticosterone release in response to
   either stimulus. These data suggest these stimuli induce increased
   allostatic load in starlings, and that animals may adjust their response
   depending on the life-history stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI 5-Aza-2 '-Deoxycytidine Has Minor Effects on Differentiation in Human
   Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines, But Modulates Genes That Are Involved in
   Adaptation In Vitro
SO THYROID
AB Background: In thyroid cancer, the lack of response to specific
   treatment, for example, radioactive iodine, can be caused by a loss of
   differentiation characteristics of tumor cells. It is hypothesized that
   this loss is due to epigenetic modifications. Therefore, drugs releasing
   epigenetic repression have been proposed to reverse this silencing.
   Methods: We investigated which genes were reinduced in dedifferentiated
   human thyroid cancer cell lines when treated with the demethylating
   agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) and the histone deacetylase
   inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, by
   using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and microarrays.
   These results were compared to the expression patterns in in vitro human
   differentiated thyrocytes and in in vivo dedifferentiated thyroid
   cancers. In addition, the effects of 5-AzadC on DNA quantities and cell
   viability were investigated.
   Results: Among the canonical thyroid differentiation markers, most were
   not, or only to a minor extent, re-expressed by 5-AzadC, whether or not
   combined with TSA or forskolin, an inducer of differentiation in normal
   thyrocytes. Furthermore, 5-AzadC-modulated overall mRNA expression
   profiles showed only few commonly regulated genes compared to
   differentiated cultured primary thyrocytes. In addition, most of the
   commonly strongly 5-AzadC-induced genes in cell lines were either not
   regulated or upregulated in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Further
   analysis of which genes were induced by 5-AzadC showed that they were
   involved in pathways such as apoptosis, antigen presentation, defense
   response, and cell migration. A number of these genes had similar
   expression responses in 5-AzadC-treated nonthyroid cell lines.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that 5-AzadC is not a strong inducer of
   differentiation in thyroid cancer cell lines. Under the studied
   conditions and with the model used, 5-AzadC treatment does not appear to
   be a potential redifferentiation treatment for dedifferentiated thyroid
   cancer. However, this may reflect primarily the inadequacy of the model
   rather than that of the treatment. Moreover, the observation that
   5-AzadC negatively affected cell viability in cell lines could still
   suggest a therapeutic opportunity. Some of the genes that were modulated
   by 5-AzadC were also induced in nonthyroid cancer cell lines, which
   might be explained by an epigenetic modification resulting in the
   adaptation of the cell lines to their culture conditions.

TI Aberrant patterns of H3K4 and H3K27 histone lysine methylation occur
   across subgroups in medulloblastoma
SO ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB Recent sequencing efforts have described the mutational landscape of the
   pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Although MLL2 is among the most
   frequent somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV), the clinical and
   biological significance of these mutations remains uncharacterized.
   Through targeted re-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 %
   (14/175) of MBs, the majority of which were loss of function. Notably,
   we also report mutations affecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4
   % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 mutations were independent of age,
   gender, histological subtype, M-stage or molecular subgroup, KDM6A
   mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 MBs, and were
   mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for
   H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A
   activity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in
   24 % (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and
   KDM6A-driven histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of
   MB with improved (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed
   primarily within Group 3 and 4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate
   somatic copy number aberrations, and transcriptional profiles that
   converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2, KDM6A, KDM6B), leading
   to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated aberrant methylation
   of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other diseases, it
   represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of
   medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.

TI Chromatin signatures and retrotransposon profiling in mouse embryos
   reveal regulation of LINE-1 by RNA
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB How a more plastic chromatin state is maintained and reversed during
   development is unknown. Heterochromatin-mediated silencing of repetitive
   elements occurs in differentiated cells. Here, we used repetitive
   elements, including retrotransposons, as model loci to address how and
   when heterochromatin forms during development. RNA sequencing throughout
   early mouse embryogenesis revealed that repetitive-element expression is
   dynamic and stage specific, with most repetitive elements becoming
   repressed before implantation. We show that LINE-1 and IAP
   retrotransposons become reactivated from both parental genomes after
   fertilization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 in
   2- and 8-cell embryos indicates that their developmental silencing
   follows loss of activating marks rather than acquisition of conventional
   heterochromatic marks. Furthermore, short LINE-1 RNAs regulate LINE-1
   transcription in vivo. Our data indicate that reprogramming after
   mammalian fertilization comprises a robust transcriptional activation of
   retrotransposons and that repetitive elements are initially regulated
   through RNA.

TI Global DNA Hypomethylation in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells as a
   Biomarker of Cancer Risk
SO CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
AB Background: Global DNA hypomethylation is an early molecular event in
   carcinogenesis. Whether methylation measured in peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMCs) DNA is a clinically reliable biomarker for
   early detection or cancer risk assessment is to be established.
   Methods: From an original sample-set of 753 male and female adults (ages
   64.8 +/- 7.3 years), PBMCs DNA methylation was measured in 68 subjects
   with history of cancer at time of enrollment and 62 who developed cancer
   during follow-up. Age-and sex-matched controls for prevalent and
   incident cancer cases (n = 68 and 58, respectively) were also selected.
   Global DNA methylation was assessed by liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T
   genotype and plasma folate concentrations were also determined for the
   known gene-nutrient interaction affecting DNA methylation.
   Results: Cancer subjects had significantly lower PBMCs-DNA methylation
   than controls [4.39 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 4.25-4.53) vs. 5.13
   (95% CI, 5.03-5.21) %mCyt/(mCyt+Cyt); P < 0.0001]. A DNA methylation
   threshold of 4.74% clearly categorized patients with cancer from
   controls so that those with DNA methylation less than 4.74% showed an
   increased prevalence of cancer than those with higher levels (91.5% vs.
   19%; P < 0.001). Subjects with cancer at follow-up had, already at
   enrollment, reduced DNA methylation as compared with controls [4.34 (95%
   CI, 4.24-4.51) vs. 5.08 (95% CI, 5.05-5.22) %mCyt/(mCyt+Cyt); P <
   0.0001]. Moreover, MTHFR677C>T genotype and folate interact for
   determining DNA methylation, so that MTHFR677TT carriers with low folate
   had the lowest DNA methylation and concordantly showed a higher
   prevalence of cancer history (OR, 7.04; 95% CI, 1.52-32.63; P = 0.013).
   Conclusions: Genomic PBMCs-DNA methylation may be a useful epigenetic
   biomarker for early detection and cancer risk estimation.
   Impact: This study identifies a threshold for PBMCs-DNA methylation to
   detect cancer-affected from cancer-free subjects and an at-risk
   condition for cancer based on genomic DNA methylation and
   MTHFR677C>T-folate status. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22(3);

TI Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and function in bacteria
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY OF LIPIDS
AB Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in
   eukaryotes and is estimated to be present in about 15% of the domain
   Bacteria. Usually, PC can be synthesized in bacteria by either of two
   pathways, the phospholipid N-methylation (Pmt) pathway or the
   phosphatidylcholine synthase (Pcs) pathway. The three subsequent
   enzymatic methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine are performed by a
   single phospholipid N-methyltransferase in some bacteria whereas other
   bacteria possess multiple phospholipid N-methyltransferases each one
   performing one or several distinct methylation steps.
   Phosphatidylcholine synthase condenses choline directly with
   CDP-diacylglycerol to form CMP and PC. Like in eukaryotes, bacterial PC
   also functions as a biosynthetic intermediate during the formation of
   other biomolecules such as choline, diacylglycerol, or
   diacylglycerol-based phosphorus-free membrane lipids. Bacterial PC may
   serve as a specific recognition molecule but it affects the
   physicochemical properties of bacterial membranes as well. This article

TI Epiallele biogenesis in maize
SO GENE
AB We have correlated cytosine methylation of two epialleles, P1-rr and
   P1-pr, with variation in gene expression and therefore phenotype. The p1
   gene in maize encodes a transcription factor that controls phlobaphene
   pigment accumulation in floral tissues. While cytosine methylation was
   assayed in various regions spanning 17 kb, the only difference in DNA
   methylation pattern between the expressed P1-rr allele and the silenced
   P1-pr allele was detected in a region that consists of a complex
   arrangement of transposons and adjacent repeats. This region, which
   comprises the distal enhancer element of P1-rr, is hypermethylated in
   P1-pr compared to P1-rr. Based on other precedents, we hypothesize that
   DNA methylation spreads from the transposable elements into the flanking
   P1-rr enhancer, thereby transcriptionally silencing the gene.
   Interestingly, P1-pr is reactivated in mutants of the dominant
   epigenetic modifier Ufo1. DNA methylation in the distal enhancer
   sequence is significantly reduced, which inversely correlates with
   increased transcript levels and pigmentation in P1-pr Ufo1 plants. If in
   general DNA methylation spreads from transposons into adjacent sequences
   containing regulatory elements for neighboring genes, the corresponding
   genes could be silenced by chance. Given the large amount of
   transposable elements in the maize genome, epialleles may be far more
   frequent than previously estimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Coordinate Regulation of the Gel-forming Mucin Genes at Chromosome
   11p15.5
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Four of the genes that encode gel-forming mucins, which are major
   components of the mucus layer protecting many epithelial surfaces, are
   clustered at chromosome 11p15.5 and show both cell-and tissue-specific
   expression patterns. We aimed to determine whether the individual genes
   were coordinately regulated by mechanisms involving higher order
   chromatin structure. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites were predicted in
   silico and CTCF occupancy then evaluated by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation. CTCF was found at many sites across the gene
   cluster, and its binding was correlated with mucin gene expression.
   Next, siRNA-mediated depletion of CTCF was shown to increase MUC2
   expression in A549 lung carcinoma cells and both MUC6 and MUC5AC
   expression in LS180 colon carcinoma cells. These changes correlated with
   loss of CTCF binding at multiple sites, although others retained
   occupancy. In cells actively expressing the mucins, the gene cluster was
   shown by chromosome conformation capture to form looped
   three-dimensional structures with direct interactions between the MUC2
   promoter region, regions 30 kb 5' to it, close to the MUC6 promoter and
   others near the 3' end of MUC5AC, >170 kb away. Finally, to demonstrate
   the importance of CTCF binding to mucin gene expression, Calu-3 lung
   carcinoma cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS increased
   the expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC and reduced MUC5B. CTCF occupancy was
   concurrently depleted at specific binding sites close to these genes.
   These data suggest that CTCF binding and cell type-specific long-range
   interactions across the 11p15.5 gene cluster are critical mechanisms for
   coordinating gel-forming mucin gene expression.

SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB rRNA synthesis is regulated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
   Epigenetic states are metastable, changing in response to appropriate
   signals, thereby modulating transcription in vivo. The establishment,
   maintenance and reversal of epigenetic features are fundamental for the
   cell's ability to 'remember' past events, to adapt to environmental
   changes or developmental cues and to propagate this information to the
   progeny. As packaging into chromatin is critical for the stability and
   integrity of repetitive DNA, keeping a fraction of rRNA genes in a
   metastable heterochromatic conformation prevents aberrant exchanges
   between repeats, thus safeguarding nucleolar structure and rDNA
   stability. In this review, we will focus on the nature of the molecular
   signatures that characterize a given epigenetic state of rDNA in

   modifications, and the mechanisms by which they are established and

TI Vernalization and photoperiod-related changes in the DNA methylation
   state in winter and spring rapeseed
SO ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
AB Vernalization-induced flowering is an effect of the epigenetic
   regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation and histone
   modifications. Vernalization-mediated silencing of a floral repressor
   through histone modifications was shown in Arabidopsis thaliana.
   However, for Brassica napus L., the mechanism underlying vernalization
   is unclear, and the roles of DNA methylation and histone modifications
   have not been established. This study revealed the profiles of changes
   in the DNA methylation state during vernalization (after 14, 35, 56
   days) and the subsequent growth in long- or short-day photoperiods
   (after 2, 7, 14 days) in the winter and spring rapeseed using TLC and
   MSAP techniques. TLC analysis showed a significant decrease in the
   amount of 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) in genomic DNA in both cultivars at
   the beginning of vernalization, but upon its termination, the winter
   rape showed a reduced level of m(5)C contrary to a significantly
   increased level in the spring rape. MSAP analysis revealed that winter
   and spring rapeseed differed in the MSAP loci which were
   demethylated/methylated in the course of the experiment and presented
   diverse profiles of changes in the methylation state. The winter rape
   showed permanent demethylations at 69.2 % of MSAP loci in the course of
   vernalization that were mostly preserved upon its termination. The
   spring rape showed similar numbers of demethylations and methylations
   that were mainly transient. The study provides evidence of the role of
   DNA methylation in vernalization for rapeseed and for the significant
   prevalence of demethylations at the beginning of vernalization, which is
   necessary for the transition to reproductive growth.

TI Alteration in plasma corticosterone levels following long term oral
   administration of lead produces depression like symptoms in rats
SO METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE
AB Lead toxicity is known to induce a broad range of physiological,
   biochemical and behavioral dysfunctions that may result in adverse
   effects on several organs, including the central nervous system.
   Long-term exposure to low levels of lead (Pb(2+)) has been shown to
   produce behavioral deficits in rodents and humans by affecting
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. These deficits are thought to
   be associated with altered brain monoamine neurotransmission and due to
   changes in glucocorticoids levels. This study was designed to
   investigate the effects of Pb(2+)exposure on growth rate, locomotor
   activity, anxiety, depression, plasma corticosterone and brain serotonin
   (5-HT) levels in rats. Rats were exposed to lead in drinking water (500
   ppm; lead acetate) for 5 weeks. The assessment of depression was done
   using the forced swimming test (FST). Estimation of brain 5-HT was
   determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with
   electrochemical detection. Plasma corticosterone was determined by
   spectroflourimetric method. The present study showed that long term
   exposure to Pb(2+) significantly decreased the food intake followed by
   the decrease in growth rate in Pb(2+)exposed rats as compared to control
   group. No significant changes in open field activity were observed
   following Pb(2+)exposure while significant increase in anxiogenic effect
   was observed. Increased plasma corticosterone and decreased 5-HT levels
   were exhibited by Pb(2+)exposed rats as compared to controls. A
   significant increase in depressive like symptoms was exhibited by
   Pb(2+)exposed rats as compared to control rats. The results are
   discussed in the context of Pb(2+) inducing a stress-like response in
   rats leading to changes in plasma corticosterone and brain 5-HT levels
   via altering tryptophan pyrrolase activity.

TI Epigenetic correlates of plant phenotypic plasticity: DNA methylation
   differs between prickly and nonprickly leaves in heterophyllous Ilex
   aquifolium (Aquifoliaceae) trees
SO BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB Phenotypic plasticity is central to the persistence of populations and a
   key element in the evolution of species and ecological interactions, but
   its mechanistic basis is poorly understood. This article examines the
   hypothesis that epigenetic variation caused by changes in DNA
   methylation are related to phenotypic plasticity in a heterophyllous
   tree producing two contrasting leaf types. The relationship between
   mammalian browsing and the production of prickly leaves was studied in a
   population of Ilex aquifolium (Aquifoliaceae). DNA methylation profiles
   of contiguous prickly and nonprickly leaves on heterophyllous branchlets
   were compared using a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism
   (MSAP) method. Browsing and the production of prickly leaves were
   correlated across trees. Within heterophyllous branchlets, pairs of
   contiguous prickly and nonprickly leaves differed in genome-wide DNA
   methylation. The mean per-marker probability of methylation declined
   significantly from nonprickly to prickly leaves. Methylation differences
   between leaf types did not occur randomly across the genome, but
   affected predominantly certain specific markers. The results of this
   study, although correlative in nature, support the emerging three-way
   link between herbivory, phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic changes in
   plants, and also contribute to the crystallization of the consensus that
   epigenetic variation can complement genetic variation as a source of
   phenotypic variation in natural plant populations. (c) 2012 The Linnean

TI HDAC4 controls histone methylation in response to elevated cardiac load
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB In patients with heart failure, reactivation of a fetal gene program,
   including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide
   (BNP), is a hallmark for maladaptive remodeling of the LV. The
   mechanisms that regulate this reactivation are incompletely understood.
   Histone acetylation and methylation affect the conformation of
   chromatin, which in turn governs the accessibility of DNA for
   transcription factors. Using human LV myocardium, we found that, despite
   nuclear export of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), upregulation of ANP and
   BNP in failing hearts did not require increased histone acetylation in
   the promoter regions of these genes. In contrast, di- and trimethylation
   of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9) and binding of heterochromatin protein 1
   (HP1) in the promoter regions of these genes were substantially reduced.
   In isolated working murine hearts, an acute increase of cardiac preload
   induced HDAC4 nuclear export, H3K9 demethylation, HP1 dissociation from
   the promoter region, and activation of the ANP gene. These processes
   were reversed in hearts with myocyte-specific deletion of Hdac4. We
   conclude that HDAC4 plays a central role for rapid modifications of
   histone methylation in response to variations in cardiac load and may
   represent a target for pharmacological interventions to prevent
   maladaptive remodeling in patients with heart failure.

TI Epigenetic modification contributes to the expression divergence of
   three TaEXPA1 homoeologs in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum)
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Common wheat is a hexaploid species with most of the genes present as
   triplicate homoeologs. Expression divergences of homoeologs are
   frequently observed in wheat, as well as in other polyploid plants.
   However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly
   understood. Expansin genes play important roles in the regulation of
   cell size, as well as organ size. We found that all three TaEXPA1
   homoeologs were silenced in seedling roots. In seedling leaves,
   TaEXPA1-A and TaEXPA1-D were expressed, but TaEXPA1-B was silenced.
   Further analysis revealed that silencing of TaEXPA1-B in leaves occurred
   after the formation of the hexaploid. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assays revealed that the transcriptional silencing of three TaEXPA1
   homoeologs in roots was correlated with an increased level of H3K9
   dimethylation and decreased levels of H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9
   acetylation. Reactivation of TaEXPA1-A and TaEXPA1-D expression in
   leaves was correlated with increased levels of H3K4 trimethylation and
   H3K9 acetylation, and decreased levels of H3K9 dimethylation in their
   promoters, respectively. Moreover, a higher level of cytosine
   methylation was detected in the promoter region of TaEXPA1-B, which may
   contribute to its silencing in leaves. We demonstrated that epigenetic
   modifications contribute to the expression divergence of three TaEXPA1
   homoeologs during wheat development.

TI Genetic factors regulating inflammation and DNA methylation associated
   with prostate cancer
SO PROSTATE CANCER AND PROSTATIC DISEASES
AB BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) displays a strong familiarity
   component and genetic factors; genes regulating inflammation may have a
   pivotal role in the disease. Epigenetic changes control chromosomal
   integrity, gene functions and ultimately carcinogenesis. The enzyme
   glycine-N-methyltransferase (GNMT) contributes to S-adenosylmethionine
   level regulation and, by affecting DNA methylation, influences gene
   expression. The genotype and allele distribution of single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1 beta,
   alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and GNMT genes, the level of global DNA
   methylation and the influence of GNMT SNP upon DNA methylation in a PCa
   case-control study have been investigated.
   METHODS: SNPs of VEGF (rs699947), ACT (rs1884082), IL-1 beta (rs16944),
   IL-10 (rs1800896) and GNMT (rs9462856) genes were assessed by PCR or by
   real-time PCR methods. DNA methylation was assessed by an ELISA assay.
   RESULTS: Frequencies of the VEGF AA genotype, the IL-10 A allele and
   GNMT T allele were higher in PCa. The concomitant presence of the AA
   genotype of VEGF, the A allele of IL-10 and T allele of GNMT increased
   the risk of PCa. Total DNA methylation was decreased in PCa; control
   GNMT T carriers (T+) showed the highest level of DNA methylation.
   CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in VEGF, IL-10 and GNMT genes might have a synergistic
   role in the development of PCa. The GNMT T allele may influence PCa risk
   by affecting DNA methylation and prostate gene expression. Our
   observations might help implement the screening of unaffected subjects
   with an increased susceptibility to develop PCa. Prostate Cancer and

TI Methylation alterations at imprinted genes detected among long-term
   shiftworkers
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS
AB Exposure to light at night through shiftwork has been linked to
   alterations in DNA methylation and increased risk of cancer development.
   Using an Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay, we analyzed methylation
   levels of 397 CpG sites in the promoter regions of 56 normally imprinted
   genes to investigate whether shiftwork is associated with alteration of
   methylation patterns. Methylation was significantly higher at 20 CpG
   sites and significantly lower at 30 CpG sites (P < 0.05) in 10 female
   long-term shiftworkers as compared to 10 female age- and folate
   intake-matched day workers. The strongest evidence for altered
   methylation patterns in shiftworkers was observed for DLX5, IGF2AS, and
   TP73 based on the magnitude of methylation change and consistency in the
   direction of change across multiple CpG sites, and consistent results
   were observed using quantitative DNA methylation analysis. We conclude
   that long-term shiftwork may alter methylation patterns at imprinted
   genes, which may be an important mechanism by which shiftwork has
   carcinogenic potential and warrants further investigation. Environ. Mol.

TI Semiconductor technology for early detection of DNA methylation for

SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB The electrical detection of DNA methylation based biomarkers using
   semiconductor technology shows great promise for early cancer screening.
   Presented is the very first proof-of-concept example of using CMOS-based
   technology for real-time DNA methylation detection using Ion-Sensitive
   Field-Effect Transistors (ISFETs). An electrochemical label-free
   approach was applied in two gene assays, each one of which incorporated
   the sequences of DAPK1 and CDKN2A/p16-INK4 (p16) gene promoters at a
   both methylated and unmethylated state, performing isothermal
   methylation-specific amplification and detection both in-tube and
   on-chip (real-time). Good discrimination was shown between the two
   states, achieving a very good average pH signal change for the
   methylated state of 1.91 for DAPK1 assay and of 1.58 for p16 assay in
   the tube test. The real-time on-chip test showed similarly good
   real-time differential signal change in favour of methylated DNA,
   reaching 37 mV for DAPK1 assay and 23 mV for p16 assay, validating the
   results from the proof-of-concept test of pH-LAMP in-tube while
   confirming the sensitivity of real-time methylation-specific pH-LAMP
   on-chip. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Total sialic acid profile in regressing and remodelling organs during
   the metamorphosis of marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas 1771)
SO CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND FUNCTION
AB This study aimed to investigate the functional relationship of sialic
   acid in regressing and remodelling organs such as the tail, small
   intestine and liver during the metamorphosis of Pelophylax ridibundus.
   For this purpose, four groups were composed according to developmental
   periods by considering Gosner's criteria (1964). Our findings showed
   that the sialic acid content of the larval tail has an opposite profile
   to cell death process. Although the sialic acid content of the small
   intestine and liver did not change evidently during metamorphosis, it
   increased after the completion of metamorphosis. Frog tail extensively
   exhibited cell death process and decreased proliferative activity and
   underwent complete degeneration during metamorphic climax. In spite of
   increased apoptotic index, a decreased sialic acid level in the tail
   tissues during climax can be the indication of a death cell removal
   process. However, the intestine and the liver included both cell death
   and proliferative process and remodelling in their adult forms. Thus,
   their sialic acid profiles during metamorphosis were different from the
   tail's profile. These data show that sialic acid may be an indicator of
   the presence of some cellular events during metamorphosis and that it
   can have different roles in the developmental process depending on the
   organ's fate throughout metamorphosis. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley &

TI Dynamic methylation pattern of the methyltransferase1o (Dnmt1o) 5
   '-flanking region during mouse oogenesis and spermatogenesis
SO MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB DNA methyltransferase1o (Dnmt1o), which is specific to oocyte and
   preimplantation embryo, plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation in
   mammalian cells. Here, we investigated the methylation status of CpGs
   sites in the Dnmt1o 5-flanking region in germ cells at different stages
   of oogenesis or spermatogenesis. The methylation levels of the CpG sites
   at the 5-flanking regions were hypermethylated in growing oocytes of all
   follicular stages, while the oocytes in meiotic metaphase II (MII) were
   demethylated. The methylation pattern within the CpGs sites in the
   5-flanking region, however, was dramatically changed during
   spermatogenesis. We observed that there was significant non-CpG
   methylation both in MII oocytes and spermatocytes. Although a low
   methylation level in non-CpG sites was observed in primary and secondary
   oocytes, the CpA site of position 25 and CpT site of position 29 within
   the no-CpG region in the 5-flanking region of Dnmt1o was highly
   methylated in MII oocytes. During spermatogenesis, the low degree of
   methylation at CpG sites in spermatocytes increased to a higher degree
   in sperm, while the high ratio of methylation in non-CpG sites in
   spermatocytes decreased. Together, germ cells showed inverted
   methylation patterns between CpG and non-CpG sites in the Dnmt1o
   5-upstream region, and the methylation pattern during oogenesis did not
   drastically change, remaining generally hypomethylated at the MII stage.

TI Role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
   brain injury
SO EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
AB Background: DNA methylation and histone modifications are the most
   identified modifications that selectively activate or inactivate genes
   that control cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.
   Aim: We hypothesized that alterations in gene expression due to
   hypoxic-ischemic brain damage Was regulated by epigenetic mechanisms
   including DNA methylation and histone methylation.
   Study design: To test this hypothesis, we established a rat model of
   HIE. Three groups were defined as hypoxic-ischemic, sham-operated, and
   control group.
   Outcome measurements: The validity of the HIE model used in this study
   was confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical tests. Gene
   expressions related with apoptosis and angiogenesis were studied at 0.5,
   3, 6 and 24 h after HI or sham operation. DNA and histone methylation
   status was studied in the genes showing significant change in
   expression.
   Results and conclusions: Most of the genes related with apoptosis and
   angiogenesis (Epo, Epor, Hif1 alpha, Hif3 alpha, VEGFa, VEGFc, Casp1,
   Casp9, and Casp8ap2) induced early after HI (30 min). All of these genes
   were unmethylated at the beginning of the insult and in the control
   group. DNA methylation percentage and histone methylation (H3K36) levels
   were not correlated with gen expression levels. To our knowledge this is
   the first study evaluating the role of epigenetic mechanisms in HIE
   model, therefore the absence of similar studies don't allow us to
   compare the present results. Further studies investigating different
   epigenetic mechanisms are needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

TI Combined analysis of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein
   expression and promoter methylation provides optimized prognostication
   of glioblastoma outcome
SO NEURO-ONCOLOGY
AB Background. Promoter methylation of the DNA repair gene,
   O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), is associated with
   improved treatment outcome for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM)
   treated with standard chemoradiation. To determine the prognostic
   significance of MGMT protein expression as assessed by
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) and its relationship with methylation, we
   analyzed MGMT expression and promoter methylation with survival in a
   retrospective patient cohort.
   Methods. We identified 418 patients with newly diagnosed GBM at
   University of California Los Angeles Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles,
   nearly all of whom received chemoradiation, and determined MGMT
   expression by IHC, and MGMT promoter methylation by methylation-specific
   PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing (BiSEQ) of 24 neighboring CpG sites.
   Results. With use of the median percentage of cells staining by IHC as
   the threshold, patients with <30% staining had progression-free survival
   (PFS) of 10.9 months and overall survival (OS) of 20.5 months, compared
   with PFS of 7.8 months (P < .0001) and OS of 16.7 months (P < .0001)
   among patients with >= 30% staining. Inter- and intrareader correlation
   of IHC staining was high. Promoter methylation status by MSP was
   correlated with IHC staining. However, low IHC staining was frequently
   observed in the absence of promoter methylation. Increased methylation
   density determined by BiSEQ correlated with both decreased IHC staining
   and increased survival, providing a practical semiquantitative
   alternative to MSP. On the basis of multivariate analysis validated by
   bootstrap analysis, patients with tandem promoter methylation and low
   expression demonstrated improved OS and PFS, compared with the other
   combinations.
   Conclusions. Optimal assessment of MGMT status as a prognostic biomarker
   for patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with chemoradiation
   requires determination of both promoter methylation and IHC protein
   expression.

   assay for semen identification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
AB The detection of semen can assist in reconstructing the events of a
   sexual assault and impact the outcome of legal dispositions. Many
   methods currently are used for detecting the presence of semen, but they
   all have limitations with regards to specificity, sample
   degradation/consumption, stability of biomolecule assayed, and/or
   incompatibility with downstream individual identification assays. DNA is
   routinely collected at sexual assault crime scenes and is widely used
   for individual identification. The DNA also carries methylation patterns
   that are tissue specific. To date, however, assays designed to exploit
   methylation patterns suffer from complex chemistries and unwieldy
   analyses. DSI-Semen (TM) kit uses a novel approach involving CpG
   methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion coupled to a
   multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate an amplicon
   profile that makes it possible to determine whether the tissue source of
   a DNA sample was semen or non-semen. The assay returned an appropriate
   positive result for semen with neat semen, semen stains, and
   semen/non-semen tissue mixtures. The assay is robust and reliable, with
   a positive result for semen given as little as 31 pg of template DNA
   input. Low levels of semen were detected in mixtures of semen and other
   body fluids. UV-exposed samples and those in the presence of limited
   concentrations of known PCR inhibitors were typeable. The DSI-Semen (TM)
   kit provides a reliable tool for the determination of DNA being derived
   from semen.

TI Are white-crowned sparrow badges reliable signals?
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB Status badges, such as crown plumage, mediate intraspecific
   interactions. The reliability of crown morphology as a status badge in
   male mountain white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha)
   is uncertain. We examined morphological and physiological correlates of
   the proportion of crown that was white ("crown-white") in 178 male
   mountain white-crowned sparrows during the 2008-2009 breeding seasons.
   Using a paired experimental design, we presented territory-holding males
   with white-enhanced and white-reduced decoys and recorded aggressive
   behaviors. To assess physiological constraints on signal bluffing, a
   subsample of birds was captured and released after manipulating natural
   crowns to simulate bluffed white-enhanced or white-reduced crowns;
   corticosterone concentrations were assayed from blood drawn upon
   recapture and after a restraint-induced stressor. We found a significant
   positive association between crown-white and a measure of body
   size-tarsus length-which is an established indicator of resource-holding
   potential. In the decoy challenge, males responded more aggressively
   toward white-enhanced than white-reduced decoys. In the hormone
   experiment, white-enhanced birds had higher baseline corticosterone
   levels, whereas white-reduced birds had similar concentrations to
   controls. Furthermore, white-enhanced birds had an attenuated
   restraint-induced corticosterone response, while white-reduced birds
   mounted a significantly larger increase in corticosterone than controls.
   Taken together, these findings indicate that crown-white is a reliable
   status badge of resource-holding potential in male mountain
   white-crowned sparrows during the breeding season.

TI The correlation of genome size and DNA methylation rate in metazoans
SO THEORY IN BIOSCIENCES
AB Total DNA methylation rates are well known to vary widely between
   different metazoans. The phylogenetic distribution of this variation,
   however, has not been investigated systematically. We combine here
   publicly available data on methylcytosine content with the analysis of
   nucleotide compositions of genomes and transcriptomes of 78 metazoan
   species to trace the evolution of abundance and distribution of DNA
   methylation. The depletion of CpG and the associated enrichment of TpG
   and CpA dinucleotides are used to infer the intensity and localization
   of germline CpG methylation and to estimate its evolutionary dynamics.
   We observe a positive correlation of the relative methylation of CpG
   motifs with genome size. We tested this trend successfully by measuring
   total DNA methylation with LC/MS in orthopteran insects with very
   different genome sizes: house crickets, migratory locusts and meadow
   grasshoppers. We hypothesize that the observed correlation between
   methylation rate and genome size is due to a dependence of both
   variables from long-term effective population size and is driven by the
   accumulation of repetitive sequences that are typically methylated
   during periods of small population sizes. This process may result in
   generally methylated, large genomes such as those of jawed vertebrates.
   In this case, the emergence of a novel demethylation pathway and of
   novel reader proteins for methylcytosine may have enabled the usage of
   cytosine methylation for promoter-based gene regulation. On the other
   hand, persistently large populations may lead to a compression of the
   genome and to the loss of the DNA methylation machinery, as observed,
   e.g., in nematodes.

TI Delta-like 3 is silenced by methylation and induces apoptosis in human
   hepatocellular carcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB The genetic and epigenetic events of hepatocarcinogenesis are relatively
   poorly understood. By analyzing genes from human hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) with restriction landmark genomic scanning, several
   aberrantly methylated genes, including Delta-like 3 (DLL3), have been
   isolated. In this study, we investigated the function of DLL3 in
   hepatocarcinogenesis. Methylation of the DLL3 gene in HCC cell lines was
   investigated with methylation-specific PCR and expression of DLL3 mRNA
   in HCC cells was examined by RT-PCR. Reactivation of DLL3 expression by
   treatment with a demethylating agent was examined in
   methylation-silenced HuH2 cells. Human DLL3 cDNA was cloned and DLL3
   function was examined by restoring DLL3 expression in HuH2 cells. The
   effects of DLL3 on cell growth were evaluated by colony formation assay.
   Induction of cell death by overexpression of DLL3 was examined by flow
   cytometric assay using Annexin V and PI. Apoptotic cells were detected
   by TUNEL staining and the amount of single-stranded DNA was measured by
   ELISA. As a result, the promoter region of the DLL3 gene was methylated
   in four of ten HCC cell lines. This aberrant methylation correlated well
   with the suppression of RNA expression and a demethylating agent
   reactivated DLL3 expression in methylation-silenced HCC cells.
   Interestingly, the restoration of DLL3 in the methylation-silenced HuH2
   cells led to growth suppression on colony formation assay. Flow
   cytometric assay with Annexin V and PI showed that this growth
   suppression by DLL3 expression is associated with the induction of
   apoptosis. Furthermore, these apoptotic effects were confirmed by TUNEL
   staining and measurement of single-stranded DNA. These results suggest
   that DLL3 was silenced by methylation in human HCC and that it
   negatively regulates the growth of HCC cells.

TI The differential impact of social defeat on mice living in isolation or
   groups in an enriched environment: plasma corticosterone and monoamine
   variations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Social defeat in mice is a potent stressor that promotes the development
   of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours, as well as variations of
   neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter activity. Although
   environmental enrichment may protect against some of the adverse
   behavioural and biological effects of social defeat, it seems that,
   among male group-housed mice maintained in an enriched environment (EE),
   aggressive behaviours may be more readily instigated, thus promoting
   distress and exacerbating psychopathological features. Thus, although an
   EE can potentially have numerous beneficial effects, these may depend on
   the general conditions in which mice were raised. It was observed in the
   current investigations that EE group-housed BALB/cByJ mice displayed
   increased anxiety-like behaviours compared to their counterparts
   maintained in a standard environment (SE). Furthermore, in response to
   social defeat, EE group-housed male mice exhibited decreased weight
   gain, exaggerated corticosterone elevations and altered hippocampal
   norepinephrine utilization compared to their SE counterparts. These
   effects were not apparent in the individually housed EE mice and, in
   fact, enrichment among these mice appeared to buffer against serotonin
   changes induced by social defeat. It is possible that some potentially
   beneficial effects of enrichment were precluded among group-housed mice,
   possibly owing to social disturbances that might occur in these
   conditions. In fact, even if social interaction is an essential feature
   of enrichment, it seems that some of the positive effects of this
   housing condition might be optimal when mice are housed individually,
   particularly with regard to buffering the effects of social defeat.

TI MeCP2 modulates the canonical Wnt pathway activation by targeting SFRP4
   in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rats
SO CELLULAR SIGNALLING
AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the
   rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) against
   common autoantigens that are widely expressed within and outside the
   joints. Many factors participate in the pathogenesis of RA, such as
   cytokine imbalance, Wnt pathway activation, matrix production, and
   osteoprotegerin on osteoclasts. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS)
   activation has an important role in RA pathogenesis. The
   methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) which promoted repressed chromatin
   structure was selectively detected in synovium of diseased articular in
   rats. Overexpression of this protein results in an up-regulation of
   global methylation levels and transcriptional suppression of specific
   genes. There were increased MeCP2 and decreased secreted
   frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) in synovium as well as the FLS
   isolated from the synovium of RA rats. Knockdown of MeCP2 using siRNA
   technique enhanced SFRP4 expression in both mRNA and protein levels in
   FLS. These results indicated that epigenetic modification was involved
   in differential expression of SFRP4. To further explore the underlying
   molecular mechanisms, we hypothesized that the SFRP4 down-regulation in
   synovium was caused by DNA methylation. Treatment of FLS with DNA
   methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) blocked the cell
   proliferation and increased the SFRP4 expression. Increased SFRP4
   down-regulated the key gene beta-catenin, the downstream effectors gene
   ccnd1 and fibronectin expression in canonical Wnt pathway at the same
   time. MeCP2 and DNA methylation may provide molecular mechanisms for
   canonical Wnt pathway activation in RA. Combination of 5-azadC and MeCP2
   may be a promising treatment strategy for individuals with RA in which
   SFRP4 is inactivated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Tricin biosynthesis during growth of wheat under different abiotic
   stresses
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB In plants, O-methylation is mediated by an enzyme family of
   O-methyltransferases (OMTs) that transfer the methyl groups from the
   methyl donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to suitable phenolic
   acceptor molecules. In a previous study [1], a flavonoid OMT (TaOMT2)
   was isolated and characterized from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves.
   Its novel gene product catalyzes three sequential O-methylations of the
   flavone tricetin (5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavone) to its
   3'-monomethyl-(selgin)-->3',5'-dimethyl(tricin)-->3',4',5'-trimethyl
   (TMT) ether derivatives, with tricin being the major product of the
   reaction. In this report, the biological significance of tricetin
   methylation was investigated by measuring the OMT activity, its
   expression level, and the accumulation of its major product (tricin) at
   different stages of development of wheat plants exposed to different
   abiotic stresses such as cold, salt and drought. The results showed that
   tricin accumulates mostly in wheat inflorescences under normal
   conditions compared to leaves and other developmental stages. Tricin
   accumulation was associated with increased TaOMT2 expression level and
   its enzyme activity, suggesting a possible de novo synthesis of the
   enzyme at this important developmental stage. This phenomenon may be
   attributed to the putative role of tricin in protecting seeds against
   biotic and abiotic stresses. The functions of tricin during growth and
   development of wheat and the importance of tricetin methylation during
   abiotic stresses are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

TI Transcription forms and remodels supercoiling domains unfolding
   large-scale chromatin structures
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB DNA supercoiling is an inherent consequence of twisting DNA and is
   critical for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. However,
   DNA supercoiling at a genomic scale in human cells is uncharacterized.
   To map supercoiling, we used biotinylated trimethylpsoralen as a DNA
   structure probe to show that the human genome is organized into
   supercoiling domains. Domains are formed and remodeled by RNA polymerase
   and topoisomerase activities and are flanked by GC-AT boundaries and
   CTCF insulator protein-binding sites. Underwound domains are
   transcriptionally active and enriched in topoisomerase I, 'open'
   chromatin fibers and DNase I sites, but they are depleted of
   topoisomerase II. Furthermore, DNA supercoiling affects additional
   levels of chromatin compaction as underwound domains are cytologically
   decondensed, topologically constrained and decompacted by transcription
   of short RNAs. We suggest that supercoiling domains create a topological
   environment that facilitates gene activation, providing an evolutionary
   purpose for clustering genes along chromosomes.

TI Functional characterization of a rice de novo DNA methyltransferase,
   OsDRM2, expressed in Escherichia coli and yeast
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB DNA methylation of cytosine nucleotides is an important epigenetic
   modification that occurs in most eukaryotic organisms and is established
   and maintained by various DNA methyltransferases together with their
   co-factors. There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de
   novo and maintenance. Here, we report the isolation and functional
   characterization of a de novo methyltransferase, named OsDRM2, from rice
   (Oryza sativa L.). The full-length coding region of OsDRM2 was cloned
   and transformed into Escherichia coil and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both
   of these organisms expressed the OsDRM2 protein, which exhibited
   stochastic de novo methylation activity in vitro at CG, CHG, and CHH di-
   and tri-nucleotide patterns. Two lines of evidence demonstrated the de
   novo activity of OsDRM2: (1) a 5'-CCGG-3' containing DNA fragment that
   had been pre-treated with OsDRM2 protein expressed in E. coli was
   protected from digestion by the CG-methylation-sensitive isoschizomer
   HpaII; (2) methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis
   of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA from transformants that had been introduced
   with OsDRM2 revealed CG and CHG methylation levels of 3.92-9.12%, and
   2.88-6.93%, respectively, whereas the mock control S. cerevisiae DNA did
   not exhibit cytosine methylation. These results were further supported
   by bisulfite sequencing of the 18S rRNA and EAF5 genes of the
   transformed S. cerevisiae, which exhibited different DNA methylation
   patterns, which were observed in the genomic DNA. Our findings establish
   that OsDRM2 is an active de novo DNA methyltransferase gene with
   conserved activity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic non-host species.

TI SMARCB1 protein and mRNA loss is not caused by promoter and histone
   hypermethylation in epithelioid sarcoma
SO MODERN PATHOLOGY
AB About 10% of epithelioid sarcomas have biallelic mutation of the SMARCB1
   (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of
   chromatin, subfamily b, member 1) gene resulting in a lack of this
   nuclear protein. It has been suggested that SMARCB1 may be silenced by
   epigenetic changes in the remaining 90% of tumors. Thus, we hypothesized
   that the promoter of SMARCB1 is hypermethylated. We also examined
   SMARCB1 mRNA level to determine if a post-translational change was
   possible. Thirty-six cases of epithelioid sarcomas were studied.
   Immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis of the SMARCB1 gene were
   performed to select appropriate cases. Methylation status was assessed
   by methylation-specific PCR. Laser capture microdissection of tumor
   cells followed by real-time PCR was applied to examine the expression of
   SMARCB1 mRNA. Of 36 epithelioid sarcomas, 31 (86%) displayed a lack of
   SMARCB1 nuclear protein. In all, 4 (13%) of 31 SMARCB1-negative cases
   harbored biallelic deletion while 9 (33%) cases showed single-allelic
   deletion. One (4%) frameshift deletion of exon 3 and one point mutation
   of exon 7 were also found. In 16 (59%) cases, both alleles were intact.
   Altogether, 25/31 (81%) SMARCB1-negative cases had at least one intact
   allele. None of these cases demonstrated promoter hypermethylation. Low
   levels of SMARCB1 mRNA were found in all cases with tumor tissue
   extracted RNA (because of the minimal normal cell contamination) but no
   mRNA could be detected in laser dissected cases (containing only tumor
   cells). Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overexpression was not
   characteristic of epithelioid sarcoma. Thus, loss of SMARCB1 expression
   in epithelioid sarcoma is caused neither by DNA hypermethylation nor by
   post-translational modifications. Most likely it is the microRNA
   destruction of SMARCB1 mRNA but further investigations are needed to
   elucidate this issue. Modern Pathology (2013) 26, 393-403;

TI Gene silencing of SLC5A8 identified by genome-wide methylation profiling
   in lung cancer
SO LUNG CANCER
AB Background: Aberrant DNA hypermethylation has been implicated as a
   component of an epigenetic mechanism that silences genes in cancers.
   Methods: We performed a genome-wide search to identify differentially
   methylated loci between 26 tumor and adjacent non-tumor paired tissues
   from same lung cancer patients using restriction landmark genomic
   scanning (RLGS) analysis. Among 229 loci which were hypermethylated in
   lung tumors as compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, solute carrier
   family 5, member 8 (SLC5A8) was one of the hypermethylated genes, and
   known as a tumor suppressor gene which is silenced by epigenetic changes
   in various tumors. We investigated the significance of DNA methylation
   in SLC5A8 expression in lung cancer cell lines, and 23 paired tumor and
   adjacent non-tumor lung tissues by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR),
   quantitative methylation specific PCR (QMSP) and bisulfite modified DNA
   sequencing analyses.
   Results: Reduced or lost expression of SLC5A8 was observed in 39.1%
   (9/23) of the tumor tissues as compared with paired adjacent non-tumor
   tissues. Bisulfite sequencing results of lung cancer cell lines and
   tissues which did not express SLC5A8 showed a densely methylated
   promoter region of SLC5A8. SLC5A8 was reactivated by treatment with DNA
   methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza and/or HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A
   (TSA) in lung cancer cell lines, which did not express SLC5A8.
   Hypermethylation was detected at the promoter region of SLC5A8 in
   primary lung tumor tissues as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues
   (14/23, 60.9%).
   Conclusion These results suggest that DNA methylation in the SLC5A8
   promoter region may suppress the expression of SLC5A8 in lung tumor. (c)

TI A Ubiquitous Chromatin Opening Element Prevents Transgene Silencing in
   Pluripotent Stem Cells and Their Differentiated Progeny
SO STEM CELLS
AB Methylation-induced gene silencing represents a major obstacle to
   efficient transgene expression in pluripotent cells and thereof derived
   tissues. As ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOE) have been shown
   to prevent transgene silencing in cell lines and primary hematopoietic
   cells, we hypothesized a similar activity in pluripotent cells. This
   concept was investigated in the context of cytidine deaminase (CDD) gene
   transfer, an approach to render hematopoietic cells resistant to the
   chemotherapeutic agent Ara-C. When murine induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSC)/embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were transduced with
   self-inactivating lentiviral vectors using housekeeping (truncated
   elongation factor 1 alpha; EFS) or viral (spleen focus-forming virus;
   SFFV) promoters, incorporation of an heterogeneous nuclear
   ribonucleoproteins A2 B1/chromobox protein homolog 3 locus-derived UCOE
   (A2UCOE) significantly increased transgene expression and Ara-C
   resistance and effectively prevented silencing of the SFFV-promoter. The
   EFS promoter showed relatively stable transgene expression in naive
   iPSCs, but rapid transgene silencing was observed upon hematopoietic
   differentiation. When combined with the A2UCOE, however, the EFS
   promoter yielded stable transgene expression in 73% +/- 6% of CD41(+)
   hematopoietic progeny, markedly increased CDD expression levels, and
   significantly enhanced Ara-C resistance in clonogenic cells. Bisulfite
   sequencing revealed protection from differentiation-induced promoter CpG
   methylation to be associated with these effects. Similar transgene
   promoting activities of the A2UCOE were observed during murine
   neurogenic differentiation, in naive human pluripotent cells, and during
   nondirected multilineage differentiation of these cells. Thus, our data
   provide strong evidence that UCOEs can efficiently prevent transgene
   silencing in iPS/ESCs and their differentiated progeny and thereby
   introduce a generalized concept to circumvent differentiation-induced
   transgene silencing during the generation of advanced iPSC/ESC-based
   gene and cell therapy products. STEM CELLS 2013;31:488-499

TI Methylation status of TUSC3 is a prognostic factor in ovarian cancer
SO CANCER
AB BACKGROUND. Current prognostic information in ovarian cancer is based on
   tumor stage, tumor grade, and postoperative tumor size. Reliable
   molecular prognostic markers are scarce. In this article, the authors
   describe epigenetic events in a frequently deleted region on chromosome
   8p22 that influence the expression of tumor suppressor candidate 3
   (TUSC3), a putative tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer. METHODS.
   Messenger RNA expression and promoter hypermethylation of TUSC3 were
   studied in ovarian cancer cell lines and in tumor samples from 2 large,
   independent ovarian cancer cohorts using polymerase chain reaction-based
   methods. RESULTS. The results indicated that TUSC3 expression is
   decreased significantly because of promoter methylation in malignant
   ovarian tumors compared with benign controls. Almost 33% of ovarian
   cancer samples had detectable TUSC3 promoter methylation. Furthermore,
   methylation status of the TUSC3 promoter had a significant and
   independent influence on progression-free and overall survival.
   CONCLUSIONS. TUSC3 hypermethylation predicted progression-free and
   overall survival in ovarian cancer. The current observations suggested a
   role for N-glycosylating events in ovarian cancer pathogenesis in
   general and identified the epigenetic silencing of TUSC3 as a prognostic
   factor in this disease. Cancer 2013. (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.

TI The RdDM Pathway Is Required for Basal Heat Tolerance in Arabidopsis
SO MOLECULAR PLANT
AB This work shows that a successful heat response depends on the integrity
   of epigenetic pathways and provides evidence that heat-dependent gene
   expression is influenced by closely located transposon sequences and
   read-through transcription.Heat stress affects epigenetic gene silencing
   in Arabidopsis. To test for a mechanistic involvement of epigenetic
   regulation in heat-stress responses, we analyzed the heat tolerance of
   mutants defective in DNA methylation, histone modifications,
   chromatin-remodeling, or siRNA-based silencing pathways. Plants
   deficient in NRPD2, the common second-largest subunit of RNA polymerases
   IV and V, and in the Rpd3-type histone deacetylase HDA6 were
   hypersensitive to heat exposure. Microarray analysis demonstrated that
   NRPD2 and HDA6 have independent roles in transcriptional reprogramming
   in response to temperature stress. The misexpression of protein-coding
   genes in nrpd2 mutants recovering from heat correlated with defective
   epigenetic regulation of adjacent transposon remnants which involved the
   loss of control of heat-stress-induced read-through transcription. We
   provide evidence that the transcriptional response to temperature
   stress, at least partially, relies on the integrity of the RNA-dependent
   DNA methylation pathway.

TI RTN4IP1 Is Down-Regulated in Thyroid Cancer and Has Tumor-Suppressive
   Function
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Previously we identified RTN4IP1 to be differentially expressed
   in thyroid cancer by sex and the gene is located on chromosome 6q21, a
   chromosomal region frequently deleted or with loss of heterozygosity in
   a variety of human malignancies including thyroid cancer.
   Objective: Because the expression and function of this gene is unknown,
   we sought to characterize its expression in normal, hyperplastic, and
   benign and malignant thyroid tissue samples and to evaluate its function
   in cancer cells.
   Design: RTN4IP1 expression was analyzed in normal and hyperplastic
   thyroid tissue and benign and malignant thyroid tissue samples. In 3
   thyroid cancer cell lines (TPC1 from a papillary thyroid cancer, FTC133
   from a follicular thyroid cancer, XTC1 from a Hurthle cell carcinoma),
   small interfering RNA knockdown of RTN4IP1 was used to determine its
   role in regulating the hallmarks of malignant cell phenotype (cellular
   proliferation, migration, apoptosis, invasion, tumor spheroid formation,
   anchorage independent growth).
   Results: We found RTN4IP1 mRNA expression was significantly down-
   regulated in follicular and papillary thyroid cancer as compared with
   normal, hyperplastic, and benign thyroid neoplasms (P < .05). Moreover,
   RTN4IP1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in larger papillary
   thyroid cancers (P < .05). Small interfering RNA knockdown of RTN4IP1
   expression increased cellular proliferation (2- to 4-fold) in all 3 of
   the cell lines tested and increased cellular invasion (1.5- to 3-fold)
   and migration (2- to 7.5-fold), colony formation (3- to 6-fold), and
   tumor spheroid formation (P < .05) in 2 of the 3 cell lines tested
   (FTC-133 and XTC1).
   Conclusions: This is the first study to characterize the expression and
   function of RTN4IP1 in cancer. Our results demonstrate RTN4IP1 is down-
   regulated in thyroid cancer and is associated with larger papillary
   thyroid cancer and that it regulates malignant cell phenotype. These
   findings, taken together, suggest that RTN4IP1 has a tumor-suppressive
   function and may regulate thyroid cancer progression. (J Clin Endocrinol

TI IL-1 beta and TSH disturb thyroid epithelium integrity in autoimmune
   thyroid diseases
SO IMMUNOBIOLOGY
AB Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta and TNF alpha are known to
   affect thyroid function. They stimulate IL-6 secretion and modify
   epithelium integrity by altering junction proteins. To study the role of
   cytokines on thyroid epithelia tightness in autoimmune thyroid diseases
   (AITD), we analyzed the expression profiles of junction proteins (ZO-1,
   Claudin, JAM-A) and cytokines in human thyroid slices and also
   investigated the effect of IL-1 beta on the epithelium integrity in
   primary cultures of human thyrocytes. Junction proteins expression
   (ZO-1, Claudin, JAM-A) has been analyzed by immunohistochemistry on
   thyroid slices and by Western blot on membrane proteins extracted from
   thyrocytes of patients suffering from Graves and Hashimoto diseases. The
   high expression of junction proteins we found on Graves' disease thyroid
   slices as well as in cell membrane extracts acknowledges the tightness
   of thyroid follicular cells in this AITD. In contrast, the reduced
   expression of JAM and ZO-1 in thyroid cells from patients suffering from
   Hashimoto thyroiditis is in agreement with the loss of thyroid
   follicular cell integrity that occurs in this pathology. Concerning the
   effects on epithelium integrity of TSH and of the pro-inflammatory
   cytokine IL-1 beta in primary cultures of human thyroid cells, TSH
   appeared able to modify JAM-A localization but without any change in the
   expression levels of JAM-A, Claudin and ZO-1. Inversely, IL-1 beta
   provoked a decrease in the expression of-and a redistribution of both,
   Claudin and ZO-1 without modifying the expression and sub-cellular
   distribution patterns of JAM-A in thyroid cells. These results
   demonstrate (i) that Hashimoto's-and Graves' diseases display different
   junction proteins expression patterns with a loss of epithelium
   integrity in the former and (ii) that IL-1 beta modifies thyroid
   epithelial tightness of human thyrocytes by altering the expression and
   localization of junction proteins. Therefore, IL-1 beta could play a
   role in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Variations in genomic DNA methylation during the long-term in vitro
   proliferation of oil palm embryogenic suspension cultures
SO PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB The long-term proliferation of embryogenic cell suspensions of oil palm
   is associated with changes in both genomic methylation rates and
   embryogenic capacities.
   In the aim of exploring the relationship between epigenetic stability
   and the long-term in vitro proliferation of plant tissues, we have
   studied changes in genomic DNA methylation levels in embryogenic
   suspensions of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). Five embryogenic
   callus lines were obtained from selected hybrid seeds and then
   proliferated as suspension cultures. Each clonal line obtained from a
   single genotype was subdivided into three independent subclonal lines.
   Once established, cultures proliferated for 12 months and genomic DNA
   was sampled at 4 months intervals for the estimation of global DNA
   methylation rates through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
   quantitation of deoxynucleosides. Our results show that in vitro
   proliferation induces DNA hypermethylation in a time-dependent fashion.
   Moreover, this trend is statistically significant in several clonal
   lines and shared between subclonal lines originating from the same
   genotype. Interestingly, the only clonal line undergoing loss of genomic
   methylation in the course of proliferation has been found unable to
   generate somatic embryos. We discuss the possible implications of
   genome-wide DNA methylation changes in proliferating cells with a view
   to the maintenance of genomic and epigenomic stability.

TI Histone Methylation Defines an Epigenetic Entity in Penile Squamous Cell
   Carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Purpose: Earlier studies indicate that epigenetics contribute to the
   pathogenesis of penile squamous cell carcinoma. Histone methylation
   patterns are frequently altered during carcinogenesis. Therefore, we
   investigated the methylation pattern of the histones H3K4, H3K9 and
   H3K27 in penile carcinoma and normal tissue.
   Materials and Methods: A tissue microarray was constructed with 65
   penile carcinomas, 6 metastatic lesions and 30 control tissues. Global
   histone methylation was assessed using immunohistochemistry.
   Results: Global levels of H3K4me1, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K27me2 and
   H3K27me3 were decreased, whereas H3K9me3 was increased in penile
   carcinoma. Histone methylation levels defined an epigenetic entity that
   allowed accurate differentiation of cancer and normal samples. We
   observed no correlation of histone methylation levels with
   clinicopathological parameters or patient outcome.
   Conclusions: The description of a definite epigenetic entity in penile
   carcinoma provides a rationale for testing epigenetic agents in patients
   with metastatic disease.

TI Nitric oxide signaling differentially affects habitat choice by two
   larval morphs of the sea slug Alderia willowi: mechanistic insight into
   evolutionary transitions in dispersal strategies
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB In many marine animals, adult habitat is selected by lecithotrophic
   (non-feeding) larvae with a limited lifespan. In generalist species,
   larvae may increasingly accept sub-optimal habitat over time as energy
   stores are depleted ('desperate larva' hypothesis). If the fitness cost
   of suboptimal habitat is too high, larvae of specialists may prolong the
   searching phase until they encounter a high-quality patch or die ('death
   before dishonor' hypothesis). In generalists, starvation is hypothesized
   to lead to a decline in inhibitory nitric oxide (NO) signaling, thereby
   triggering metamorphosis. Here, we document alternative functions for
   identified signaling pathways in larvae having. 'desperate' versus.
   death before dishonor' strategies in lecithotrophic clutches of a
   habitat specialist, the sea slug Alderia willowi. In an unusual
   dimorphism, each clutch of A. willowi hatches both non-selective larvae
   that settle soon after hatching and siblings that delay settlement in
   the absence of cues from the alga Vaucheria, the sole adult food.
   Pharmacological manipulation of NO signaling induced metamorphosis in
   non-selective but not selective stages. However, decreased NO signaling
   in selective larvae lowered the threshold for response to habitat cues,
   mimicking the effect of declining energy levels. Manipulation of cGMP or
   dopamine production induced metamorphosis in selective and non-selective
   larvae alike, highlighting a distinct role for the NO pathway in the two
   larval morphs. We propose a model in which NO production (1) links
   nitrogen metabolism with sensory receptor signaling, and (2) shifts from
   a regulatory role in. 'desperate larva' strategies to a modulatory role
   in 'death before dishonor' strategies. This study provides new
   mechanistic insight into how the function of conserved signaling
   pathways may change in response to selection on larval habitat choice
   behaviors.

TI Chronic effects of corticosterone on GIRK1-3 subunits and 5-HT1A
   receptor expression in rat brain and their reversal by concurrent
   fluoxetine treatment
SO EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Dysregulation of the serotonergic system and abnormalities of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis have been demonstrated in major
   depression. Animal studies indicate that 5-HT1A receptor expression may
   be reduced by long-term administration of corticosterone. However,
   similar studies on the regulation of GIRK channels, one of the most
   important effectors of the neuronal 5-HT1A. receptor, are limited. In
   order to address these issues, slow-release corticosterone pellets were
   implanted subcutaneously to adrenal intact male rats (200 mg pellets, 35
   days release). Starting on day 15, animals were treated for 21 days with
   fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.), or vehicle. Using in situ hybridization
   histochemistry and receptor autoradiography, we found that chronic
   corticosterone treatment was accompanied by a significant decrease on
   the mRNAs coding for mineralocorticoid receptors in hippocampal areas.
   Under these conditions, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression decreased in
   dorsal raphe nucleus and dentate gyrus. However, 5-HT1A receptor levels,
   as measured by [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding, diminished significantly only in
   dentate gyrus. It is noteworthy that chronic treatment with fluoxetine
   reversed the alterations on 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels only in dorsal
   raphe. Finally, chronic corticosterone treatment produced an increase on
   the mRNA coding for the GIRK2 subunit in several hypothalamic and
   thalamic areas, which was reversed by fluoxetine. Measurements of cell
   density and volume of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus did not
   reveal significant changes after corticosterone or corticosterone plus
   fluoxetine treatments. These data are relevant for a better
   understanding of the differential regulation of pre- and postsynaptic
   5-HT1A receptors by corticosterone flattened rhythm. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Diabetes Mellitus Increases Reactive Oxygen Species Production in the
   Thyroid of Male Rats
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Diabetes mellitus (DM) disrupts the pituitary-thyroid axis and leads to
   a higher prevalence of thyroid disease. However, the role of reactive
   oxygen species in DM thyroid disease pathogenesis is unknown. Dual
   oxidases (DUOX) is responsible for H(2)O(2) production, which is a
   cosubstrate for thyroperoxidase, but the accumulation of H(2)O(2) also
   causes cellular deleterious effects. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
   phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) is another member of the nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide phosphate oxidase family expressed in the thyroid.
   Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the thyroid DUOX activity and expression
   in DM rats in addition to NOX4 expression. In the thyroids of the DM
   rats, we found increased H(2)O(2) generation due to higher DUOX protein
   content and DUOX1, DUOX2, and NOX4 mRNA expressions. In rat thyroid
   PCCL3 cells, both TSH and insulin decreased DUOX activity and DUOX1 mRNA
   levels, an effect partially reversed by protein kinase A inhibition.
   Most antioxidant enzymes remained unchanged or decreased in the thyroid
   of DM rats, whereas only glutathione peroxidase 3 was increased. DUOX1
   and NOX4 expression and H(2)O(2) production were significantly higher in
   cells cultivated with high glucose, which was reversed by protein kinase
   C inhibition. We conclude that thyroid reactive oxygen species is
   elevated in experimental rat DM, which is a consequence of low-serum TSH
   and insulin but is also related to hyperglycemia per se. (Endocrinology

TI DNA methylation profiling of medulloblastoma allows robust
   subclassification and improved outcome prediction using formalin-fixed
   biopsies
SO ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB Molecular subclassification is rapidly informing the clinical management
   of medulloblastoma. However, the disease remains associated with poor
   outcomes and therapy-associated late effects, and the majority of
   patients are not characterized by a validated prognostic biomarker.
   Here, we investigated the potential of epigenetic DNA methylation for
   disease subclassification, particularly in formalin-fixed biopsies, and
   to identify biomarkers for improved therapeutic individualization. Tumor
   DNA methylation profiles were assessed, alongside molecular and clinical
   disease features, in 230 patients primarily from the SIOP-UKCCSG PNET3
   clinical trial. We demonstrate by cross-validation in frozen training
   and formalin-fixed test sets that medulloblastoma comprises four robust
   DNA methylation subgroups (termed WNT, SHH, G3 and G4), highly related
   to their transcriptomic counterparts, and which display distinct
   molecular, clinical and pathological disease characteristics. WNT
   patients displayed an expected favorable prognosis, while outcomes for
   SHH, G3 and G4 were equivalent in our cohort. MXI1 and IL8 methylation
   were identified as novel independent high-risk biomarkers in
   cross-validated survival models of non-WNT patients, and were validated
   using non-array methods. Incorporation of MXI1 and IL8 into current
   survival models significantly improved the assignment of disease risk;
   46 % of patients could be classified as 'favorable risk' (> 90 %
   survival) compared to 13 % using current models, while the high-risk
   group was reduced from 30 to 16 %. DNA methylation profiling enables the
   robust subclassification of four disease subgroups in frozen and
   routinely collected/archival formalin-fixed biopsy material, and the
   incorporation of DNA methylation biomarkers can significantly improve
   disease-risk stratification. These findings have important implications
   for future risk-adapted clinical disease management.

TI Frequent concomitant epigenetic silencing of SOX1 and secreted
   frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) in human hepatocellular carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
AB Background and Aim: Except for genetic mutations, epigenetic changes are
   also involved in the development of human cancers. Recently, we have
   identified SOX1, SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 1, is
   hypermethylated in cervical cancer and ovarian cancer. Therefore, we
   investigated whether promoter hypermethylation of SOX1 is common in
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Methods: We used methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR)
   and bisulfite sequencing to analyze the methyaltion level of the SOX1
   promoter in seven HCC cell lines, 54 clinical HCCs, 42 cirrhotic livers,
   21 livers with chronic hepatitis, and 15 control livers. Then, we
   employed quantitative MS-PCR (QMSP) to validate in an independent set of
   samples (60 paired HCCs and 30 control livers). Finally, we used
   luciferase reporter and colony formation assay to check the effect of
   SOX1 in HCC.
   Results: Promoter methylation of SOX1 was significantly frequent in HCC
   cell lines and clinical HCCs, cirrhotic livers, but not in control
   livers (P < 0.0001). There is a significant correlation between
   downregulation of SOX1 expression and promoter methylation. QMSP results
   confirmed that promoter hypermethylation of SOX1 is significantly more
   frequent in HCCs than control livers (P < 0.0001). The frequency of SOX1
   methylation in patients with secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs)
   methylation is significantly higher than in patients without SFRPs
   methylation (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOX1 could
   suppress T-cell factor-dependent transcriptional activity and colony
   formation number in HCCs.
   Conclusions: Concomitant epigenetic silencing of SOX1 and SFRPs through
   promoter hypermethylation is frequent in HCCs, and this might contribute
   to abnormal activation of canonical Wnt signal pathway.

TI Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and expression of the
   maltase-glucoamylase gene are reduced by dietary resistant starch
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (K4) is associated with euchromatin
   and is involved in the transactivation of genes. However, it is unknown
   whether histone methylation is involved with changes in gene expression
   induced by nutrients. In this study, we examined whether methylations of
   histone H3 at K4 on maltase-glucoamylase (Mgam), which is responsible
   for the digestion of starch in the small intestine, as well as Mgam
   expression were altered by feeding rats an indigestible starch
   (resistant starch, RS). The mRNA and protein levels and the activities
   of MGAM were reduced in rats fed an RS diet compared with those fed a
   regular starch diet. Furthermore, we found that decreases in di- and
   tri-methylation of histone H3 at K4, as well as reduced acetylation of
   histones H3 and H4 on the Mgam gene were associated with a reduction of
   Mgam gene expression. These results suggest that the reductions of
   jejunal MGAM levels and activities caused by the RS diet are regulated
   at the mRNA level through a decrease in methylation of histone H3 at K4
   and reduced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on the Mgam gene. (c) 2013

TI The Role of the Arabidopsis Exosome in siRNA-Independent Silencing of
   Heterochromatic Loci
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB The exosome functions throughout eukaryotic RNA metabolism and has a
   prominent role in gene silencing in yeast. In Arabidopsis, exosome
   regulates expression of a "hidden" transcriptome layer from centromeric,
   pericentromeric, and other heterochromatic loci that are also controlled
   by small (sm) RNA-based de novo DNA methylation (RdDM). However, the
   relationship between exosome and smRNAs in gene silencing in Arabidopsis
   remains unexplored. To investigate whether exosome interacts with RdDM,
   we profiled Arabidopsis smRNAs by deep sequencing in exosome and RdDM
   mutants and also analyzed RdDM-controlled loci. We found that exosome
   loss had a very minor effect on global smRNA populations, suggesting
   that, in contrast to fission yeast, in Arabidopsis the exosome does not
   control the spurious entry of RNAs into smRNA pathways. Exosome defects
   resulted in decreased histone H3K9 dimethylation at RdDM-controlled
   loci, without affecting smRNAs or DNA methylation. Exosome also exhibits
   a strong genetic interaction with RNA Pol V, but not Pol IV, and
   physically associates with transcripts produced from the scaffold RNAs
   generating region. We also show that two Arabidopsis rrp6 homologues act
   in gene silencing. Our data suggest that Arabidopsis exosome may act in
   parallel with RdDM in gene silencing, by epigenetic effects on chromatin
   structure, not through siRNAs or DNA methylation.

TI A chromatin link to caste identity in the carpenter ant Camponotus
   floridanus
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB In many ant species, sibling larvae follow alternative ontogenetic
   trajectories that generate striking variation in morphology and behavior
   among adults. These organism-level outcomes are often determined by
   environmental rather than genetic factors. Therefore, epigenetic
   mechanisms may mediate the expression of adult polyphenisms. We produced
   the first genome-wide maps of chromatin structure in a eusocial insect
   and found that gene-proximal changes in histone modifications, notably
   H3K27 acetylation, discriminate two female worker and male castes in
   Camponotus floridanus ants and partially explain differential gene
   expression between castes. Genes showing coordinated changes in H3K27ac
   and RNA implicate muscle development, neuronal regulation, and sensory
   responses in modulating caste identity. Binding sites of the
   acetyltransferase CBP harbor the greatest caste variation in H3K27ac,
   are enriched with motifs for conserved transcription factors, and show
   evolutionary expansion near developmental and neuronal genes. These
   results suggest that environmental effects on caste identity may be
   mediated by differential recruitment of CBP to chromatin. We propose
   that epigenetic mechanisms that modify chromatin structure may help
   orchestrate the generation and maintenance of polyphenic caste
   morphology and social behavior in ants.

TI DNA methylation: roles in mammalian development
SO NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS
AB DNA methylation is among the best studied epigenetic modifications and
   is essential to mammalian development. Although the methylation status
   of most CpG dinucteotides in the genome is stably propagated through
   mitosis, improvements to methods for measuring methylation have
   identified numerous regions in which it is dynamically regulated. In
   this Review, we discuss key concepts in the function of DNA methylation
   in mammals, stemming from more than two decades of research, including
   many recent studies that have elucidated when and where DNA methylation
   has a regulatory role in the genome. We include insights from early
   development, embryonic stem cells and adult Lineages, particularly
   haematopoiesis, to highlight the general features of this modification
   as it participates in both global and localized epigenetic regulation..

TI Thyroid hormone deiodinase type 2 mRNA levels in sea lamprey (Petromyzon
   marinus) are regulated during metamorphosis and in response to a thyroid
   challenge
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Thyroid hormones (THs) are crucial for normal vertebrate development and
   are the one obligate morphogen that drives amphibian metamorphosis.
   However, contrary to other metamorphosing vertebrates, lampreys exhibit
   a sharp drop in serum TH early in metamorphosis, and anti-thyroid agents
   such as potassium perchlorate (KClO(4)) induce metamorphosis. The type 2
   deiodinase (D2) enzyme is a key regulator of TH availability during
   amphibian metamorphosis. We set out to determine how D2 may be involved
   in the regulation of lamprey metamorphosis and thyroid homeostasis. We
   cloned a 1.8 Kb Petromyzon marinus D2 cDNA that includes the entire
   protein coding region and a selenocysteine (Sec) codon. Northern
   blotting indicated that the lamprey D2 mRNA is the longest reported to
   date (>9 Kb). Using real-time PCR, we showed that intestinal and hepatic
   D2 mRNA levels were elevated prior to and during the early stages of
   metamorphosis and then declined dramatically to low levels that were
   sustained for the remainder of metamorphosis. These data are consistent
   with previously reported changes in serum TH levels and deiodinase
   activity. Treatment of larvae with either TH or KClO(4) significantly
   affected D2 mRNA levels in the intestine and liver. These D2 mRNA levels
   during metamorphosis and in response to thyroid challenges suggest that
   D2 may function in the regulation of TH levels during lamprey
   metamorphosis and the maintenance of TH homeostasis. (C) 2013 Elsevier

TI PRMT4 Is a Novel Coactivator of c-Myb-Dependent Transcription in
   Haematopoietic Cell Lines
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4)-dependent methylation of
   arginine residues in histones and other chromatin-associated proteins
   plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. However,
   the exact mechanism of how PRMT4 activates transcription remains
   elusive. Here, we identify the chromatin remodeller Mi2 alpha as a novel
   interaction partner of PRMT4. PRMT4 binds Mi2 alpha and its close
   relative Mi2 beta, but not the other components of the repressive
   Mi2-containing NuRD complex. In the search for the biological role of
   this interaction, we find that PRMT4 and Mi2 alpha/beta interact with
   the transcription factor c-Myb and cooperatively coactivate c-Myb target
   gene expression in haematopoietic cell lines. This coactivation requires
   the methyltransferase and ATPase activity of PRMT4 and Mi2,
   respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that c-Myb
   target genes are direct transcriptional targets of PRMT4 and Mi2.
   Knockdown of PRMT4 or Mi2 alpha/beta in haematopoietic cells of the
   erythroid lineage results in diminished transcriptional induction of
   c-Myb target genes, attenuated cell growth and survival, and deregulated
   differentiation resembling the effects caused by c-Myb depletion. These
   findings reveal an important and so far unknown connection between PRMT4
   and the chromatin remodeller Mi2 in c-Myb signalling.

TI Acetylation limits 53BP1 association with damaged chromatin to promote
   homologous recombination
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The pathogenic sequelae of BRCA1 mutation in human and mouse cells are
   mitigated by concomitant deletion of 538P1, which binds histone H4
   dimethylated at Lys20 (H4K2Ome2) to promote nonhomologous end joining,
   suggesting that a balance between BRCA1 and 53BP1 regulates DNA double
   strand break (DSB) repair mechanism choice. Here we document that
   acetylation is a key determinant of this balance. TIP60
   acetyltransferase deficiency reduced BRCA1 at DSB chromatin with
   commensurate increases in 53BP1, whereas HDAC inhibition yielded the
   opposite effect. TIP60-dependent H4 acetylation diminished 53BP1 binding
   to H4K2Ome2 in part through disruption of a salt bridge between H4K16
   and Glu1551 in the 53BP1 Tudor domain. Moreover, TIP60 deficiency
   impaired homologous recombination and conferred sensitivity to PARP
   inhibition in a 53BP1-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that
   acetylation in cis to H4K2Ome2 regulates relative BRCA1 and 53BP1 DSB
   chromatin occupancy to direct DNA repair mechanism.

TI Elevated corticosterone levels and severe weather conditions decrease
   parental investment of incubating Adelie penguins
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Corticosterone, the main stress hormone in birds, mediates resource
   allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to
   changes in the environment. Incubation is a time and energy-consuming
   phase of the avian reproductive cycle. It may be terminated prematurely,
   when the parents' energy stores are depleted or when environmental
   conditions are severe. In this study, the effects of experimentally
   elevated baseline corticosterone levels on the parental investment of
   incubating male Adelie penguins were investigated. Incubation duration
   and reproductive success of 60 penguins were recorded. The clutches of
   some birds were replaced by dummy eggs, which recorded egg temperatures
   and rotation rates, enabling a detailed investigation of incubation
   behaviour. Corticosterone levels of treated birds were 2.4-fold higher
   than those of controls 18 days post treatment. Exogenous corticosterone
   triggered nest desertion in 61% of the treated birds; consequently
   reducing reproductive success, indicating that corticosterone can reduce
   or disrupt parental investment. Regarding egg temperatures, hypothermic
   events became more frequent and more pronounced in treated birds, before
   these birds eventually abandoned their nest. The treatment also
   significantly decreased incubation temperatures by 1.3 degrees C and
   lengthened the incubation period by 2.1 days. However, the number of
   chicks at hatching was similar among successful nests, regardless of
   treatment. Weather conditions appeared to be particularly important in
   determining the extent to which corticosterone levels affected the
   behaviour of penguins, as treated penguins were more sensitive to severe
   weather conditions. This underlines the importance of considering the
   interactions of organisms with their environment in studies of animal
   behaviour and ecophysiology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of Whole-Genome DNA Methylation Patterns in Whole Blood,
   Saliva, and Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines
SO BEHAVIOR GENETICS
AB Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, that underlie
   neuropsychiatric conditions have become a promising area of research.
   Most commonly used DNA sources in such studies are peripheral (whole)
   blood (WB), saliva (SL), and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); thus, the
   question of the consistency of DNA methylation patterns in those cells
   is of particular interest. To investigate this question we performed
   comparative analyses of methylation patterns in WB, SL, and LCLs derived
   from the same individuals, using Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip
   arrays. Our results showed that DNA methylation patterns in SL are
   relatively consistent with those in WB, whereas the patterns in LCLs are
   similarly distinct from both WB and SL. The results indicated that due
   to multiple random and directed changes in DNA methylation throughout
   cell culturing, LCLs are not a reliable source of DNA for epigenetic
   studies and should be used with caution when investigating epigenetic
   mechanisms underlying biological processes.

TI H19 gene methylation study in Indian buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)
SO VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB The methylation of DNA at cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides is
   associated with transcriptional repression and is implicated in
   maintaining genomic stability and also the silencing of repetitive
   elements. These imprinted genes are unique as they are expressed
   exclusively from one parental allele. The present study was carried out
   to detect methylation status in H19 gene promoter CTCF III region in
   three Indian buffalo breeds (Jaffarabadi, Surti and Mehsani) by
   bisulfite sequencing. Methylation percent in Jaffarabadi, Surti and
   Mehsani buffaloes were found to be 50.19, 70.85 and 52.24, respectively,
   with mean incidence of methylation percent in H19 in all three breeds as
   57.36. Apart from CpG methylation, unexpected nucleotide conversion (T >
   C, A > G, G > A) and deletion (A and G) after bisulfite sequencing were
   also observed. We observed no significant relationships in milk yield
   and milk fat per cent with methylation pattern in H19 gene in any of the
   three breeds.

TI Dynamic DNA methylation across diverse human cell lines and tissues
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB As studies of DNA methylation increase in scope, it has become evident
   that methylation has a complex relationship with gene expression, plays
   an important role in defining cell types, and is disrupted in many
   diseases. We describe large-scale single-base resolution DNA methylation
   profiling on a diverse collection of 82 human cell lines and tissues
   using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Analysis
   integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data illuminates the functional role of
   this dynamic mark. Loci that are hypermethylated across cancer types are
   enriched for sites bound by NANOG in embryonic stem cells, which
   supports and expands the model of a stem/progenitor cell signature in
   cancer. CpGs that are hypomethylated across cancer types are
   concentrated in megabase-scale domains that occur near the telomeres and
   centromeres of chromosomes, are depleted of genes, and are enriched for
   cancer-specific EZH2 binding and H3K27me3 (repressive chromatin). In
   noncancer samples, there are cell-type specific methylation signatures
   preserved in primary cell lines and tissues as well as methylation
   differences induced by cell culture. The relationship between
   methylation and expression is context-dependent, and we find that
   CpG-rich enhancers bound by EP300 in the bodies of expressed genes are
   unmethylated despite the dense gene-body methylation surrounding them.
   Non-CpG cytosine methylation occurs in human somatic tissue, is
   particularly prevalent in brain tissue, and is reproducible across many
   individuals. This study provides an atlas of DNA methylation across
   diverse and well-characterized samples and enables new discoveries about
   DNA methylation and its role in gene regulation and disease.

TI Association between DNA methylation of HSPB1 and death in low Gleason
   score prostate cancer
SO PROSTATE CANCER AND PROSTATIC DISEASES
AB BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp-27) encoded by gene HSPB1 is a
   critical regulator of the behavioral phenotype of human prostate cancer
   (PCa) cells, enhanced expression being associated with highly aggressive
   disease and poor clinical outcome. In contrast, the protein is not
   expressed in PCas of low malignant potential. To gain insight into the
   mechanism regulating its expression, we tested the hypothesis that
   differential methylation of CpG islands within HSPB1 controls
   transcription and subsequent translation of the gene.
   METHODS: We studied prostate epithelial cell lines and tissue biopsies,
   including 59 BPH and 415 PCas, of which 367 were a cohort of men with up
   to 20 years of follow-up. Methylation across the gene (DNA methylation
   (DNAme)) was assayed by pyrosequencing. Hsp-27 expression was assessed
   by western blot and immunohistochemistry.
   RESULTS: In cancer tissues, methylation increased in a 30 direction
   (P<0.0001) whereas in benign hyperplasia methylation was constantly
   below 5%, a cutoff giving a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 50%.
   Although methylation of the promoter region was significantly
   discriminating between benign and malignant prostatic epithelia, it
   compared poorly with methylation of the first intron. The prognostic
   value of HSPB1 DNAme was confirmed by both univariate (hazard ratio 1.77
   per 50% increment, P = 0.02) and multivariate models. Interaction
   between HSPB1 methylation and Gleason score revealed high DNAme to be a
   reliable prognostic marker of poor outcome in men with low Gleason score
   (P = 0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate CpG methylation of the first HSPB1 intron
   to be an important biomarker that identifies aggressive PCas otherwise
   regarded as low risk by current clinical criteria but that,
   biologically, require immediate active management. Prostate Cancer and

TI Effect of corticosterone on growth and welfare of broiler chickens

SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Tonic immobility (TI) test is commonly used to assess fear. Animals
   showing different TI durations demonstrate distinct behavior and
   biochemical responses to stress. However, less is known about how TI
   phenotype affects growth and welfare of domestic fowl. In this study,
   broiler chickens (Gallus gallus) were classified into short and long TI
   duration (STI and LTI) phenotypes and treated chronically with vehicle
   (CON) or corticosterone (CORT). STI broilers demonstrated significantly
   higher growth rate with higher breast muscle yield (P<0.05) and liver
   weight relative to BW tended to be lower (P=0.053), which was
   accompanied by higher serum concentration of CURT (P<0.05) and uric acid
   (P<0.01), but lower serum level of T4 (P=0.01). CORT severely reduced
   body weight, as well as the relative weight of muscle, bursa of
   Fabricius and spleen (P<0.001), but relative liver weight was increased
   (P<0.001). CORT-treated chickens had reduced serum CORT, elevated
   heterophile/lymphocyte ratio, and increased serum levels of total and
   free T3. STI broilers displayed more preening behavior (P<0.05), yet
   CORT elicited more walking behavior (P<0.05). No difference was observed
   in the welfare assessment scores between STI and LTI phenotypes under
   basal situation, while LTI chickens showed significantly increased
   incidence of pad dermatitis compared to STI under CORT exposure. The
   results suggest that STI broilers demonstrate better growth performance
   and higher adaptability to stress compared to LTI chickens. (C) 2013

   levels of 12 members of histone-related chromatin modifier genes.
   Histone H4 hypoacetylation was detected both in eutopic and ectopic
   endometrium. There were no difference between patients with
   endometriosis and controls on global levels of H3 acetylation.
   Furthermore, global histone H3K4 hypomethylation and H3K9
   hypomethylation were detected both in ectopic and eutopic endometrium (p
   < 0.001), and in ectopic endometrium (p < 0.001), respectively. SIRT1
   mRNA level was significantly decreased in eutopic endometrium, while
   mRNA levels of HDAC1, SUV39H1, SUV39H2 and G9a were significantly
   downregulated in ectopic endometrium. HDAC2 mRNA level was significantly
   increased in eutopic endometrium. PCAF mRNA level was significantly
   increased in ectopic endometrium.
   Aberrant histone modification may play an important role in the

   available on DNA methylation affected by male sterile cytoplasm in
   hybrid rice. We used a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism
   technique to characterize DNA methylation in four male sterile

   the B lines, while b2 was fully methylated only in all the A lines.
   These results implied a relationship of DNA methylation at these sites
   specifically with male sterile cytoplasms, as well as male sterility,
   since the only difference between the A and B lines was the cytoplasm.
   The DNA methylation was markedly affected by male sterile cytoplasms.
   WA-type and Yinshui-type cytoplasms affected the methylation to a much
   greater degree than G-type and D-type cytoplasms, as indicated by the
   number and degree of methylated sites, ratio of methylated sites, number
   of fully methylated sites, ratio of fully methylated sites, and
   polymorphism between A and B lines for these cytoplasms. The genetic
   distance between the cytoplasm and nucleus for the WA-type is much
   greater than for G- and D-types because the former is between wild and
   cultivated species and the latter is within indica subspecies between
   African and Asian cultivars. This difference in genetic distance may be
   responsible for the variation in methylation which we observed.

TI Electrochemical biosensing method for the detection of DNA methylation
   and assay of the methyltransferase activity
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB In this article, we presented an electrochemical method for detection of
   DNA methylation and assay of DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity
   using methylene blue (MB) as electrochemical indicator. After the DNA
   hybrid was methylated by T.aqI MTase, it could not be cleaved by HincII
   endonuclease. On the contrary, the double DNA without methylation could
   be cleaved, which would decrease the amount of intercalated MB. Thus,
   the DNA methylation status and MTase activity could be determinated
   based on the voltammetric signal change of MB. The methylation site
   could be found based on this method. The electrochemical signal of MB
   increased linearly with increasing T.aqI MTase concentration from 0.1 to
   100 U/mL. Moreover, the inhibition investigation demonstrated that
   fisetin could inhibit the T.aqI MTase activity with the IC(50) value of
   280 mu M. Therefore, the screening of the inhibitors of MTase could be
   accomplished using the novel method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI C2-mediated decrease in DNA methylation, accumulation of siRNAs, and
   increase in expression for genes involved in defense pathways in plants
   infected with beet severe curly top virus
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB Cytosine methylation is one of epigenetic information marked on the DNA
   sequence. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) target homologous
   genomic DNA sequences for cytosine methylation. This process, known as
   RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), plays an important role in
   transposon control, regulation of gene expression and virus resistance.
   In this paper, we demonstrate that the C2 protein encoded by a
   geminivirus (beet severe curly top virus, BSCTV) mediated a decrease in
   DNA methylation of repeat regions in the promoters of ACD6, an upstream
   regulator of the salicylic acid defense pathway, and GSTF14, an
   endogenous gene of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily that is
   implicated in numerous stress responses. C2-mediated decreases in DNA
   methylation reduced accumulation of the siRNAs derived from the promoter
   repeats and enhanced the steady-state expression of both ACD6 and GSTF14
   transcripts. Reduced accumulation of BSCTV-derived siRNAs was detected
   in BSCTV-infected plants, but not in plants infected with C2-deficient
   BSCTV (c2BSCTV). C2 protein exhibited no siRNA-binding activity.
   Instead, our results revealed that C2 protein-mediated decreases in DNA
   methylation appeared to affect the production of siRNAs that are
   required for targeting and reinforcing RdDM, a process that activated
   expression of defense-related genes that are normally dampened by these
   siRNAs in the host plants. However, C2-dependent reduction in
   virus-derived siRNAs also benefits the viruses by disrupting the
   feedback loop reinforcing DNA methylation-mediated antiviral silencing.

TI Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in alcohol dependence
SO ADDICTION BIOLOGY
AB Genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors influence the development
   of alcohol dependence (AD). Recent studies have shown that DNA
   methylation markers in peripheral blood may serve as risk markers for
   AD. Yet a genome-wide epigenomic approach investigating the role of DNA
   methylation in AD has yet to be performed. We conducted a
   population-based, case-control study of genome-wide DNA methylation to
   determine if alterations in gene-specific methylation were associated
   with AD in a Chinese population. Using the Illumina Infinium Human
   Methylation27 BeadChip, we assessed gene-specific methylation in over
   27000 CpG sites from DNA isolated from lymphocytes in 63 male AD
   in-patients and 65 male healthy controls. Using a multi-factorial
   statistical model, we observed differential methylation between cases
   and controls at multiple CpG sites with the majority of the methylated
   CpG sites being hypomethylated. Analyses with the online gene set
   analysis toolkit WebGestalt revealed that the genes of interest were
   enriched in multiple biological processes involved in AD development.
   Gene Ontology function annotation showed that stress, immune response
   and signal transduction were highly associated with AD. Further analysis
   by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes revealed associations
   with multiple pathways involved in metabolism through cytochrome P450,
   cytokinecytokine receptor interaction and calcium signaling.
   Associations with canonical pathways previously shown to be involved in
   AD were also observed, such as dehydrogenases 1A (ADH1A), ADH7, aldehyde
   dehydrogenases 3B2 (ALDH3B2) and cytochrome P450 2A13. We present
   evidence that alterations in DNA methylation may be associated with AD,
   which is consistent with epigenetic theory.

TI LMP gene promoter hypermethylation is a mechanism for its down
   regulation in Kazak's esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Abnormal hypermethylation of CpG islands not only associated with tumor
   suppressor genes can lead to repression of gene expression, but also
   contribute to escape of the tumor from immune surveillance and
   contribute significantly to tumorigenesis. In the present study, we
   studied the hypermethylation of low molecular-weight protein (LMP) gene
   and its regulation on protein expression in biopsies from resected
   tissues from Kazak's esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients
   and their neighboring normal tissues. LMP2 and LMP7 genes promoter
   region methylation sequences were maped in esophageal cancer cell line
   Eca109 by bisulfite-sequencing PCR and quantitative detection of
   methylated DNA from 30 pairs of Kazak's ESCC and adjacent normal tissues
   by MassARRAY (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) and LMP2 and LMP7 protein
   expression were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. In Eca109, we
   identified 6 CG sites methylated from all of 22 CpG sites of LMP7 gene.
   However, no methylation was found for LMP2. The analysis of the data
   resulted from the quantitative analysis of single CpG site methylation
   by Sequenom MassARRAY platform, has shown that the methylation level
   between two groups CpG sites (CpG_5, CpG_9, CpG_20, CpG_21 and CpG_20)
   from CpG_1, CpG_2, CpG_3, CpG_4, CpG_5, CpG_6, CpG_7, CpG_8, CpG_9,
   CpG_10.11, CpG_12.13.14, CpG_15.16.17.18, CpG_19, CpG_20, CpG_21 and
   CpG_22 significant differences between ESCC and neighboring normal
   tissues. The analysis of methylation level of whole target CpG fragment
   indicated that the methylation level of LMP7 was significant higher in
   ESCC (0.0517 +/- A 0.0357) than in neighboring normal tissues (0.0380
   +/- A 0.0214, P < 0.05). there was a tendency of decreasing the LMP7
   proteins expression as the increasing the methylation level of LMP7 gene
   promoter regions (F = 7.69, P = 0.041). The LMP7 gene promoter
   methylation and protein downregulation were correlated at high extent in
   Kazakh's ESCC patients, and may explain the epigenetic regulation on
   gene expression.

TI Frequent epigenetic silencing of PCDH10 by methylation in human
   colorectal cancer
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Aberrant DNA methylation is common in cancer cells. Epigenetic
   alterations resulting in the loss of tumor suppression gene functions
   are frequently involved in tumor development and progression. Recently,
   methylation of PCDH10 was reported to be associated with multiple
   hematologic malignancies as well as some solid tumors. Whether the
   down-regulation of PCDH10 happens in CRC remains unknown.
   Methylation status of PCDH10 was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR
   analysis. The effects of PCDH10 re-expression were determined in growth,
   colony formation, cell cycle, and invasion assays.
   In this study, we found that 100 % (8 of 8) of colorectal cancer cell
   lines were silenced for PCDH10, but not normal colorectal epithelial
   cells. Demethylation treatment confirmed that the reduced expression is
   associated closely with promoter methylation. Hyper-methylation of
   PCDH10 was also detected in 85 % of primary colorectal tumors, but not
   in adjacent normal colorectal tissues.
   Our results suggest that PCDH10 is an important tumor suppression gene
   with key roles of suppressing cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and
   inhibiting cell invasion in the development of colorectal cancer. Thus,
   PCDH10 methylation may constitute a useful biomarker of colorectal
   cancer patients.

TI DNA methylation of the filaggrin gene adds to the risk of eczema
   associated with loss-of-function variants
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
AB Background Loss-of-function variants within the filaggrin gene (FLG) are
   associated with a dysfunctional skin barrier that contributes to the
   development of eczema. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA
   methylation, are genetic regulatory mechanisms that modulate gene
   expression without changing the DNA sequence. Objectives To investigate
   whether genetic variants and adjacent differential DNA methylation
   within the FLG gene synergistically act on the development of eczema.
   Methods A subsample (n=245, only females aged 18years) of the Isle of
   Wight birth cohort participants (n=1456) had available information for
   FLG variants R501X, 2282del4 and S3247X and DNA methylation levels for
   10 CpG sites within the FLG gene. Log-binomial regression was used to
   estimate the risk ratios (RRs) of eczema associated with FLG variants at
   different methylation levels. Results The period prevalence of eczema
   was 15.2% at age 18years and 9.0% of participants were carriers
   (heterozygous) of FLG variants. Of the 10 CpG sites spanning the genomic
   region of FLG, methylation levels of CpG site cg07548383' showed a
   significant interaction with FLG sequence variants on the risk for
   eczema. At 86% methylation level, filaggrin haploinsufficient
   individuals had a 5.48-fold increased risk of eczema when compared to
   those with wild type FLG genotype (P-value=0.0008). Conclusions Our
   novel results indicated that the association between FLG
   loss-of-function variants and eczema is modulated by DNA methylation.
   Simultaneously assessing the joint effect of genetic and epigenetic
   factors within the FLG gene further highlights the importance of this
   genomic region for eczema manifestation.

TI Social Isolation during Peri-Adolescence or Adulthood: Effects on Sexual
   Motivation, Testosterone and Corticosterone Response under Conditions of
   Sexual Arousal in Male Rats
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY
AB Reproductive functions in adult organism are known to be affected by
   different factors. Effects of social environment at the postnatal
   ontogenesis attract particular attention since it has deep impact on the
   development of physiological and emotional state of an individual.
   Effects of chronic social isolation at different ages on male sexual
   motivation, testosterone and corticosterone response under conditions of
   sexual arousal were studied in Wistar rats. After weaning at 21 day of
   age, rats of one group were isolated for six weeks and after that they
   were housed in groups of five per cage for ten weeks (Iso3-9). Rats of
   the second group were housed in groups of five animals per cage till 13
   weeks of age, and then they were isolated for six weeks (Iso13-19). Rats
   of the control group were housed in groups during the experiment. Adult
   19 week-old male rats were tested under conditions of sexual arousal.
   The expression of sexual motivation was estimated as the behavioral
   activity of a male at the transparent perforated partition separating a
   receptive female. Isolation of adult male rats reduced the number of
   approaches to the partition, while the period of time a male spent at
   the partition was not changed and testosterone response was enhanced as
   compared to control rats. Chronic social isolation during
   peri-adolescence reduced sexual motivation and prevented arousal-induced
   elevation of testosterone. Plasma corticosterone increases at sexual
   arousal in the two groups of isolated rats did not differ from that in
   controls. Our results are evidence that social isolation during the
   post-maturity stage (Iso13-19) did not diminish the manifestation of
   sexual motivation and hormonal response to a receptive female, while
   isolation during peri-adolescence attenuated behavioral and hormonal
   expression of sexual arousal in adult males.

TI DNA and histone methylation in gastric carcinogenesis
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Epigenetic alterations contribute significantly to the development and
   progression of gastric cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer death
   worldwide. Epigenetics refers to the number of modifications of the
   chromatin structure that affect gene expression without altering the
   primary sequence of DNA, and these changes lead to transcriptional
   activation or silencing of the gene. Over the years, the study of
   epigenetic processes has increased, and novel therapeutic approaches
   that target DNA methylation and histone modifications have emerged. A
   greater understanding of epigenetics and the therapeutic potential of
   manipulating these processes is necessary for gastric cancer treatment.
   Here, we review recent research on the effects of aberrant DNA and
   histone methylation on the onset and progression of gastric tumors and
   the development of compounds that target enzymes that regulate the
   epigenome. (C) 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI Role of hydrogen peroxide pretreatment in heat-induced alteration of DNA
   methylation in cucumber leaves
SO SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB To investigate whether exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) affects
   the heat-induced alteration of DNA methylation in H(2)O(2)-pretreated
   heat-stressed plants, cucumber seedlings were exposed to heat (42/38
   degrees C, daylnight) for 3 d after pretreatment with 1.5 mM H(2)O(2)
   for 12 h, and then DNA methylation patterns were detected through a
   method of methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP). Exogenous
   H(2)O(2) mitigated growth suppression caused by heat. Meanwhile, using
   120 pairs of primers, small percentages (16.2-16.4%) of DNA sequences
   were methylated in leaves when cucumbers were subjected to heat or
   pre-treated with H(2)O(2), and 20 MSAP loci were selected for
   differentially amplified fragments. Among which sequences of three MSAP
   fragments had identity with coding sequences of gene Csa026131,
   Csa012834 and Csa015520 in cucumbers, respectively. Compared to control,
   heat treatment caused methylation in 6 MSAP loci and led to
   demethylation in 4 loci, while the combined effect of H(2)O(2)
   pretreatment and heat aroused methylation in 8 loci and induced
   demethylation in 6 loci. In comparison to heat treatment alone, the
   combination of H(2)O(2) pretreatment and heat aroused 4 MSAP loci to be
   demethylated and caused 4 MSAP loci to be methylated, and it as well
   enhanced the transcript levels of gene Csa026131 and Csa012834 and
   decreased the expression of gene Csa015520. Results of bisulfite
   sequencing PCR showed that the cytosine methylation levels in gene
   Csa026131 and Csa015520 were different between heat and H(2)O(2) + heat
   treatments. We propose H(2)O(2) changes the heat-induced alteration of
   DNA methylation when it is used to mitigate heat stress of cucumbers.

TI Most Methylation-Susceptible DNA Sequences in Human Embryonic Stem Cells
   Undergo a Change in Conformation or Flexibility upon Methylation
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB DNA methylation in eukaryotes occurs on the cytosine bases in CG, CHG,
   and CHH (where H indicates non-G nucleotides) contexts and provides an
   important epigenetic mark in various biological processes. However, the
   structural and physical properties of methylated DNA are poorly
   understood. Using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we
   performed a systematic study of the influence of DNA methylation on the
   conformation and physical properties of DNA for all CG, CHG, and CHH
   contexts. In the CG context, methylated multimers of the
   CG/CG-containing unit fragment migrated in gels slightly faster than
   their unmethylated counterparts. In the CHG context, both homo- and
   hemimethylation caused retarded migration of multimers of the
   CAG/CTG-containing fragment. In the CHH context, methylation caused or
   enhanced retarded migration of the multimers of CAA/TTG-, CAT/ATG-,
   CAC/GTG-, CTA/TAG-, or CTT/AAG-containing fragments. These results
   suggest that methylation increases DNA rigidity in the CG context and
   introduces distortions into several CHG and CHH sequences. More
   interestingly, we found that nearly all of the methylation repertoires
   in the CHG context and 98% of those in the CHH context in human
   embryonic stem cells were species that undergo conformational changes
   upon methylation. Similarly, most of the methylation repertoires in the
   Arabidopsis CHG and CHH contexts were sequences with methylation-induced
   distortion. We hypothesize that the methylation-induced properties or
   conformational changes in DNA may facilitate nucleosome formation, which
   provides the essential mechanism for alterations of chromatin density.

TI Beneficial effects of natural phenolics on levodopa methylation and
   oxidative neurodegeneration
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Levodopa (L-DOPA) is widely used for symptomatic management in
   Parkinson's disease. We recently showed that
   (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a tea polyphenol, not only inhibits
   L-DOPA methylation, but also protects against oxidative hippocampal
   neurodegeneration. In the present study, we sought to determine several
   other common dietary phenolics, namely, tea catechins [(+)-catechin and
   (-)-epicatechin] and a representative flavonoid (quercetin), for their
   ability to modulate L-DOPA methylation and to protect against oxidative
   hippocampal injury. A combination of in vitro biochemical assays, cell
   culture-based mechanistic analyses, and in vivo animal models was used.
   While both tea catechins and quercetin strongly inhibit human liver
   catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)mediated O-methylation of L-DOPA in
   vitro, only (+)-catechin exerts a significant inhibition of L-DOPA
   methylation in both peripheral compartment and striatum in rats. The
   stronger in vivo effect of (+)-catechin on L-DOPA methylation compared
   to the other dietary compounds is due to its better bioavailability in
   vivo. In addition, (+)-catechin strongly reduces glutamate-induced
   oxidative cytotoxicity in HT22 mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro
   through inactivation of the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway.
   Administration of (+)-catechin also exerts a strong neuroprotective
   effect in the kainic acid-induced oxidative hippocampal
   neurodegeneration model in rats. In conclusion, (+)-catechin is a
   dietary polyphenolic that may have beneficial effects in L-DOPA-based
   treatment of Parkinson patients by inhibiting L-DOPA methylation plus
   reducing oxidative neurodegeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Histone modifications in the male germ line of Drosophila(a)
SO BMC DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Background: In the male germ line of Drosophila chromatin remains
   decondensed and highly transcribed during meiotic prophase until it is
   rapidly compacted. A large proportion of the cell cycle-regulated
   histone H3.1 is replaced by H3.3, a histone variant encoded outside the
   histone repeat cluster and not subject to cell cycle controlled
   expression.
   Results: We investigated histone modification patterns in testes of D.
   melanogaster and D. hydei. In somatic cells of the testis envelope and
   in germ cells these modification patterns differ from those typically
   seen in eu- and heterochromatin of other somatic cells. During the
   meiotic prophase some modifications expected in active chromatin are not
   found or are found at low level. The absence of H4K16ac suggests that
   dosage compensation does not take place. Certain histone modifications
   correspond to either the cell cycle-regulated histone H3.1 or to the
   testis-specific variant H3.3. In spermatogonia we found H3K9 methylation
   in cytoplasmic histones, most likely corresponding to the H3.3 histone
   variant. Most histone modifications persist throughout the meiotic
   divisions. The majority of modifications persist until the early
   spermatid nuclei, and only a minority further persist until the final
   chromatin compaction stages before individualization of the spermatozoa.
   Conclusion: Histone modification patterns in the male germ line differ
   from expected patterns. They are consistent with an absence of dosage
   compensation of the X chromosome during the male meiotic prophase. The
   cell cycle-regulated histone variant H3.1 and H3.3, expressed throughout
   the cell cycle, also vary in their modification patterns.
   Postmeiotically, we observed a highly complex pattern of the histone
   modifications until late spermatid nuclear elongation stages. This may
   be in part due to postmeiotic transcription and in part to differential
   histone replacement during chromatin condensation.

TI A Core Chromatin Remodeling Factor Instructs Global Chromatin Signaling

SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB ATP-dependent NuRD repressor complexes involve combinatorial assembly of
   its subunits. However, the mechanism of gene transcription by MTA1/NuRD
   remains enigmatic. Here we report that MTA1 methylation by G9a
   methytransferase and demethylation by LSD1 determines the nucleosome
   remodeling and transcriptional outcome. Contrary to the current static
   repressor model of the NuRD complex, we discovered that MTA1 association
   with nucleosomes and corepressor/coactivator complexes is dynamic. While
   methylated MTA1 is required for the NuRD repressor complex, demethylated
   MTA1 recognizes the bivalent histone H3K4-AcK9 mark and recruits
   coactivator NURF-trithorax remodeling complex in a signaling-dependent
   manner. MTA1's lysine 532 methylation represents a molecular switch as
   methylated and demethylated MTA1 nucleate NuRD or NURF complexes with
   opposite functions in a cyclical manner. In addition, MTA1 possesses an
   inherent histone amplifier activity with an instructive role in
   impacting the epigenetic landscape, providing a new perspective to the
   molecular governance of dual coregulator functions of a master
   coregulator.

TI Tet Proteins Connect the O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine Transferase Ogt to
   Chromatin in Embryonic Stem Cells
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GIcNAc) transferase (Ogt) activity is
   essential for embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability and mouse development.
   Ogt is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of different cell
   types and catalyzes serine and threonine glycosylation. We have
   characterized the biochemical features of nuclear Ogt and identified the
   ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins Tet1 and Tet2 as stable partners
   of Ogt in the nucleus of ESCs. We show at a genome-wide level that Ogt
   preferentially associates with Teti to genes promoters in close
   proximity of CpG-rich transcription start sites. These regions are
   characterized by low levels of DNA modification, suggesting a link
   between Teti and Ogt activities in regulating CpG island nnethylation.
   Finally, we show that Teti is required for binding of Ogt to chromatin
   affecting Teti activity. Taken together, our data characterize how
   O-GIcNAcylation is recruited to chromatin and interacts with the
   activity of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases.

TI Histone-Methyltransferase MLL2 (KMT2B) Is Required for Memory Formation
   in Mice
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB The consolidation of long-term memories requires differential gene
   expression. Recent research has suggested that dynamic changes in
   chromatin structure play a role in regulating the gene expression
   program linked to memory formation. The contribution of histone
   methylation, an important regulatory mechanism of chromatin plasticity
   that is mediated by the counteracting activity of
   histone-methyltransferases and histone-demethylases, is, however, not
   well understood. Here we show that mice lacking the
   histone-methyltransferase myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 2
   (mll2/kmt2b) gene in adult forebrain excitatory neurons display impaired
   hippocampus-dependent memory function. Consistent with the role of KMT2B
   in gene-activation DNA microarray analysis revealed that 152 genes were
   downregulated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region of mice lacking
   kmt2b. Downregulated plasticity genes showed a specific deficit in
   histone 3 lysine 4 di-and trimethylation, while histone 3 lysine 4
   monomethylation was not affected. Our data demonstrates that KMT2B
   mediates hippocampal histone 3 lysine 4 di-and trimethylation and is a
   critical player for memory formation.

TI Label-Free Real-Time Detection of DNA Methylation Based on Quartz
   Crystal Microbalance Measurement
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene
   transcription, chromatin compaction, genome imprinting, and X-chromosome
   inactivation. DNA methyltransferase is considered a potential target for
   anticancer drug design. It is important to locate aberrantly methylated
   sequences on the human genome that are linked to specific diseases and
   to discover new low-toxic methylation inhibitors for medical treatments.
   We developed a DNA methylation detection method using a quartz crystal
   microbalance (QCM). We applied this method to assay genes p16 and GALR2
   in two cell lines. Methylation of p16 was detected in both HT29 and
   HepG2 cell lines, whereas methylation of GALR2 was detected only in the
   HT29 cell line. We also used this method to evaluate the effect of
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine), a methyltransferase inhibitor used
   in clinical treatment. We found methylation of genes p16 and GALR2 to be
   strongly inhibited. The results show that this method is sensitive to
   DNA methylation and is fit for evaluation of methyltransferase
   inhibitors.

TI Unusual chromatin status and organization of the inactive X chromosome
   in murine trophoblast giant cells
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) enables dosage compensation
   between XX females and XY males. It is an essential process and its
   absence in XX individuals results in early lethality due primarily to
   extra-embryonic defects. This sensitivity to X-linked gene dosage in
   extra-embryonic tissues is difficult to reconcile with the reported
   tendency of escape from XCI in these tissues. The precise
   transcriptional status of the inactive X chromosome in different
   lineages has mainly been examined using transgenes or in in vitro
   differentiated stem cells and the degree to which endogenous X-linked
   genes are silenced in embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages during
   early postimplantation stages is unclear. Here we investigate the
   precise temporal and lineage-specific X-inactivation status of several
   genes in postimplantation mouse embryos. We find stable gene silencing
   in most lineages, with significant levels of escape from XCI mainly in
   one extra-embryonic cell type: trophoblast giant cells (TGCs). To
   investigate the basis of this epigenetic instability, we examined the
   chromatin structure and organization of the inactive X chromosome in
   TGCs obtained from ectoplacental cone explants. We find that the Xist
   RNA-coated X chromosome has a highly unusual chromatin content in TGCs,
   presenting both heterochromatic marks such as H3K27me3 and euchromatic
   marks such as histone H4 acetylation and H3K4 methylation. Strikingly,
   Xist RNA does not form an overt silent nuclear compartment or Cot1 hole
   in these cells. This unusual combination of silent and active features
   is likely to reflect, and might underlie, the partial activity of the X
   chromosome in TGCs.

TI Fluoxetine alters adult freshwater mussel behavior and larval
   metamorphosis
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB We used acute and partial-lifecycle tests to examine the effects of the
   pharmaceutical fluoxetine on freshwater mussels (Unionida). In acute
   tests lasting 24-48 h, we determined median effective concentrations
   (EC50s) for fluoxetine with larval (glochidia viability) and juvenile
   (survival) life-stages of fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea) and black
   sandshell (Ligumia recta). In a 28-d behavioral test we exposed brooding
   adult female wavy-rayed lampmussels (Lampsilis fasciola) to 037 and 293
   mu g/L fluoxetine to determine effects on adult behavior (foot
   protrusion, mantle lure display and glochidia parturition). We also
   assessed the effects of 24-h exposure of 1 and 100 mu g/L fluoxetine on
   glochidia viability duration and metamorphosis success for the
   wavy-rayed lampmussel. Fluoxetine EC50s ranged from 62 mu g/L for
   juveniles (96 h) to 293 mu g/L for glochidia (24 h). In adults,
   statistically significant increases were observed in foot protrusion at
   037 and 29.3 mu g/L fluoxetine and lure display rates at 293 mu g/L;
   glothiclia parturition was not significantly affected at any test
   concentration. Twenty-four hour exposure of glochidia to fluoxetine did
   not affect viability duration, but likelihood of metamorphosis to the
   juvenile stage significantly increased with 1 and 100 mu g/L treatments.
   Our results demonstrated effects of fluoxetine to unionid mussels at
   concentrations less than previously reported and approaching
   concentrations measured in surface waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

TI The Methyltransferase NSD3 Has Chromatin-binding Motifs, PHD5-C5HCH,
   That Are Distinct from Other NSD (Nuclear Receptor SET Domain) Family
   Members in Their Histone H3 Recognition
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The NSD (nuclear receptor SET domain-containing) family members,
   consisting of NSD1, NSD2 (MMSET/WHSC1), and NSD3 (WHSC1L1), are SET
   domain-containing methyltransferases and aberrant expression of each
   member has been implicated in multiple diseases. They have specific
   mono-and dimethylase activities for H3K36, whereas play nonredundant
   roles during development. Aside from the well characterized catalytic
   SET domain, NSD proteins have multiple potential chromatin-binding
   motifs that are clinically relevant, including the fifth plant
   homeodomain (PHD5) and the adjacent Cys-His-rich domain (C5HCH) located
   at the C terminus. Herein, we report the crystal structures of the
   PHD5-C5HCH module of NSD3, in the free state and in complex with H3(1-7)
   (H3 residues 1-7), H3(1-15) (H3 residues 1-15), and H3(1-15)K9me3 (H3
   residues 1-15 with trimethylation on K9) peptides. These structures
   reveal that the PHD5 and C5HCH domains fold into a novel integrated
   PHD-PHD-like structural module with H3 peptide bound only on the surface
   of PHD5 and provide the molecular basis for the recognition of
   unmodified H3K4 and trimethylated H3K9 by NSD3 PHD5. Structural studies
   and binding assays show that differences exist in histone binding
   specificity of the PHD5 domain between three members of the NSD family.
   For NSD2, the PHD5-C5HCH: H3 N terminus interaction is largely
   conserved, although with a stronger preference for unmethylated H3K9
   (H3K9me0) than trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3), and NSD1 PHD5-C5HCH does
   not bind to H3 peptides. Our results shed light on how NSD proteins that
   mediate H3K36 methylation are localized to specific genomic sites and
   provide implications for the mechanism of functional diversity of NSD
   proteins.

TI Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of
   a repressive chromatin state
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB In the metazoan germline, piwi proteins and associated piwi-interacting
   RNAs (piRNAs) provide a defense system against the expression of
   transposable elements. In the cytoplasm, piRNA sequences guide piwi
   complexes to destroy complementary transposon transcripts by
   endonucleolytic cleavage. However, some piwi family members are nuclear,
   raising the possibility of alternative pathways for piRNA-mediated
   regulation of gene expression. We found that Drosophila Piwi is
   recruited to chromatin, colocalizing with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on
   polytene chromosomes. Knockdown of Piwi in the germline increases
   expression of transposable elements that are targeted by piRNAs, whereas
   protein-coding genes remain largely unaffected. Derepression of
   transposons upon Piwi depletion correlates with increased occupancy of
   Pol II on their promoters. Expression of piRNAs that target a reporter
   construct results in a decrease in Pol II occupancy and an increase in
   repressive H3K9me3 marks and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) on the
   reporter locus. Our results indicate that Piwi identifies targets
   complementary to the associated piRNA and induces transcriptional
   repression by establishing a repressive chromatin state when correct
   targets are found.

TI A chronic combinatory stress model that activates the HPA axis and
   avoids habituation in BALB/C mice
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB A detailed protocol is described to induce chronic stress in BALB/c
   mice, which affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The
   protocol is based on a combination of two mild physical stressors:
   restraint stress and forced swimming. Physical stressors were applied on
   an alternative schedule: one day restraint, next day swimming, during a
   28-day period. Mice were sacrificed at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 and plasma
   was obtained. Optimized chromatographic system with electrochemical
   detection and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit were used
   to measure catecholamines [representative of the activation of the
   autonomic nervous system (ANS)] and corticosterone (representative of
   the activation of the HPA axis). Corticosterone levels increased in mice
   under stress and remained significantly higher in stressed mice compared
   to control animals throughout the experimental procedure, indicating
   that mice did not show habituation to the combined stress. In our
   experimental conditions, catecholamine levels were not useful as an
   index of stress. The stress model applied here provoked a steady
   activation of the HPA axis resulting in the constant secretion of
   corticosterone from the adrenal gland, which may prevent the activation
   of the ANS axis. The simple and economic stress model presented here
   affected the HPA axis but not the ANS of BALB/c mice and is useful for
   the study of metabolic stress-related gastric pathology and stress
   hormone secretion in mice. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Trithorax Group Protein Ash2l Is Essential for Pluripotency and
   Maintaining Open Chromatin in Embryonic Stem Cells
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Embryonic stem (ES) cells exhibit general characteristics of open
   chromatin, a state that may be necessary for ES cells to efficiently
   self-renew while remaining poised for differentiation. Histone H3K4 and
   H3K9 trimethylation associate as a general rule, with open and silenced
   chromatin, respectively, for ES cell pluripotency maintenance. However,
   how histone modifications are regulated to maintain open chromatin in ES
   cells remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that trithorax
   protein Ash2l, homologue of the Drosophila Ash2 (absent, small,
   homeotic-2) protein, is a key regulator of open chromatin in ES cells.
   Consistent with Ash2l being a core subunit of mixed lineage leukemia
   methyltransferase complex, RNAiknockdownofAsh2lwassufficienttoreduceH3K4
   methylation levels and drive ES cells to a silenced chromatin state with
   high H3K9 trimethylation. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis indicated that
   Ash2l is recruited to target loci through two distinct modes and
   enriched at a family of genes implicated in open chromatin regulation,
   including chromatin remodeler Cdh7, transcription factor c-Myc, and H3K9
   demethylase Kdm4c. Our results underscore the importance of Ash2l in
   open chromatin regulation and provide insight into how the open
   chromatin landscape is maintained in ES cells.

TI BroadPeak: a novel algorithm for identifying broad peaks in diffuse
   ChIP-seq datasets
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Although some histone modification chromatin immunoprecipitation
   followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) signals show abrupt
   peaks across narrow and specific genomic locations, others have diffuse
   distributions along chromosomes, and their large contiguous enrichment
   landscapes are better modeled as broad peaks. Here, we present
   BroadPeak, an algorithm for the identification of such broad peaks from
   diffuse ChIP-seq datasets. We show that BroadPeak is a linear time
   algorithm that requires only two parameters, and we validate its
   performance on real and simulated histone modification ChIP-seq
   datasets. BroadPeak calls peaks that are highly coincident with both the
   underlying ChIP-seq tag count distributions and relevant biological
   features, such as the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, and it
   shows superior overall recall and precision of known broad peaks from
   simulated datasets.

AB Signal transduction pathways converge upon sequence-specific DNA binding

   team up with chromatin modifying activities. However, chromatin is not
   simply an endpoint for signaling pathways. Histone modifications relay
   signals to other proteins to trigger more immediate responses than can
   be achieved through altered gene transcription, which might be
   especially important to time-urgent processes such as the execution of
   cell-cycle check points, chromosome segregation, or exit from mitosis.
   In addition, histone-modifying enzymes often have multiple nonhistone
   substrates, and coordination of activity toward different targets might
   direct signals both to and from chromatin.

TI The Polycomb complex PRC2 supports aberrant self-renewal in a mouse
   model of MLL-AF9;Nras(G12D) acute myeloid leukemia
SO ONCOGENE
AB The Trithorax and Polycomb groups of chromatin regulators are critical
   for cell-lineage specification during normal development; functions that
   often become deregulated during tumorigenesis. As an example, oncogenic
   fusions of the Trithorax-related protein mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)
   can initiate aggressive leukemias by altering the transcriptional
   circuitry governing hematopoietic cell differentiation, a process that
   requires multiple epigenetic pathways to implement. Here we used shRNA
   screening to identify chromatin regulators uniquely required in a mouse
   model of MLL-fusion acute myeloid leukemia, which revealed a role for
   the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in maintenance of this disease.
   shRNA-mediated suppression of PRC2 subunits Eed, Suz12 or Ezh1/Ezh2 led
   to proliferation arrest and differentiation of leukemia cells, with a
   minimal impact on growth of several non-transformed hematopoietic cell
   lines. The requirement for PRC2 in leukemia is partly because of its
   role in direct transcriptional repression of genes that limit the
   self-renewal potential of hennatopoietic cells, including Cdkn2a. In
   addition to implicating a role for PRC2 in the pathogenesis of
   MLL-fusion leukemia, our results suggest, more generally, that Trithorax
   and Polycomb group proteins can cooperate with one another to maintain
   aberrant lineage programs in cancer. Oncogene (2013) 32, 930-938;

TI Epigenetic inactivation of the MIR129-2 in hematological malignancies
SO JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
AB Background: MIR129-2 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor microRNA
   hypermethylated in epithelial cancers.
   Patients and methods: Epigenetic inactivation of MIR129-2 was studied by
   methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in 13 cell lines (eight myeloma and five
   lymphoma), 15 normal controls and 344 primary samples including acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic
   myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
   non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM) at diagnosis, MM at
   relapse/progression, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
   significance (MGUS). Expression of MIR129 and its target, SOX4, in cell
   lines was measured before and after hypomethylating treatment and MIR129
   overexpression. MIR129 expression was correlated with MIR129-2
   methylation status in primary lymphoma samples. Tumor suppressor
   function of MIR129 was demonstrated by MTT and trypan blue exclusion
   assay after MIR129 overexpression.
   Results: The sensitivity of the methylated-MSP was one in 10(3).
   Different MSP statuses, including complete methylation, partial
   methylation, and complete unmethylation, were verified by quantitative
   bisulfite pyrosequencing. All five lymphoma and seven of eight myeloma
   cell lines showed complete and partial MIR129-2 methylation. In primary
   samples, MIR129-2 methylation was absent in AML and CML, but detected in
   5% ALL, 45.9% CLL, 49.5% MM at diagnosis, and 59.1% NHL. In CLL,
   MIR129-2 methylation adversely impacted on survival (p=0.004). In MM,
   MIR129-2 methylation increased from 27.5% MGUS to 49.5% MM at diagnosis
   and 41.5% at relapse/progression (p=0.023). In NHL, MIR129-2 methylation
   was associated with MIR124-1 and MIR203 methylation (p<0.001), and lower
   MIR129 expression (p=0.009). Hypomethylation treatment of JEKO-1,
   homozygously methylated for MIR129-2, led to MIR129-2 demethylation and
   MIR129 re-expression, with downregulation of SOX4 mRNA. Moreover, MIR129
   overexpression in both mantle cell lines, JEKO-1 and GRANTA-519,
   inhibited cellular proliferation and enhanced cell death, with
   concomitant SOX4 mRNA downregulation.
   Conclusions: MIR129-2 is a tumor suppressive microRNA frequently
   methylated in lymphoid but not myeloid malignancies, leading to
   reversible MIR129-2 silencing. In CLL, MIR129-2 methylation was
   associated with an inferior survival. In MM, MIR129-2 methylation might
   be acquired during progression from MGUS to symptomatic MM. In NHL,
   MIR129-2 methylation might collaborate with MIR124-1 and MIR203
   methylation in lymphomagenesis.

TI ALTERED GABAERGIC AND GLUTAMATERGIC ACTIVITY WITHIN THE RAT HIPPOCAMPUS
   AND AMYGDALA IN RATS SUBJECTED TO REPEATED CORTICOSTERONE ADMINISTRATION
   BUT NOT RESTRAINT STRESS
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB We investigated the effect of two well characterized preclinical animal
   models of depression - repeated injections of corticosterone (CORT) and
   repeated restraint stress - on markers of GABAergic and glutamatergic
   activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. Stress is an identified risk
   factor for the onset of major depression, but the neurobiological
   mechanisms by which stress may produce depressogenic effects are not
   clear. Rats received one of the following four treatments for 21
   consecutive days: daily single CORT injections (40 mg/kg), daily single
   vehicle injections, daily 6 h of restraint stress, or daily handling.
   After the 21-day stress period, all rats were sacrificed and hippocampal
   and amygdalar tissue was collected and prepared for Western blot
   analyses. We examined the effect of CORT and restraint stress on
   glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-65 and GAD67, as well as the alpha 1,
   alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta 2-3 GABA(A) receptor subunits, and the
   vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)-2. We found that CORT
   significantly decreased GAD65 and the alpha 2 receptor subunit and
   increased VGLUT2 within the hippocampus. We also found that CORT
   decreased GAD67 and the alpha 2 receptor subunit in the amygdala.
   However, restraint stress had no significant effect on protein
   expression in either the hippocampus or the amygdala. These findings
   parallel our previous results showing that repeated CORT injections, but
   not restraint stress, increase depression-like behavior in rats, and
   suggest that the depressogenic effects of CORT may be related to
   alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in
   stress-sensitive regions of the brain. (c) 2012 IBRO. Published by

TI Targeted Methylation and Gene Silencing of VEGF-A in Human Cells by
   Using a Designed Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L Single-Chain Fusion Protein with
   Increased DNA Methylation Activity
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The C-terminal domain of the Dnmt3a de novo DNA methyltransferase
   (Dnmt3a-C) forms a complex with the C-terminal domain of Dnmt3L, which
   stimulates its catalytic activity. We generated and characterized
   single-chain (sc) fusion proteins of both these domains with linker
   lengths between 16 and 30 amino acid residues. The purified sc proteins
   showed about 10-fold higher DNA methylation activities than Dnmt3a-C in
   vitro and were more active in bacterial cells as well. After fusing the
   Dnmt3a-3L sc enzyme to an artificial zinc-finger protein targeting the
   vascular endothelial cell growth factor A (VEGF-A) promoter, we
   demonstrate successful targeting of DNA methylation to the VEGF-A
   promoter in human cells and observed that almost complete methylation of
   12 CpG sites in the gene promoter could be achieved. Targeted
   methylation by the Dnmt3a-3L sc enzymes was about twofold higher than
   that of Dnmt3a-C, indicating that Dnmt3a-3L sc variants are more
   efficient as catalytic modules in chimeric DNA methyltransfeases than
   Dnmt3a-C. Targeted methylation of the VEGF-A promoter with the Dnmt3a-3L
   sc variant led to a strong silencing of VEGF-A expression, indicating
   that the artificial DNA methylation of an endogenous promoter is a
   powerful strategy to achieve silencing of the corresponding gene in
   human cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An H3K36 Methylation-Engaging Tudor Motif of Polycomb-like Proteins
   Mediates PRC2 Complex Targeting
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates pluripotency,
   differentiation, and tumorigenesis through catalysis of histone H3
   lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on chromatin. However, the
   mechanisms that underlie PRC2 recruitment and spreading on chromatin
   remain unclear. Here we report that histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation
   (H3K36me3) binding activity is harbored in the Tudor motifs of
   PRC2-associated polycomb-like (PCL) proteins PHF1/PCL1 and PHF19/PCL3.
   Ectopically expressed PHF1 induced Tudor-dependent stabilization of PRC2
   complexes on bulk chromatin and mediated spreading of PRC2 and H3K27me3
   into H3K36me3-containing chromatin regions. In murine pluripotent stem
   cells, we identified coexistence of H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and PHF19/PCL3
   at a subset of poised developmental genes and demonstrated that
   PHF19/PCL3 Tudor function. is required for optimal H3K27me3 and
   repression of these loci. Collectively, our data suggest that PCL
   recognition of H3K36me3 promotes intrusion of PRC2 complexes into active
   chromatin regions to promote gene silencing and modulate the chromatin
   landscape during development.

TI Replication-coupled passive DNA demethylation for the erasure of genome
   imprints in mice
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB Genome-wide DNA demethylation, including the erasure of genome imprints,
   in primordial germ cells (PGCs) is a critical first step to creating a
   totipotent epigenome in the germ line. We show here that, contrary to
   the prevailing model emphasizing active DNA demethylation, imprint
   erasure in mouse PGCs occurs in a manner largely consistent with
   replication-coupled passive DNA demethylation: PGCs erase imprints
   during their rapid cycling with little de novo or maintenance DNA
   methylation potential and no apparent major chromatin alterations. Our
   findings necessitate the re-evaluation of and provide novel insights
   into the mechanism of genome-wide DNA demethylation in PGCs.

TI The epigenetic landscape of oral squamous cell carcinoma
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Background: There is relatively little methylation array data available
   specifically for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to
   compare the DNA methylome across a large cohort of tumour/normal pairs.
   Methods: DNA was extracted from 44 OSCCs and paired normal mucosa. DNA
   methylation analysis employed the Illumina GoldenGate high-throughput
   array comprising 1505 CpG loci selected from 807 epigenetically
   regulated genes. This data was correlated with extracapsular spread
   (ECS), human papilloma virus (HPV) status, recurrence and 5-year
   survival.
   Results: Differential methylation levels of a number of genes
   distinguished the tumour tissue sample from the matched normal. Putative
   methylation signatures for ECS and recurrence were identified. The
   concept of concordant methylation or CpG island methylator phenotype
   (CIMP) in OSCC is supported by our data, with an association between
   'CIMP-high' and worse prognosis. Epigenetic deregulation of NOTCH4
   signalling in OSCC was also observed, as part of a possible methylation
   signature for recurrence, with parallels to recently discovered NOTCH
   mutations in HNSCC. Differences in methylation in HPV-driven cases were
   seen, but are less significant than that has been recently proposed in
   other series.
   Conclusion: Although OSCC seems as much an 'epigenetic' as a genetic
   disease, the translational potential of cancer epigenetics has yet to be
   fully exploited. This data points to the application of epigenetic
   biomarkers and targets available to further the development of therapy
   in OSCC.

TI Extensive changes in DNA methylation are associated with expression of
   mutant huntingtin
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The earliest stages of Huntington disease are marked by changes in gene
   expression that are caused in an indirect and poorly understood manner
   by polyglutamine expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. To explore
   the hypothesis that DNA methylation may be altered in cells expressing
   mutated HTT, we use reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)
   to map sites of DNA methylation in cells carrying either wild-type or
   mutant HTT. We find that a large fraction of the genes that change in
   expression in the presence of mutant huntingtin demonstrate significant
   changes in DNA methylation. Regions with low CpG content, which have
   previously been shown to undergo methylation changes in response to
   neuronal activity, are disproportionately affected. On the basis of the
   sequence of regions that change in methylation, we identify AP-1 and
   SOX2 as transcriptional regulators associated with DNA methylation
   changes, and we confirm these hypotheses using genome-wide chromatin
   immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Our findings suggest new
   mechanisms for the effects of polyglutamine-expanded HTT. These results
   also raise important questions about the potential effects of changes in
   DNA methylation on neurogenesis and cognitive decline in patients with
   Huntington disease.

TI Comprehending dynamic protein methylation with mass spectrometry
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB Protein methylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) which
   modulates cellular and biological processes including transcription, RNA
   processing, protein interactions and protein dynamics. Methylation,
   catalyzed by highly specific methyltransferase enzymes, occurs on
   several amino acids including arginine, lysine, histidine and
   dicarboxylic amino acids like glutamate. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based
   techniques continue to be the methods of choice for the study of protein
   PTMs. These approaches are powerful and sensitive tools that have been
   used to identify, quantify and characterize protein methylation. In
   addition, metabolic labeling strategies can be coupled to MS detection
   in order to measure dynamic and differential in vivo protein methylation
   rates. In this review, different applications of mass spectrometry
   technologies and methods to study protein methylation are discussed.

TI Metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor antagonists improve behavioral and
   prefrontal dopaminergic alterations in the chronic
   corticosterone-induced depression model in mice
SO NEUROPHARMACOLOGY
AB Metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptor antagonists have an
   antidepressant-like effect, but the exact mechanism still remains
   unclear. This study examined the effects of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists
   in chronic corticosterone-treated mice which could be used as an animal
   model of depression. In the forced swim test, the rnGlu2/3 receptor
   antagonists MGS0039 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and LY341495 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p)
   significantly reduced the increased immobility time of mice pretreated
   with corticosterone (20 mg/kg, s.c.) for 21 days, while desipramine (30
   mg/kg, i.p.) and fluoxetine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) did not. The
   antidepressant-like effect of LY341495 was not blocked by the
   alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor
   antagonist NBQX (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Systemic administration of LY341495
   did not affect basal release of glutamate, dopamine or serotonin in the
   prefrontal cortex of the control or chronic corticosterone-treated mice.
   Chronic corticosterone markedly enhanced high K(+)-induced release of
   dopamine, but not serotonin or glutamate, in the prefrontal cortex. This
   neurochemical change was blocked by systemic administration of MGS0039
   and LY341495, but not desipramine or fluoxetine. These results suggest
   that chronic corticosterone-treated mice could be used as an animal
   model of treatment-resistant depression. This study also suggests that
   the prefrontal dopaminergic system is involved in the
   antidepressant-like effect of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists in the
   chronic corticosterone-induced depression model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Long-Lasting Increase of Corticosterone After Fear Memory Reactivation:
   Anxiolytic Effects and Network Activity Modulation in the Ventral
   Hippocampus
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Pathological fear and anxiety can be studied, in rodents, with fear
   conditioning and exposure to reminder cues. These paradigms are thought
   to critically involve the ventral hippocampus, which also serves as key
   site of glucocorticoid action in the brain. Here, we demonstrate a
   long-lasting reduction of kainate-induced gamma oscillations in slice
   preparations of the ventral hippocampal area CA3, 30 days after a single
   fear conditioning training. Reduction of gamma power was sensitive to
   corticosterone application and associated with a decrease in
   glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression across
   strata of the ventral hippocampal CA3. A fear reactivation session 24 h
   after the initial conditioning normalized receptor expression levels and
   attenuated the corticosterone-mediated recovery of gamma oscillations.
   It moreover increased both baseline and stimulus-induced corticosterone
   plasma levels and evoked a generalization of fear memory to the
   background context. Reduced ventral hippocampal gamma oscillation in
   both fear reactivated and non-reactivated mice were associated with a
   decrease of anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze. Taking
   advantage of the circadian fluctuation in corticosterone, we
   demonstrated the association of high endogenous basal corticosterone
   plasma concentrations during morning hours with reduced anxiety-like
   behavior in fear reactivated mice. The anxiolytic effect of the hormone
   was verified with local applications to the ventral hippocampus. Our
   data suggest that corticosterone acting on ventral hippocampal network
   activity has anxiolytic-like effects following fear exposure,
   highlighting its potential therapeutic value for anxiety disorders.

TI Association between blood pressure and DNA methylation of
   retrotransposons and pro-inflammatory genes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background Methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an epigenetic
   regulator of gene expression that changes with age, but its contribution
   to aging-related disorders, including high blood pressure (BP), is still
   largely unknown. We examined the relation of BP to the methylation of
   retrotransposon sequences of DNA and of selected candidate genes.
   Methods This investigation included 789 elderly participants in the
   Normative Aging Study, ranging in age from 55 to 100 years, who had
   longitudinal measurements of DNA methylation. In these subjects' DNA we
   measured the proportion of methylated sites in retrotransposable
   sequences and in pro-inflammatory genes, expressed as the percent of
   5-methylated cytosines (%5mC) among all cytosines. From one to four
   methylation measurements were made for each subject between 1999 and
   2009. We fit mixed-effects models, using repeated measures of BP as the
   outcome and DNA methylation as the explanatory variable, adjusting for
   confounding variables. We also fit a Bayesian mixed-effects structural
   equation model to account for heterogeneity in the effects of
   methylation sites within each gene.
   Results An increase in inter-quartile range (IQR) in the methylation of
   Alu elements was associated with an increase of 0.97 mm Hg in diastolic
   blood pressure (DBP) (95% CI 0.32-1.57), but no such association was
   observed for long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1). We also found
   positive associations between DBP and methylation of the genes for
   toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
   and a negative association between DBP and methylation of the gene for
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Associations between methylation and
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) were weaker than those between methylation
   and DBP. Bayesian mixed-effects structural equation model results were
   similar for both DBP and SBP models.
   Conclusions The results of our study suggest that changes in DNA
   methylation of some pro-inflammatory genes and retrotransposable
   elements are related to small changes in BP.

TI Dietary protein restriction and excess of pregnant German Landrace sows
   induce changes in hepatic gene expression and promoter methylation of
   key metabolic genes in the offspring
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Maternal nutrition during gestation has important effects on offspring
   gene expression mediated by DNA methylation. In order to evaluate the
   effect of restricted and excess protein intake during gestation, hepatic
   gene expression and DNA methylation of key metabolic genes NR3C1, PPAR
   alpha, HMGCR, PGC1 alpha, INSR and CYP2C34 were investigated. Liver
   samples of German Landrace offspring were collected at Gestational Day
   95, at birth, at weaning and from finisher pigs. Gene expression in
   foetal liver revealed significant differences between the control group
   (LP) and the low-protein group (LP) in HMGCR (P<.0001), INSR (P=.0003),
   NR3C1 (P=.020) and PGC1 alpha (P=.003). At birth INSR (P=.032), PPAR
   alpha (P=.0006) and CYP2C34 (P<.0001) showed significant differences
   between LP and CO. CYP2C34 was significantly increased in the
   high-protein group (HP) compared to CO (P=.001). At weaning, INSR was
   significantly higher expressed in LP than in CO (P=.018). HMGCR showed a
   significant decrease of transcript amount in HP compared to CO
   (P=.0006). Furthermore, we studied the question whether gene expression
   differences between distinct diet groups are a result of differential
   DNA methylation status. CpG sites in the 5'-flanking region of CYP2C34
   showed a significant positive correlation with transcript amount in LP
   (nt -137: R=0.67, P<.0001; nt -112: R=0.54, P=.003). In NR3C1
   methylation, differences in the CpG island were negatively correlated
   with gene expression data in LP (R=-0.34, P=.032). The mean of
   methylation of PPAR alpha over CpG sites from nt -220 to -11 was
   significantly increased in the LP group compared with CO (P=.043). These
   data suggest an influence of DNA methylation in nutrient-dependent
   transcriptional regulation of NR3C1, PPAR alpha and CYP2C34. (c) 2013

TI Modulation of the prolactin and the corticosterone stress responses: Do
   they tell the same story in a long-lived bird, the Cape petrel?
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Over the last decades, the corticosterone stress response has been
   suggested as a major physiological tool to understand what strategy an
   individual might adopt in response to environmental perturbations. More
   recently, another hormone related to parental care - prolactin - has
   been suggested as a complementary tool to investigate this question.
   Indeed, both of these hormones are affected by stressors and are
   involved in parental decisions, such as deserting the nest. Because of
   these similarities, it remains unclear what the functional distinction
   between the prolactin and corticosterone stress responses is. Here, we
   investigated whether natural variations of the corticosterone and
   prolactin stress responses are functionally linked in free-living Cape
   petrel (Daption capense) parents. If prolactin and corticosterone
   mediate the same functional response to a stressor and are the proxies
   of the same response, we predict that corticosterone and prolactin
   stress responses (I) will be modulated according to the same factors;
   (2) will affect reproductive performances in the same way; and, (3) of
   course, will be correlated. Contrary to these predictions, we found that
   the corticosterone and prolactin stress responses were respectively
   modulated according to body condition and breeding status. Moreover,
   prolactin levels, but not corticosterone levels, were related to
   hatching success in this species. Finally, we did not find any
   significant correlation between these two stress responses under any
   circumstances (failed breeders, incubating or chick rearing birds) and
   this result was overall supported by a review of the existing
   literature. Therefore, these two stress responses do not seem to be
   tightly linked and we believe that they may provide complementary pieces
   of information on parental investment in birds. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Arsenic and the Epigenome: Interindividual Differences in Arsenic
   Metabolism Related to Distinct Patterns of DNA Methylation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR TOXICOLOGY
AB Biotransformation of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is one of the factors that
   determines the character and magnitude of the diverse detrimental health
   effects associated with chronic iAs exposure, but it is unknown how iAs
   biotransformation may impact the epigenome. Here, we integrated analyses
   of genome-wide, gene-specific promoter DNA methylation levels of
   peripheral blood leukocytes with urinary arsenical concentrations of
   subjects from a region of Mexico with high levels of iAs in drinking
   water. These analyses revealed dramatic differences in DNA methylation
   profiles associated with concentrations of specific urinary metabolites
   of arsenic (As). The majority of individuals in this study had positive
   indicators of As-related disease, namely pre-diabetes mellitus or
   diabetes mellitus (DM). Methylation patterns of genes with known
   associations with DM were associated with urinary concentrations of

TI Physical Activity and Differential Methylation of Breast Cancer Genes
   Assayed from Saliva: A Preliminary Investigation
SO ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB Individuals who exercise are at lower risk for breast cancer and have
   better post-diagnosis outcomes. The biological mechanisms behind this
   association are unclear, but DNA methylation has been suggested.
   We developed a composite measure of DNA methylation across 45 CpG sites
   on genes selected a priori. We examined the association of this measure
   to self-reported physical activity and objectively measured
   cardiovascular fitness in a sample of healthy nonsmoking adults (n = 64)
   in an exercise promotion intervention.
   Individuals who were more physically fit and who exercised more minutes
   per week had lower levels of DNA methylation. Those who increased their
   minutes of physical activity over 12 months experienced decreases in DNA
   methylation.
   DNA methylation may be a mechanism linking exercise and cancer incidence
   and could serve as a biomarker for behavioral intervention trials.
   Studies with larger samples, objectively measured exercise, and more
   cancer-related markers are needed.

TI Opposite but analogous effects of road density on songbirds with
   contrasting habitat preferences
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB Roads are a widespread and growing form of habitat alteration, making
   their effects on wildlife a major conservation concern. We investigated
   effects of roads on occupancy patterns and stress physiology of the
   golden-cheeked warbler Setophaga chrysoparia, an endangered songbird
   that depends on large tracts of old-growth forest for breeding. We
   compared those effects in the white-eyed vireo Vireo griseus, a common
   songbird that prefers to breed in scrubby habitat that is common along
   forest roads. In warblers, older, socially dominant males were more
   likely to occupy territories, but had higher baseline plasma
   concentrations of corticosterone, in less-roaded habitats. In vireos,
   older males were equally likely to occupy territories, but, opposite to
   warblers, had lower baseline corticosterone concentrations, in
   less-roaded habitats. In both species, the corticosterone response to
   acute stress was unrelated to road density, and body condition and fat
   stores either increased or were sustained across road density groups
   during the breeding season, suggesting that breeding near roads did not
   cause chronic stress. Our results suggest that roads can cause increased
   malemale competition for territories in nearby roadless habitat, and may
   result in higher corticosterone concentrations in dominant individuals
   defending preferred sites near or far from edge, depending on species
   habitat preferences. Increased competition and chronically elevated
   corticosterone levels may be of concern if they alter parental care or
   immunity of individuals breeding in the best habitat.

TI Catechin induced modulation in the activities of thyroid hormone
   synthesizing enzymes leading to hypothyroidism
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Catechins, the flavonoids found in abundance in green tea, have many
   beneficial health effects such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic,
   anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and hypotensive properties. However,
   flavonoids have antithyroid/goitrogenic effect, although less
   information is available about the effect of pure catechin on thyroid
   physiology. The present investigation has been undertaken to explore the
   effect of catechin administration on thyroid physiology in rat model.
   For the in vivo experiment catechin was injected intraperitoneally
   (i.p.) at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg body to male albino rats for 15
   and 30 days, respectively, and thyroid activities were evaluated with
   respect to determination of serum levels of thyroid hormones, thyroid
   peroxidase, 5'-deiodinase I (5'-DI), and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities
   that are involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Catechin
   decreased the activities of thyroid peroxidase and thyroidal
   5'-deiodinase I, while Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity significantly
   increased in dose-dependent manner; substantial decrease in serum T3 and
   T4 levels coupled with significant elevation of serum TSH were also
   noted. Histological examinations of the thyroid gland revealed marked
   hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of the thyroid follicles with depleted
   colloid content. In in vitro study, short-term exposure of rat thyroid
   tissue to catechin at the concentrations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 mg/ml
   leads to decrease in the activities of thyroid peroxidase and
   5'-deiodinase I, while the activity of thyroidal Na(+), K(+)-ATPase
   remains unaltered even at high concentration of catechin treatment. The
   present study reinforces the concept that catechin, tea flavonoids
   possess potent antithyroid activity as evidenced from in vivo and in
   vitro studies.

TI BORIS, Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites, Is Aberrantly
   Expressed in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO GENETIC TESTING AND MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS
AB Background: The brother of the regulator of imprinted sites (BORIS) is a
   novel member of the cancer testis antigen gene family, which are
   normally expressed only in spermatocytes, but abnormally activated in
   different malignancies. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the
   expression of BORIS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its
   correlation with the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of HCC.
   Methods: We investigated BORIS expression in HCC cell lines and 105
   primary HCC clinical surgical specimens using real-time polymerase chain
   reaction and Western blot analysis. We further examined the correlation
   of BORIS with a liver stem cell marker (CD90) in HCC tissues by
   histochemical double staining. The correlation of BORIS with
   clinicopathologic features and prognosis of HCC was analyzed using
   patient data. Results: The expression of BORIS was found in SMMC-7721,
   BEL-7402, and Huh-7, but not in hep-G2 cells. The expression rate of
   BORIS was significantly higher in the HCC tissues than in the adjacent
   noncancerous tissues (p=0.000). BORIS expression was correlated with the
   tumor size (p=0.000), CD90 expression (p=0.000), and satellite nodule
   (p=0.000). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with
   positive expression of BORIS had lower overall survival rate (p=0.003).
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that BORIS may be an auxiliary diagnosis
   index and a novel favorable prognostic indicator of HCC.

TI The methylation landscape of tumour metastasis
SO BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB The metastatic cascade which leads to the death of cancer patients
   results from a multi-step process of tumour progression caused by
   genetic and epigenetic alterations in key regulatory molecules. It is,
   therefore, crucial to improve our understanding of the regulation of
   genes controlling the metastatic process to identify predictive
   biomarkers and to develop more effective therapies to treat advanced
   disease. The study of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation offers a
   novel approach for innovative diagnosis and treatment of cancer
   patients. Recent discoveries provide compelling evidence that the
   methylation landscape (changes in both DNA methylation and histone
   post-translational modifications) is profoundly altered in cancer cells
   and contributes to the altered expression of genes regulating tumour
   phenotypes. However, the impact of methylation events specifically on
   the advanced metastatic process is poorly understood compared with the
   initial oncogenic events. Moreover, the characterisation of a large
   number of histone-modifying enzymes has revealed their active roles in
   cancer progression, via the regulation of specific target genes
   controlling different metastatic phenotypes. Here, we discuss two main
   methylating events (DNA methylation and histone-tail methylation)
   involved in oncogenesis and metastasis formation. The potential
   reversibility of these molecular events makes them promising biomarkers
   of metastatic potential and potential therapeutic targets.

TI Poplar stems show opposite epigenetic patterns during winter dormancy
   and vegetative growth
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB In this study the identification of epigenetic marks of closed and open
   chromatin states has been performed by immunofluorescence in
   vibratome-thick sections from poplar stems, followed by quantification
   of the signal in a representative population of individual nuclei on a
   confocal microscope. Unlike other methods often used for detection of
   global DNA methylation levels, the procedure hereby proposed can be
   applied to a wide range of specimens regardless of the purity and yield
   of genomic DNA extraction and in a tissue-dependent manner. Using
   antibodies to 5-methylcytidine and acetylated lysine 8 of histone H4, as
   reliable indicators of transcription incompatible and compatible
   chromatin states, respectively, the influence of epigenetic regulation
   on differential gene expression during the growth and arrest periods in
   xylem and phloem tissues was assessed. The fluorescence signal of
   5-methylcytosine was significantly higher in winter as compared with
   summer. Conversely, the fluorescence signal for acetylated Lys 8 of
   histone H4 was significantly higher in summer than in winter in both
   tissues examined. Collectively, these results put forward an epigenetic
   control of winter dormancy in poplar stems.

TI Endothelial differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells is
   improved by epigenetic modifying drug BIX-01294
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB Chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in regulation of gene
   transcription. Consequently, targeted changes in chromatin may also
   augment pluripotency of somatic cells. The aim of the present study was
   to evaluate the effect of epigenetic drug BIX-01294 (BIX), a histone G9a
   inhibitor, on DNA methylation, expression of pluripotency genes POU5F1
   (isoform a), NANOG, KLF4, and CMYC in mesenchymal stem cells, and the
   ability to increase their differentiation potential into endothelial
   cells (ECs). Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) were
   isolated from abdominal adipose tissue. Cells were pre-treated with BIX
   for 48 h and further differentiated in endothelial medium for 7 and 14
   days. Global DNA methylation was determined by MethyLight application,
   expression of genes for pluripotency, endothelial and angiogenic markers
   by SYBRGreen-based real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and
   immunobloting. Following treatment with BIX, DNA methylation status of
   AdMSCs was significantly reduced by 53% (p = 0.008), the expression of
   POU5F1 and NANOG was increased by 2.2-fold (p = 0.016) and 1.5-fold (p <
   0.001), respectively. Furthermore, BIX pre-treatment improved the
   differentiation capacity of AdMSCs into ECs and significantly increased
   expression of several endothelial markers and factors involved in blood
   vessel formation: VCAM-1, PECAM-1, von Willebrand factor, VEGFR-2, PDGF,
   and ANG-1 in comparison with AdMSCs without BIX pre-treatment. In the
   present study we demonstrate that epigenetic modifying drug BIX-01294 is
   able to increase the ability of AdMSCs to differentiate into ECs
   engaging DNA and histone methylation. Hence, BIX-01294 might serve as a
   simple tool to increase the differentiation potential of AdMSCs. (c)

TI Ethanol Induces Epigenetic Modulation of Prodynorphin and Pronociceptin
   Gene Expression in the Rat Amygdala Complex
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB Several studies demonstrated the role of the endogenous opioid system in
   the development of susceptibility to alcohol dependence. Recently, we
   reported that binge intragastric administration of ethanol induces
   selective alterations of pronociceptin and prodynorphin gene expression
   in the rat amygdala complex depending on the days of exposures and on
   the development of tolerance and dependence. The aim of the present
   study was to investigate the potential epigenetic mechanisms leading to
   these alcohol-induced changes in gene expression. Specific histone
   modifications and DNA methylation at opioid peptide precursor promoters
   were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time
   methylation-specific PCR, respectively. We found a linkage between gene
   expression alterations and epigenetic modulation at pronociceptin and
   prodynorphin promoters following alcohol treatment. In animals treated
   for 1 day, we observed a reversed correlation, with a decrease of
   histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (repressive mark) and an increase of
   histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (activating mark), associated with both
   gene expression up-regulation. In rats treated with alcohol for up to 5
   days, we found an increase in histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation in the
   pronociceptin promoter providing further evidence of the already
   proposed possible role for histone deacetylases for addiction treatment.
   No significant alterations in DNA methylation and histone 3 lysine 4
   trimethylation following different alcohol exposures were present,
   suggesting the selectivity of epigenetic effects induced by alcohol.
   These data demonstrate that ethanol induces selective epigenetic
   changes, thus better defining the role of opioid peptides in the
   ethanol-induced effects in the amygdala complex.

TI Carry-over effects of delayed larval metamorphosis on early juvenile
   performance in the mangrove crab Ucides cordatus (Ucididae)
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
AB Competent larvae of most benthic marine invertebrates including
   brachyuran decapod crustaceans can delay their settlement and
   metamorphosis in the absence of suitable environmental cues. This
   however may carry significant costs for the post-larval performance and
   fitness of early benthic juveniles. In this paper, we examined in the
   laboratory whether delayed larval metamorphosis affects early juvenile
   performance of the mangrove crab Ucides cordatus, measured as survival
   and growth through the first five juvenile crab stages (JI-JV). We
   further investigated whether 'carry-over' effects of an extended larval
   period vary intraspecifically among juveniles from three different
   hatches (F1-F3). Ucides megalopae were cultivated in two treatments. In
   the first one, the control, megalopae were cultivated continuously in
   exposure to conspecific crab odours (adult-conditioned seawater = ACSW)
   until moulting to the first juvenile crab stage. In the second, the
   delay-treatment, settlement-competent megalopae were kept for 20 days in
   pure filtered seawater without metamorphosis-triggering odours. From day
   21 onwards, megalopae were transferred to ACSW to induce larval moult.
   The results showed that delayed metamorphosis affects early juvenile
   survival and growth of U. cord at us. In the delay-treatment, survival
   rates of juveniles (JI-JV) from F1-F3 were 11-31% lower and intermoult
   development periods 1.5-4.2 days longer than in the control. Delayed
   juveniles (F1-F3) exhibited 9.2-14.1% smaller body sizes (carapace
   width) and 1.4-3.9% lower growth rates mostly in the first two moulting
   events compared to specimens derived from non-delayed megalopae. Most of
   the detrimental effects were observed in almost all five crab stages
   studied, indicating that the costs of delayed metamorphosis may persist
   throughout early juvenile development. Juvenile morphology, however, was
   not affected. Our study also showed that carry-over effects of delayed
   larval moult vary intraspecifically among offspring produced by
   different females. This plasticity in phenotypic effects could relate to
   differences in the nutritional state, health or age of the females, to
   stressful environments during embryogenesis or to genetic differences.
   The observed carry-over effects of delayed settlement on early juvenile
   performance may affect the overall recruitment success and population
   dynamics of U. cordatus. In the field, such a situation would appear
   when new mangrove areas void of conspecific crabs are colonized or when
   degraded sites are re-populated by larvae originating from elsewhere
   populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Extensive histone post-translational modification in honey bees
SO INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Histone post-translational modifications (FTMs) play a key role in
   regulating a variety of cellular processes including the establishment,
   maintenance and reversal of transcriptional programmes in eukaryotes.
   However, little is known about such modifications in the economically
   and ecologically important insect pollinator, the honey bee (Apis
   mellifera). Using mass spectrometry approaches, we show that histone
   H3.1, H3.3 and H4 of the honey bee are extensively modified by lysine
   acetylation and lysine methylation. We analysed histones isolated from
   queen ovaries and 96 hr-old larvae, in toto we quantified 23 specific
   modification states on 23 distinct peptides. In addition, we have
   identified and characterised patterns of histone PTMs that reside on the
   same peptide, generating detailed combinatorial information. Overall, we
   observed similar profiles of histone FTMs in both samples, with
   combinatorial patterns of lysine methylations on H3K27 and H3K36 more
   frequently identified in histones extracted from queen ovaries than from
   larvae. To our knowledge, this comprehensive dataset represents the
   first identification and quantitation of histone PTMs in this eusocial
   insect and emerging epigenetic model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Effects of chronic treatment with corticosterone and imipramine on fos
   immunoreactivity and adult hippocampal neurogenesis
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB In a previous study we showed that rats chronically treated with
   corticosterone (CORT) display anxiogenic behavior, evidenced by
   facilitation of avoidance responses in the elevated T-maze (ETM) model
   of anxiety. Treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine
   significantly reversed the anxiogenic effects of CURT, while inhibiting
   ETM escape, a response related to panic disorder. To better understand
   the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects,
   analysis of c-fos protein immunoreactivity (fos-ir) was used here to map
   areas activated by chronic CORT (200 mg pellets, 21-day release) and
   imipramine (15 mg/kg, IP) administration. We also evaluated the number
   of cells expressing the neurogenesis marker doublecortin (DCX) in the
   hippocampus and measured plasma CURT levels on the 21st day of
   treatment. Results showed that CURT increased fos-ir in the
   ventrolateral septum, medial amygdala and paraventricular hypothalamic
   nucleus and decreased fos-ir in the lateral periaqueductal gray.
   Imipramine, on the other hand, increased fos-ir in the medial amygdala
   and decreased fos-ir in the anterior hypothalamus. CURT also decreased
   the number of DCX-positive cells in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus,
   an effect antagonized by imipramine. CURT levels were significantly
   higher after treatment. These data suggest that the behavioral effects
   of CURT and imipramine are mediated through specific, at times
   overlapping, neuronal circuits, which might be of relevance to a better
   understanding of the physiopathology of generalized anxiety and panic
   disorder. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha and TRbeta expression in breast
   cancer
SO HISTOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY
AB There is evidence that breast cancer patients suffer from thyroid
   disorders. However, the relation between thyroid receptor (TR)
   expression and breast cancer remains unknown so far. Therefore, the aim
   of this study was an immunohistochemical analysis of TR expression in
   breast cancer patients.
   Materials and methods: The expression of the combined antibody TRalpha1
   and 2 and TRalpha1 or 2 alone as well as the expression of combined
   TRbeta1 and 2 and TRbeta1 or 2 alone was investigated with specific
   monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in 82 patients. All patients
   presented with a first diagnosis of sporadic breast cancer. The ABC
   method was used for staining and staining intensities were analyzed
   using the IRS score.
   Results: Both TRalpha and TRbeta were expressed in the nuclei of breast
   cancer cells. In 24% (28/78) of the slides TRalpha1 and 2 IRS was
   positive. Immuno-positivity for TRalpha1 was found in 55/78 slides, for
   TRalpha 2 in 54/79 slides (71 and 68%, respectively). The expression of
   TRbeta1 and 2 showed a positive detection in 33/77 (43%) of the slides,
   for TRbeta1 it was 43/79 (54%), for TRbeta2 60/76 (79%).
   Significant correlations of the expression of TRs - especially TRalpha2
   - were found with further prognostic histopathological parameters such
   as tumor size, axillary lymph node involvement, grading and hormone
   receptor status. Multivariate analysis showed a trend for TRalpha2 as an
   independent predictor of disease-free and overall survival.
   Discussion: Our results revealed specific alterations in the expression
   of TRs - especially of TRalpha2 - in breast cancer patients, suggesting
   it as a marker with possible prognostic validity.

TI Epigenetic silencing of miR-335 and its host gene MEST in hepatocellular
   carcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous
   silencers of target genes. Some tumor-suppressive miRNAs are known to be
   epigenetically silenced by promoter DNA methylation in cancer. In the
   present study, we aimed to identify miRNA genes that are silenced by DNA
   hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We screened for
   miRNA genes with promoter DNA hypermethylation using a genome-wide
   methylation microarray analysis in HCC cells. It was found that miR-335,
   which is harbored within an intron of its protein-coding host gene,
   MEST, was downregulated by aberrant promoter hypermethylation via
   further methylation assays, including methylation-specific PCR, combined
   bisulfite and restriction analysis, bisulfite sequencing analysis and
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. The expression levels of miR-335
   significantly correlated with those of MEST, supporting the notion that
   the intronic miR-335 is co-expressed with its host gene. The levels of
   miR-335/MEST methylation were significantly higher in 18 (90%) out of 20
   primary HCC tumors, compared to their non-tumor tissue counterparts
   (P<0.001). The expression levels of miR-335 were significantly lower in
   25 (78%) out of 32 primary HCC tumors, compared to their non-tumor
   tissue counterparts (P=0.001). Furthermore, the expression levels of
   miR-335 were significantly lower in HCC tumors with distant metastasis
   compared to those without distant metastasis (P=0.02). In conclusion,
   our results indicate that expression of miR-335 is reduced by aberrant
   DNA methylation in HCC.

TI Recruitment of NCOR1 to VDR target genes is enhanced in prostate cancer
   cells and associates with altered DNA methylation patterns
SO CARCINOGENESIS
AB The current study investigated transcriptional distortion in prostate
   cancer cells using the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a tool to examine how
   epigenetic events driven by corepressor binding and CpG methylation lead
   to aberrant gene expression. These relationships were investigated in
   the non-malignant RWPE-1 cells that were 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)
   responsive (RWPE-1) and malignant cell lines that were 1 alpha,
   25(OH)(2)D(3) partially responsive (RWPE-2) and resistant (PC-3). These
   studies revealed that selective attenuation and repression of VDR
   transcriptional responses in the cancer cell lines reflected their loss
   of antiproliferative sensitivity. This was evident in VDR target genes
   including VDR, CDKN1A (encodes p21(waf1/cip1)) and GADD45A; NCOR1
   knockdown alleviated this malignant transrepression. ChIP assays in
   RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells revealed that transrepression of CDKN1A was
   associated with increased NCOR1 enrichment in response to 1 alpha,
   25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. These findings supported the concept that
   retained and increased NCOR1 binding, associated with loss of H3K9ac and
   increased H3K9me2, may act as a beacon for the initiation and
   recruitment of DNA methylation. Overexpressed histone methyltransferases
   (KMTs) were detectable in a wide panel of prostate cancer cell lines
   compared with RWPE-1 and suggested that generation of H3K9me2 states
   would be favored. Cotreatment of cells with the KMT inhibitor,
   chaetocin, increased 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) - mediated induction of
   CDKN1A expression supporting a role for this event to disrupt CDKN1A
   regulation. Parallel surveys in PC-3 cells of CpG methylation around the
   VDR binding regions on CDKN1A revealed altered basal and VDR-regulated
   DNA methylation patterns that overlapped with VDR-induced recruitment of
   NCOR1 and gene transrepression. Taken together, these findings suggest
   that sustained corepressor interactions with nuclear-resident
   transcription factors may inappropriately transform transient-repressive
   histone states into more stable and repressive DNA methylation events.

TI Energetic constraints and parental care: Is corticosterone indicative of
   energetic costs of incubation in a precocial bird?
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Suppression of the adrenocortical response (e.g., corticosterone
   release) to an acute stressor is a physiological adjustment thought to
   decrease the likelihood of avian parents abandoning their nests.
   However, some periods of parental care, like incubation, are
   energetically costly, thus corticosterone could increase during these
   stages to allow incubating parents to utilize energy reserves. Wood
   ducks (Aix sponsa) have similar to 30 day incubation periods and only
   the female incubates the eggs. We hypothesized that corticosterone would
   be important in regulating energy availability during incubation in this
   species. Because resources invested in reproduction increase with clutch
   size, we also hypothesized that clutch size would influence plasma
   corticosterone during incubation. We measured baseline and
   stress-induced corticosterone in incubating females during early and
   late stages of incubation. At both stages of incubation all hens had low
   baseline corticosterone levels. However, we found that stress-induced
   corticosterone was 105% greater late in incubation than early in
   incubation. We also detected a significant negative correlation between
   female body mass and stress-induced corticosterone late in incubation,
   but not during the early stages of incubation. Furthermore, we found a
   significant positive relationship between stress-induced corticosterone
   and clutch size. These lines of evidence support the hypothesis that
   incubation in wood ducks is energetically costly and corticosterone is
   important in supporting the energetic demands of incubating hens. Our
   findings suggest that corticosterone's role in supporting parental care
   behaviors are dynamic and are influenced by several factors and that
   there is a greater physiological cost associated with incubating larger
   clutches. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI The original Borda count and partial voting
SO SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE
AB In a Borda count, bc, M. de Borda suggested the last preference cast
   should receive 1 point, the voter's penultimate ranking should get 2
   points, and so on. Today, however, points are often awarded to (first,
   second,..., last) preferences cast as per (n, n-1, ..., 1) or more
   frequently, (n -1, n-2,..., 0). If partial voting is allowed, and if a
   first preference is to be given n or n - 1 points regardless of how many
   preferences the voter casts, he/she will be incentivised to rank only
   one option/candidate. If everyone acts in this way, the bc metamorphoses
   into a plurality vote... which de Borda criticized at length. If all the
   voters submit full ballots, the outcome-social choice or ranking-will be
   the same under any of the above three counting procedures. In the event
   of one or more persons submitting a partial vote, however, outcomes may
   vary considerably. This preliminary paper suggests research should
   consider partial voting. The author examines the consequences of the
   various rules so far advocated and then purports that M. de Borda, in
   using his formula, was perhaps more astute than the science has hitherto
   recognised.

TI Regulation and Function of DNA and Histone Methylations
SO CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB Cell type specification, transcription factor binding site selection and
   transcriptional regulation are specific processes that require a fine
   regulation that cannot be simply explained by the mere DNA sequence.
   Similarly, genome stability, damage response as well as genomic imprints
   and X-chromosome inactivation are all processes that involve an
   epigenetic level of regulation. This includes the activity of several
   enzymes that act in concert to "place" or "remove" specific
   modifications shaping cells epigenomes with posttranslational
   modifications of histone proteins and modifications of DNA cytosine
   residues. In this review, we discuss the role of histone and DNA
   methylation in regulating different cellular processes with a particular
   emphasis on transcriptional regulation and on the mechanistic insights
   behind different enzymatic activities with a perspective towards their
   implications in human diseases.

TI Proteomic Analysis Reveals Diverse Classes of Arginine Methylproteins in
   Mitochondria of Trypanosomes
SO MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS
AB Arginine (arg) methylation is a widespread posttranslational
   modification of proteins that impacts numerous cellular processes such
   as chromatin remodeling, RNA processing, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
   Known arg methylproteins arise mostly from yeast and mammals, and are
   almost exclusively nuclear and cytoplasmic. Trypanosoma brucei is an
   early branching eukaryote whose genome encodes five putative protein arg
   methyltransferases, and thus likely contains a plethora of arg
   methylproteins. Additionally, trypanosomes and related organisms possess
   a unique mitochondrion that undergoes dramatic developmental regulation
   and uses novel RNA editing and mitochondrial DNA replication mechanisms.
   Here, we performed a global mass spectrometric analysis of the T. brucei
   mitochondrion to identify new arg methylproteins in this medically
   relevant parasite. Enabling factors of this work are use of a
   combination digestion with two orthogonal enzymes, an efficient offline
   two dimensional chromatography separation, and high-resolution mass
   spectrometry analysis with two complementary activations. This approach
   led to the comprehensive, sensitive and confident identification and
   localization of methylarg at a proteome level. We identified 167 arg
   methylproteins with wide-ranging functions including metabolism,
   transport, chaperoning, RNA processing, translation, and DNA
   replication. Our data suggest that arg methylproteins in trypanosome
   mitochondria possess both trypanosome-specific and evolutionarily
   conserved modifications, depending on the protein targeted. This study
   is the first comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial arg methylation in
   any organism, and represents a significant advance in our knowledge of
   the range of arg methylproteins and their sites of modification.
   Moreover, these studies establish T. brucei as a model organism for the
   study of posttranslational modifications. Molecular & Cellular

TI Methylation levels of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) promoter in benign
   and malignant thyroid tumors with reduced NIS expression
SO ENDOCRINE
AB DNA methylation regulates gene expression. Aberrant methylation plays an
   important role in human tumorigenesis. We have previously detected
   reduced NIS mRNA expression in thyroid tumors as compared to non-tumor
   tissues. Thus, in this study we investigated whether the methylation of
   the CpG-island located in the NIS gene promoter was associated with
   reduced mRNA expression in thyroid tumors. Methylation levels of 30
   pairs of samples from 10 benign and 20 malignant thyroid tumors (T)
   along with matched non-tumor (NT) areas were determined by
   semiquantitative methylation specific-PCR. NIS methylation was detected
   in all samples. Methylation levels and frequencies did not differ
   between the groups and were not associated with BRAF mutational status.
   Highest methylation levels and frequencies were detected in the 5'
   region of the CpG-island decreasing toward the 3' end. Intraindividual
   analysis (T versus NT) showed high tumor methylation levels in 40 % of
   the samples in the benign group and 30 % in the malignant group,
   associated with low NIS mRNA expression. No quantitative correlation was
   detected between methylation levels and mRNA expression in any the
   groups. The results of this study showed that methylation of NIS
   promoter is a very frequent event in both benign and malignant tumors as
   well as in their surrounding tissues, and characterized a
   non-homogeneous methylation pattern along the CpG island. Therefore,
   further investigations involving other sites that may be implicated in
   methylation regulation of NIS expression are warranted.

TI Characterization of H3K9me3- and H4K20me3-associated circulating
   nucleosomal DNA by high-throughput sequencing in colorectal cancer
SO TUMOR BIOLOGY
AB Modified histone tails in nucleosomes circulating in the blood bear the
   potential as cancer biomarkers. Recently, using chromatin
   immunopecipitation (ChIP)-related quantitative PCR, we described reduced
   plasma levels of the two pericentric heterochromatin-specific histone
   methylation marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 in patients with colorectal
   cancer (CRC). Here, by utilizing ChIP-related high-throughput
   sequencing, we further characterized these modifications in circulation.
   Plasma DNA from nucleosomes immunoprecipitated by H3K9me3- and
   H4K20me3-specific antibodies from patients with CRC (N = 15) and healthy
   subjects (N = 15) was subjected to the Roche 454 FLX sequencing, and the
   generated array of ChIP-enriched sequences were compared to the human
   reference genome. The total number of nucleosomes, of sequence reads and
   of diverse DNA repetitive elements were statistically compared between
   the study groups. Total nucleosome amount was not different in both
   groups. Concerning both histone modifications, lower numbers of sequence
   reads were detected in CRC patients as compared with healthy controls
   (medians in H3K9me3: 32 vs. 61; p < 0.01; in H4K20me3: 54 vs. 88; p <
   0.01). Size of fragments was not different in both groups. Most abundant
   sequences were repetitive LINE and SINE elements while simple repeats,
   LTR, DNA, SAT, and low complexity elements were less frequent. Best
   discrimination between both groups was achieved by total number of
   H3K9me3 reads (AUC 0.90) and H3K9me3 LINE elements L1 (AUC 0.93) und L2
   (AUC 0.91). The present results confirm earlier findings of lower
   H3K9me3 levels in CRC and show LINE elements to be the most frequent and
   best discriminative markers on modified histones.

TI DNA Methylation Mediated Control of Gene Expression Is Critical for
   Development of Crown Gall Tumors
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Crown gall tumors develop after integration of the T-DNA of virulent
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains into the plant genome. Expression of
   the T-DNA-encoded oncogenes triggers proliferation and differentiation
   of transformed plant cells. Crown gall development is known to be
   accompanied by global changes in transcription, metabolite levels, and
   physiological processes. High levels of abscisic acid (ABA) in crown
   galls regulate expression of drought stress responsive genes and mediate
   drought stress acclimation, which is essential for wild-type-like tumor
   growth. An impact of epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation on
   crown gall development has been suggested; however, it has not yet been
   investigated comprehensively. In this study, the methylation pattern of
   Arabidopsis thaliana crown galls was analyzed on a genome-wide scale as
   well as at the single gene level. Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed
   that the oncogenes Ipt, IaaH, and IaaM were unmethylated in crown galls.
   Nevertheless, the oncogenes were susceptible to siRNA-mediated
   methylation, which inhibited their expression and subsequently crown
   gall growth. Genome arrays, hybridized with methylated DNA obtained by
   immunoprecipitation, revealed a globally hypermethylated crown gall
   genome, while promoters were rather hypomethylated. Mutants with reduced
   non-CG methylation developed larger tumors than the wild-type controls,
   indicating that hypermethylation inhibits plant tumor growth. The
   differential methylation pattern of crown galls and the stem tissue from
   which they originate correlated with transcriptional changes. Genes
   known to be transcriptionally inhibited by ABA and methylated in crown
   galls became promoter methylated upon treatment of A. thaliana with ABA.
   This suggests that the high ABA levels in crown galls may mediate DNA
   methylation and regulate expression of genes involved in drought stress
   protection. In summary, our studies provide evidence that epigenetic
   processes regulate gene expression, physiological processes, and the
   development of crown gall tumors.

TI ADP-ribose polymer depletion leads to nuclear Ctcf re-localization and
   chromatin rearrangement
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Ctcf (CCCTC-binding factor) directly induces Parp [poly(ADP-ribose)
   polymerase] 1 activity and its PARylation [poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation] in
   the absence of DNA damage. Ctcf, in turn, is a substrate for this
   post-synthetic modification and as such it is covalently and
   non-covalently modified by PARs (ADP-ribose polymers). Moreover,
   PARylation is able to protect certain DNA regions bound by Ctcf from DNA
   methylation. We recently reported that de novo methylation of Ctcf
   target sequences due to overexpression of Parg
   [poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase] induces loss of Ctcf binding.
   Considering this, we investigate to what extent PARP activity is able to
   affect nuclear distribution of Ctcf in the present study. Notably, Ctcf
   lost its diffuse nuclear localization following PAR (ADP-ribose polymer)
   depletion and accumulated at the periphery of the nucleus where it was
   linked with nuclear pore complex proteins remaining external to the
   perinuclear Lamin B1 ring. We demonstrated that PAR depletion-dependent
   perinuclear localization of Ctcf was due to its blockage from entering
   the nucleus. Besides Ctcf nuclear delocalization, the outcome of PAR
   depletion led to changes in chromatin architecture. Immunofluorescence
   analyses indicated DNA redistribution, a generalized genomic
   hypermethylation and an increase of inactive compared with active
   chromatin marks in Parg-overexpressing or Ctcf-silenced cells. Together
   these results underline the importance of the cross-talk between Parp1
   and Ctcf in the maintenance of nuclear organization.

TI Plasticity in Dnmt3L-dependent and -independent modes of de novo
   methylation in the developing mouse embryo
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB A stimulatory DNA methyltransferase co-factor, Dnmt3L, has evolved in
   mammals to assist the process of de novo methylation, as genetically
   demonstrated in the germline. The function of Dnmt3L in the early embryo
   remains unresolved. By combining developmental and genetic approaches,
   we find that mouse embryos begin development with a maternal store of
   Dnmt3L, which is rapidly degraded and does not participate in embryonic
   de novo methylation. A zygotic-specific promoter of Dnmt3l is activated
   following gametic methylation loss and the potential recruitment of
   pluripotency factors just before implantation. Importantly, we find that
   zygotic Dnmt3L deficiency slows down the rate of de novo methylation in
   the embryo by affecting methylation density at some, but not all,
   genomic sequences. Dnmt3L is not strictly required, however, as
   methylation patterns are eventually established in its absence, in the
   context of increased Dnmt3A protein availability. This study proves that
   the postimplantation embryo is more plastic than the germline in terms
   of DNA methylation mechanistic choices and, importantly, that de novo
   methylation can be achieved in vivo without Dnmt3L.

TI Developmental Changes in Desensitisation of c-Fos Expression Induced by
   Repeated Maternal Separation in Pre-Weaned Mice
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Early-life stress has long-lasting effects on neuroendocrine and
   behaviour in adulthood. Maternal separation (MS) is used as a model of
   early-life stress and daily repeated MS (RMS) for 3 h during the first
   two postnatal weeks is widely used in rodent studies. However, it is not
   fully understood whether early-life animals desensitise/habituate to
   repeated stress. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   daily RMS for 3 h and acute/single time MS (SMS) for 3 h on the plasma
   corticosterone level and c-Fos expression in the brain in mice at
   different postnatal ages. Mice were subjected to: (i) RMS from postnatal
   day (PND) 1 to 14 (RMS14); (ii) RMS from PND14 to 21 (RMS21); (iii) SMS
   on PND14 (SMS14); and (iv) SMS on PND21 (SMS21). Plasma corticosterone
   and c-Fos expression were examined on the final day in each experiment.
   The basal corticosterone levels in RMS14 and RMS21 were equal to those
   in respective age-matched controls. After the final separation, the
   levels were significantly increased and were comparable with those after
   SMS14 and SMS21, respectively. Histological analysis indicated that
   c-Fos expression significantly increased in many brain regions,
   including the paraventricular nucleus, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus,
   and basolateral and medial amygdale in both SMS14 and SMS21 mice.
   However, c-Fos expression in RMS14 mice significantly increased in many
   regions, whereas such increases were hardly seen in RMS21 mice. These
   results indicate that repeated early-life stress neither increases basal
   corticosterone, nor decreases the magnitude of the corticosterone
   response during the first three postnatal weeks, although
   desensitisation of c-Fos expression induced by repeated stress is
   changed during postnatal development.

TI LINE-1 methylation in peripheral blood and the risk of melanoma in
   melanoma-prone families with and without CDKN2A mutations
SO MELANOMA RESEARCH
AB Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is an etiologically heterogenous
   disease with genetic, environmental (sun exposure), and host
   (pigmentation/nevi) factors and their interactions contributing to risk.
   Recently, epigenetic changes involving reduced levels of global DNA
   methylation in blood have been associated with genomic instability and
   cancer risk. We thus examined whether global methylation was associated
   with CMM risk in individuals from melanoma-prone families with and
   without CDKN2A germline mutations. We measured global DNA methylation
   using bisulfite pyrosequencing at four CpG sites of the long
   interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) sequences in peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals in 64 melanoma-prone families
   including 114 CMM cases (45 CDKN2A-positive and 69 CDKN2A-negative) and
   121 unaffected individuals (31 CDKN2A-positive and 90 CDKN2A-negative).
   We used unconditional logistic regression to evaluate the association
   between CMM status and LINE-1 methylation levels, adjusting for age at
   blood draw and accounting for familial correlation in the variance. We
   found that male sex was significantly associated with higher overall
   LINE-1 methylation (P = 0.0001). However, the overall and site-specific
   levels of LINE-1 methylation did not vary significantly by CMM status

TI Complex epigenetic regulation of Engrailed-2 (EN-2) homeobox gene in the
   autism cerebellum
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB The elucidation of epigenetic alterations in the autism brain has
   potential to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms
   underlying abnormal gene expression in this disorder. Given strong
   evidence that engrailed-2 (EN-2) is a developmentally expressed gene
   relevant to cerebellar abnormalities and autism, the epigenetic
   evaluation of this candidate gene was undertaken in 26 case and control
   post-mortem cerebellar samples. Assessments included global DNA
   methylation, EN-2 promoter methylation, EN-2 gene expression and EN-2
   protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to evaluate
   trimethylation status of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) associated with
   gene downregulation and histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) associated with gene
   activation. The results revealed an unusual pattern of global and EN-2
   promoter region DNA hypermethylation accompanied by significant
   increases in EN-2 gene expression and protein levels. Consistent with
   EN-2 overexpression, histone H3K27 trimethylation mark in the EN-2
   promoter was significantly decreased in the autism samples relative to
   matched controls. Supporting a link between reduced histone H3K27
   trimethylation and increased EN-2 gene expression, the mean level of
   histone H3K4 trimethylation was elevated in the autism cerebellar
   samples. Together, these results suggest that the normal EN-2
   downregulation that signals Purkinje cell maturation during late
   prenatal and early-postnatal development may not have occurred in some
   individuals with autism and that the postnatal persistence of EN-2
   overexpression may contribute to autism cerebellar abnormalities.

TI Repeatedly stressed rats have enhanced vulnerability to amygdala
   kindling epileptogenesis
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Psychiatric disorders associated with elevated stress levels, such as
   depression, are present in many epilepsy patients, including those with
   mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (mTLE). Evidence suggests that these
   psychiatric disorders can predate the onset of epilepsy, suggesting a
   causal/contributory role. Prolonged exposure to elevated corticosterone,
   used as a model of chronic stress/depression, accelerates limbic
   epileptogenesis in the amygdala kindling model. The current study
   examined whether exposure to repeated stress could similarly accelerate
   experimental epileptogenesis. Female adult non-epileptic Wistar rats
   were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala, and were
   randomly assigned into stressed (n = 18) or non-stressed (n = 19)
   groups. Rats underwent conventional amygdala kindling (two electrical
   stimulations per day) until 5 Class V seizures had been experienced
   ('the fully kindled state'). Stressed rats were exposed to 30 min
   restraint immediately prior to each kindling stimulation, whereas
   non-stressed rats received control handling. Restraint stress increased
   circulating corticosterone levels (pre-stress: 122 +/- 17 ng/ml;
   post-stress: 632 +/- 33 ng/ml), with no habituation observed over the
   experiment. Stressed rats reached the 'fully kindled state' in
   significantly fewer stimulations than non-stressed rats (21 1 vs 33 +/-
   3 stimulations; p = 0.022; ANOVA), indicative of a vulnerability to
   epileptogenesis. Further, seizure durations were significantly longer in
   stressed rats (p < 0.001; ANOVA). These data demonstrate that exposure
   to repeated experimental stress accelerates the development of limbic
   epileptogenesis, an effect which may be related to elevated
   corticosterone levels. This may have implications for understanding the
   effects of chronic stress and depression in disease onset and
   progression of mTLE in humans. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Influences of Zero-Valent Sulfur on Mercury Methylation in Bacterial
   Cocultures
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB The speciation of mercury (Hg) is a major determinant of its methylation
   rate by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), considered the primary
   methylators. Under anoxic conditions, sulfur (S) cycling may have a
   significant influence on Hg complexation and methylation, by influencing
   both SRB activity and the pool of available reduced S ligands, as the
   presence of zero-valent sulfur (S(0)) in sulfidic water results in the
   formation of polysulfides. While SRB frequently coexist with S-oxidizing
   bacteria in natural environments, the effect that these organisms may
   have on methylation by SRB is not understood. In this study, we
   investigate the role of S(0) in methylation by SRB monocultures and
   cocultures with phototrophic green or purple S-oxidizing bacteria. In
   the coculture experiments, the presence of S-oxidizers was found to
   increase Hg methylation rates, apparently by maintaining favorable
   chemical speciation in the environment. The measured Hg methylation
   rates were in accord with predictions based on geochemical modeling of
   speciation. In SRB monoculture experiments conducted in the presence and
   absence of S(0), the data showed that at limited total Hg, the presence
   of polysulfides resulted in decreased Hg methylation, presumably by
   causing a decrease in the most bioavailable Hg-sulfide complexes. These
   results indicate that models of Hg speciation and methylation in the
   environment should include a detailed investigation of S redox
   speciation.

TI CTCF Regulates Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Latency
   Transcription by Nucleosome Displacement and RNA Polymerase Programming
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been implicated in various aspects of
   viral and host chromatin organization and transcriptional control. We
   showed previously that CTCF binds to a cluster of three sites in the
   first intron of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
   multicistronic latency-associated transcript that encodes
   latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), viral cyclin (vCyclin),
   vFLIP, viral microRNAs, and kaposin. We show here that these CTCF
   binding sites regulate mRNA production, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)
   programming, and nucleosome organization of the KSHV latency transcript
   control region. We also show that KSHV bacmids lacking these CTCF
   binding sites have elevated and altered ratios of spliced latency
   transcripts. CTCF binding site mutations altered RNAPII and
   RNAPII-accessory factor interactions with the latency control region.
   CTCF binding sites were required for the in vitro recruitment of RNAPII
   to the latency control region, suggesting that direct interactions
   between CTCF and RNAPII contribute to transcription regulation. Histone
   modifications in the latency control region were also altered by
   mutations in the CTCF binding sites. Finally, we show that CTCF binding
   alters the regular phasing of nucleosomes in the latency gene transcript
   and intron, suggesting that nucleosome positioning can be an underlying
   biochemical mechanism of CTCF function. We propose that RNAPII
   interactions and nucleosome displacement serve as a biochemical basis
   for programming RNAPII in the KSHV transcriptional control region.

TI Intermediate- and Low-Methylation Epigenotypes Do Not Correspond to CpG
   Island Methylator Phenotype (Low and -Zero) in Colorectal Cancer
SO CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
AB Background: Most recent genome-wide studies on the CpG island
   methylation in colorectal cancer (CRC) have led to the discovery of at
   least 3 distinct methylation clusters. However, there remains an
   uncertainty whether the CRC clusters identified in these studies
   represent compatible phenotypes.
   Methods: We carried out comprehensive genome-scale DNA methylation
   profiling by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 of 21 DNA pools that
   represent 84 CRC samples divided according to their high-,
   intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME,
   respectively) and 70 normal-adjacent colonic tissues. We have also
   examined the relationship among 3 epigenotypes and chromosomal gains and
   deletions (assessed by Comparative Genomic Hybridization) in a group of
   100 CRC samples.
   Results: The HME subgroup showed features associated with CpG island
   methylator phenotype - high (CIMP-high) including methylation of
   specific CpG sites (CpGs) as well as significantly lower mean number of
   chromosomal imbalances when compared with other epigenotypes. The IME
   subgroup displayed the lowest number of methylated CpGs (717 vs. 2,399
   and 2,679 in HME and LME, respectively) and highest mean number of
   chromosomal imbalances when compared with HME (P, 0.001) and LME (P,
   0.004). A comparison between the methylation profiles of 3 epigenotypes
   revealed more similarities between the HME and LME (1,669 methylated
   CpGs overlapped) than HME and IME (673 methylated CpGs overlapped).
   Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that IME and LME CRCs show
   opposite features to those that have been previously attributed to
   CIMP-low and CIMP-0 CRCs.
   Impact: These discrepancies should be considered when interpreting the
   data from a particular epigenotyping method. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers

TI Feather coloration in museum specimens is related to feather
   corticosterone
SO BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB Colorful ornaments in birds are often sexually selected signals of
   quality, and variation in ornament expression may be mediated by
   physiological stress through the secretion of corticosterone. However,
   testing for links between ornamentation and corticosterone often
   requires sampling live animals, and such physiological measures may not
   be matched in the time span in which they were sampled (e.g., very
   dynamic plasma corticosterone vs. plumage coloration, which is
   relatively static). Here, we use museum specimens to test for a link
   between the color of a sexual ornament and feather corticosterone at the
   time of ornament formation. In red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius
   phoeniceus, carotenoid-based epaulets appear to be important in
   male-male social interactions, territory maintenance, and female choice.
   We measured reflectance spectra of adult male epaulets and plucked
   adjacent feathers for corticosterone analysis via radioimmunoassay. We
   controlled for differences in the number of mates, specimen age, and
   geography by selecting only males with one mate and only birds collected
   in Florida during a 3-year period. Epaulet hue and red chroma did not
   vary with feather corticosterone, but males whose epaulets scored high
   for mean brightness and red brightness had significantly lower
   corticosterone than males with low brightness scores. This correlation
   with brightness but not hue or chroma is consistent with an effect of
   corticosterone (CORT) on feather microstructure, with elevated CORT
   leading to lower reflectance of white light from the keratin matrix
   surrounding the carotenoid pigments.

TI Arabidopsis histone methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP2 is required for
   regulation of various hormone responsive genes
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Histone modifications are known to play important roles in plant
   development through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. How these
   modifications regulate downstream targets in response to various
   environmental cues and developmental stimuli is still largely unknown.
   Here, we provide evidence that Arabidopsis histone H3K4
   methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2) is required for full
   activation of hormone responsive genes upon hormone treatment. The
   pleiotropic phenotypes of sdg2 were closely related to those of auxin
   deficient mutants and RNA analysis revealed that expression of early
   hormone responsive genes was significantly reduced in sdg2-5. By ChIP
   analyses we found that H3K4 tri-methylations on chromatin region of
   hormone responsive genes such as SAUR27, KIN1 and GASA6 were enriched in
   WT upon hormone treatments whereas these enrichments were largely
   abolished in sdg2-5. After hormone treatment, chromatin regions of
   responsive genes that accumulated H3K4me3 in WT overlapped with those
   displaying decreased H3K4me3 levels in sdg2-5. Histone H3K4
   di-methylation levels on tested genes were increased rather than
   decreased in sdg2-5, suggesting that SDG2 mediates transition of H3K4me2
   to H3K4me3. Taken together, we conclude that the SDG2 activity is
   required to regulate the expression of hormone responsive genes via
   histone H3K4 tri-methylation.

TI Epigenetic aspects of HP1 exchange kinetics in apoptotic chromatin
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Apoptotic bodies are the most condensed form of chromatin. In general,
   chromatin structure and function are mostly dictated by histone
   post-translational modifications. Thus, we have analyzed the histone
   signature in apoptotic cells, characterized by pronounced chromatin
   condensation. Here, H2B mono-acetylation, and H3K9 and H4 acetylation
   was significantly decreased in apoptotic cells, which maintained a high
   level of H3K9 methylation. This phenotype was independent of p53
   function and distinct levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein.
   Interestingly, after etoposide treatment of leukemia and multiple
   myeloma cells, H3K9 and H4 hypoacetylation was accompanied by increased
   H3K9me2, but not H3K9me1 or H3K9me3. In adherent mouse fibroblasts, a
   high level of H3K9me3 and histone deacetylation in apoptotic bodies was
   likely responsible for the pronounced (similar to 40%) recovery of
   GFP-HP1 alpha and GFP-HP1 beta after photobleaching. HP1 mobility in
   apoptotic cells appeared to be unique because limited exchange after
   photobleaching was observed for other epigenetically important proteins,
   including GFP-JMJD2b histone demethylase (similar to 10% fluorescence
   recovery) or Polycomb group-related GFP-BMI1 protein (similar to 20%
   fluorescence recovery). These findings imply a novel fact that only
   certain subset of proteins in apoptotic bodies is dynamic. (c) 2012

TI DNA methylation status is associated with the formation of heterosis in
   Larix kaempferi intraspecific hybrids
SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
AB Heterosis is prevalent in Larix kaempferi, but the molecular mechanism
   underlying heterosis in this species has not yet been elucidated. We
   have explored the relationships among heterosis and DNA sequence
   variations, changes in the DNA methylation status, and gene expression
   in a set of Larix kaempferi intraspecific parental lines and their
   reciprocal hybrids. The results indicate that the two intraspecific
   parental lines have highly similar genome structures and that the
   crosses did not produce substantial changes in the genomic DNA of the
   hybrid progeny. In contrast, there was a significant difference in the
   DNA methylation status between the two parental lines. The genomic DNA
   methylation level in the heterotic hybrids (26.47 %) was significantly
   lower than the midparent value (MPV) (33.80 %), indicating that
   significant extensive demethylation had occurred. However, the
   non-heterotic hybrids displayed a DNA methylation level (33.59 %) that
   was close to the MPV, and they contained similar numbers of methylation
   and demethylation events. The correlation analysis revealed that the
   increased gene expression in the heterotic hybrids was associated with
   its overall low genomic DNA methylation level and dynamic DNA
   methylation patterns. Twenty fragments with adjusted DNA methylation
   patterns were then cloned and the transcript level analyzed
   quantitatively. The results further indicated that the expressions of
   most but not all of the 12 possible genes were negatively correlated to
   their respective DNA methylation status. Based on these data, we suggest
   that adjustments in DNA methylation status may play critical roles in
   the formation of heterosis produced by the cross between two Larix
   kaempferi intraspecific parental lines.

TI PARP-2 regulates cell cycle-related genes through histone deacetylation
   and methylation independently of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP-2) catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
   (PARylation) and regulate numerous nuclear processes, including
   transcription. Depletion of PARP-2 alters the activity of transcription
   factors and global gene expression. However, the molecular action of how
   PARP-2 controls the transcription of target promoters remains unclear.
   Here we report that PARP-2 possesses transcriptional repression activity
   independently of its enzymatic activity. PARP-2 interacts and recruits
   histone deacetylases HDAC5 and HDAC7, and histone methyltransferase G9a
   to the promoters of cell cycle-related genes, generating repressive
   chromatin signatures. Our findings propose a novel mechanism of PARP-2
   in transcriptional regulation involving specific protein-protein

TI Like a rolling histone: Epigenetic regulation of neural stem cells and
   brain development by factors controlling histone acetylation and
   methylation
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS
AB Background: The development of the nervous system is a highly organized
   process involving the precise and coordinated timing of many complex
   events. These events require proper expression of genes promoting
   survival, differentiation, and maturation, but also repression of
   alternative cell fates and restriction of cell-type-specific gene
   expression.
   Scope of the review: As the enzymes mediating post-translational histone
   acetylation and methylation are regulating higher order chromatin
   structure and controlling gene transcription, knowledge of the roles for
   these enzymes becomes crucial for understanding neural development and
   disease. The widespread expression and general biological roles for
   chromatin-modifying factors have hampered the studies of such enzymes in
   neural development, but in recent years, in vivo and in vitro studies
   have started to shed light on the various processes these enzymes
   regulate. In this review we summarize the implications of
   chromatin-modifying enzymes in neural development, with particular
   emphasis on enzymes regulating histone acetylation and methylation.
   Major conclusions: Enzymes controlling histone acetylation and
   methylation are involved in the whole process of neural development,
   from controlling proliferation and undifferentiated, "poised", state of
   stem cells to promoting and inhibiting neurogenic and gliogenic pathways
   and neuronal survival as well as neurite outgrowth.
   General significance: Aberrant enzymatic activities of histone acetyl
   transferases, deacetylases, and demethylases have been chemically and
   genetically associated with neural developmental disorders and cancer.
   Future studies may aim at linking the genetic and developmental studies
   to more in-depth biochemical characterization to provide a clearer
   picture of how to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of
   such disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled
   Biochemistry of Stem Cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Quantitative analysis reveals increased histone modifications and a
   broad nucleosome-free region bound by histone acetylases in highly
   expressed genes in human CD4(+) T cells
SO GENOMICS
AB Genome-wide mapping of nucleosomes and histone modifications revealed
   meaningful patterns. Despite advances in resolving the associations
   between chromatin and transcription, quantitative chromatin dynamics
   have not been well defined. We quantitatively determined differences in
   histone modifications, nucleosome positions, DNA methylation, and
   transcription factor binding in highly expressed and repressed genes in
   human CD4(+) T cells. We showed that the first (-1) nucleosome upstream
   of the transcription start site (TSS) is shifted to the 5' direction,
   thus forming a broad nucleosome-free region (NFR) near the TSS in highly
   expressed genes in CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, the transcription factor
   YY1 and histone acetyltransferases bind the NFR with high affinity. Most
   of histone acetylations drastically increase in transcription activation
   (>5 folds). We also suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) occur at a much lower frequency in highly expressed genes than in
   repressed genes. Our analysis quantitatively revealed details of
   chromatin dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Melanocortin-4 receptor in the medial amygdala regulates emotional
   stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour, anorexia and corticosterone
   secretion
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB The central melanocortin system has been implicated in emotional
   stress-induced anxiety, anorexia and activation of the
   hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the underlying neural
   substrates have not been identified. The medial amygdala (MeA) is highly
   sensitive to emotional stress and expresses high levels of the
   melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). This study investigated the effects of
   activation and blockade of MC4R in the MeA on anxiety-like behaviour,
   food intake and corticosterone secretion. We demonstrate that
   MC4R-expressing neurons in the MeA were activated by acute restraint
   stress, as indicated by induction of c-fos mRNA expression. Infusion of
   a selective MC4R agonist into the MeA elicited anxiogenic-like effects
   in the elevated plus-maze test and decreased food intake. In contrast,
   local MeA infusion of SHU 9119, a MC4R antagonist, blocked restraint
   stress-induced anxiogenic and anorectic effects. Moreover, plasma
   corticosterone levels were increased by intra-MeA infusion of the MC4R
   agonist under non-stressed conditions and restraint stress-induced
   elevation of plasma corticosterone levels was attenuated by pretreatment
   with SHU 9119 in the MeA. Thus, stimulating MC4R in the MeA induces
   stress-like anxiogenic and anorectic effects as well as activation of
   the HPA axis, whereas antagonizing MC4R in this region blocks such
   effects induced by restraint stress. Together, our results implicate
   MC4R signalling in the MeA in behavioural and endocrine responses to
   stress.

TI Metamorphoses of credit: pastiche production and the ordering of mass
   payment behaviour
SO ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
AB This paper discusses the problem of market changes and the interplay
   between innovation and imitation on the basis of an ethnographic case
   study of retail credit services. It presents a six-stage metamorphosing
   circle starting from conception and going on to formatting, promotion,
   adaptation, transmutation and, finally, internal supervision as part of
   an institutionally bounded mode of production based on copy/paste and
   updating procedures. Such a mode is called pastiche production' and it
   may be considered as a less innovative variant of bricolage, more suited
   to those players in advanced economies who mediate between global
   financial markets and national retail credit markets. From this
   empirical perspective, the conceptual separation between innovation and
   imitation is reconsidered, as the two notions seem to be deeply
   entangled in practice, in the sense that what appears like innovation at
   the national level may basically be an imitative propensity on an
   international or global scale. Moreover, the idea that innovation and
   imitation represent core principles of social organization (cf. Tarde)
   is also questioned in relation to modern finance, as they appear less
   like causes and more like consequences of institutional practices and
   governance procedures designed to organize mass payment behaviour
   capable of generating regular and substantial cash flows.

TI Bone response of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) induced by
   corticosterone
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Experiments were conducted with chickens exposed to corticosterone
   (CURT), with the aim of determining its effects on bone characteristics.
   At 7 d of age, the experimental birds were injected daily with CORT (4
   mg/kg of body mass) for 1 week. CURT administration significantly
   decreased the body weight while increasing relative liver weight of the
   chickens and the bone parameters were also decreased. Histology and
   immunohistochemistry of type X collagen revealed that CURT reduced the
   lengths of proliferative and prehypertrophic zone in growth plate and
   the number of positive chondrocytes in the prehypertrophic zone. In
   conclusion exposure to CURT depressed the growth performance and
   retarded the longitudinal growth of the long bones by inhibiting the
   proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in growth plate in
   broilers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Regulation of DNA Methylation in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synoviocytes
SO JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which
   fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) exhibit an aggressive phenotype.
   Although the mechanisms responsible are not well defined, epigenetic
   determinants such as DNA methylation might contribute. DNA
   methyltransferases (DNMTs) are critical enzymes that establish and
   maintain DNA methylation. We evaluated whether proinflammatory cytokines
   might contribute to differential DNA methylation previously described in
   RA FLS through altered DNMT expression. FLS were obtained from RA and
   osteoarthritis (OA) synovium at the time of total joint replacement.
   Gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and protein
   expression by Western blot analysis. DNMT activity was measured with a
   functional assay, and global methylation was determined by an
   immunoassay that detects methylcytosine. Resting expression of DNMT1,
   -3a, and -3b mRNA were similar in RA and OA FLS. Western blot showed
   abundant DNMT1 and DNMT3a protein. Exposure to IL-1 decreased DNMT1 and
   DNMT3a mRNA expression in FLS. Dose responses demonstrated decreased
   DNMT expression at concentrations as low as 1 pg/ml of IL-1. DNMT mRNA
   levels decreased rapidly, with significant suppression after 2-8 h of
   IL-1 stimulation. IL-1 stimulation of OA FLS did not affect methylation
   of LINE1 sites but led to demethylation of a CHI3L1 locus that is
   hypomethylated in RA FLS. Chronic IL-1 stimulation also mimicked the
   effect of a DNMT inhibitor on FLS gene expression. Exposure to
   proinflammatory mediators reversibly alters DNA methylation in FLS by
   decreasing DNMT expression and function. These data suggest that IL-1
   can potentially imprint cells in chronic inflammatory diseases. The

TI Haploinsufficiency of the paternal-effect gene Dnmt3L results in
   transient DNA hypomethylation in progenitor cells of the male germline
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB How does haploinsufficiency of the paternal-effect gene Dnmt3L affect
   DNA methylation establishment and stability in the male germline?
   Reduced expression of DNMT3L in male germ cells, associated with
   haploinsufficiency of the paternal-effect gene Dnmt3L, results in
   abnormal hypomethylation of prenatal germline progenitor cells.
   The DNA methyltransferase regulator Dnmt3-Like (Dnmt3L) is a
   paternal-effect gene required for DNA methylation acquisition in male
   germline stem cells and their precursors. In males, DNMT3L deficiency
   causes meiotic abnormalities and infertility. While Dnmt3L heterozygous
   males are fertile, they have abnormalities in X chromosome compaction
   and postmeiotic gene expression and sire offspring with sex chromosome
   aneuploidy. It has been proposed that the paternal effects of Dnmt3L
   haploinsufficiency are due to epigenetic defects in early male germ
   cells. DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic modification essential
   for normal germ cell development. Since patterns of DNA methylation
   across the genome are initially acquired in prenatal male germ cells,
   perturbations in methylation could contribute to the epigenetic basis of
   the paternal effects in Dnmt3L(/) males.
   This is a cross-sectional study of DNA methylation in Dnmt3L(/) versus
   Dnmt3L(/) male germ cells collected from mice at 16.5 days post-coitum
   (dpc), Day 6 and Day 70 (n 3 per genotype, each n represents a pool of
   220 animals). Additionally, DNA methylation was compared in enriched
   populations of spermatogonial stem cells (SSC)/progenitor cells from
   Dnmt3L(/) and Dnmt3L(/) males following approximate to 2 months in
   culture.
   DNA methylation at intergenic loci along chromosomes 9 and X was
   examined by quantitative analysis of DNA methylation by real-time
   polymerase chain reaction at the time of initial acquisition of
   epigenetic patterns in the prenatal male germline (16.5 dpc) and
   compared with patterns in early post-natal spermatogonia (Day 6) and in
   spermatozoa in mice. DNA methylation status at CpG-rich sites across the
   genome was assessed in spermatogonial precursors from Day 4 male mice
   using restriction landmark genomic scanning.
   At 16.5 dpc, 42 of intergenic loci examined along chromosome 9 and 10 of
   those along chromosome X were hypomethylated in Dnmt3L heterozygotes. By
   Day 6 and in spermatozoa, germ cell DNA methylation was similar in
   heterozygous and wild-type mice. DNA methylation stability of acquired
   patterns in wild-type and Dnmt3L(/) SSC/progenitor cell culture was
   analyzed at numerous loci across the genome in cells cultured in vitro
   and collected at passages 628. While the methylation of most loci was
   stable in culture over time, differences at approximate to 1 of sites
   were found between Dnmt3L(/) and Dnmt3L(/) cultures.
   Evaluation of DNA methylation in SSCs can only be performed after a
   period of culture limiting the investigation to changes observed during
   culture when compared with DNA methylation differences between genotypes
   that could be present at the beginning of culture establishment.
   The DNA methylation defects described here in prenatal male germline
   progenitor cells and SSC culture are the earliest epigenetic
   perturbations yet identified for a mammalian paternal-effect gene and
   may influence downstream epigenetic events in germ cells at later stages
   of development. Together, the results provide evidence of a owindow' of
   susceptibility in prenatal male germ cell precursors for the induction
   of epimutations due to genetic perturbations and, potentially, in utero
   environmental exposures.

TI L1 Gene Methylation in High-Risk Human Papillomaviruses for the
   Prognosis of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical
   significance of DNA methylation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome
   as a prognostic biomarker for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
   Methods and Materials: Clinical samples (paraffin-embedded tissues
   obtained by conization/hysterectomy or initial punch biopsy) were
   collected from patients at the Gynecologic Oncology of the Hyogo Cancer
   Center with informed consent. We evaluated the methylation status of the
   L1 gene of the HPV genome by bisulfite sequencing, calculating the
   methylation ratio (L1MR) as (number of methylated CpGs in the analyzed
   region of the L1 gene)/(number of all CpGs in the analyzed region of the
   L1 gene) x 100. The methylation analysis and in situ hybridization were
   performed with serial tissue-section slices.
   Results: DNA methylation was observed in the L1 gene, but not in the
   long control region of HPV-16, -18, or the other high-risk HPV types
   including HPV-31, -52, and -58. L1MR was associated with the CIN grade;
   the median L1MR was 2.3%, 11.2%, 35.2%, and 50.0% for CIN1, CIN2, CIN3,
   and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. L1MRs also seemed to indicate
   physical status (integrated or episomal form) of the HPV genome in the
   host cell. L1MR of the progression group was significantly higher than
   that of the regression group.
   Conclusions: L1MR was associated with the CIN grade and indicated the
   HPV genome status in the host cell: high L1MR indicated HPV genome
   integration linked to progression from early-stage CINs, whereas low
   L1MR indicated an episomal HPV genome location in host cells. L1MR may
   be a prognostic indicator of CIN.

TI Persistent effects of prior chronic exposure to corticosterone on
   reward-related learning and motivation in rodents
SO PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Repeated or prolonged exposure to stress has profound effects on a wide
   spectrum of behavioral and neurobiological processes and has been
   associated with the pathophysiology of depression. The multifaceted
   nature of this disorder includes despair, anhedonia, diminished
   motivation, and disrupted cognition, and it has been proposed that
   depression is also associated with reduced reward-motivated learning. We
   have previously reported that prior chronic corticosterone exposure to
   mice produces a lasting depressive-like state that can be reversed by
   chronic antidepressant treatment.
   In the present study, we tested the effects of prior chronic exposure to
   corticosterone (50 mu g/ml) administered to rats or to mice in drinking
   water for 14 days followed by dose-tapering over 9 days.
   The exposure to corticosterone produced lasting deficits in the
   acquisition of reward-related learning tested on a food-motivated
   instrumental task conducted 10-20 days after the last day of full dose
   corticosterone exposure. Rats exposed to corticosterone also displayed
   reduced responding on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement when
   tested on day 21 after exposure. Amitriptyline (200 mg/ml in drinking
   water) exposure for 14 days to mice produced the opposite effect,
   enhancing food-motivated instrumental acquisition and performance.
   Repeated treatment with amitriptyline (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally; bid)
   subsequent to corticosterone exposure also prevented the
   corticosterone-induced deficits in rats.
   These results are consistent with aberrant reward-related learning and
   motivational processes in depressive states and provide new evidence
   that stress-induced neuroadaptive alterations in cortico-limbic-striatal
   brain circuits involved in learning and motivation may play a critical
   role in aspects of mood disorders.

TI Specificity Protein 1 (Sp1)-dependent Activation of the Synapsin I Gene
   (SYN1) Is Modulated by RE1-silencing Transcription Factor (REST) and 5
   '-Cytosine-Phosphoguanine (CpG) Methylation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The development and function of the nervous system are directly
   dependent on a well defined pattern of gene expression. Indeed,
   perturbation of transcriptional activity or epigenetic modifications of
   chromatin can dramatically influence neuronal phenotypes. The
   phosphoprotein synapsin I (Syn I) plays a crucial role during
   axonogenesis and synaptogenesis as well as in synaptic transmission and
   plasticity of mature neurons. Abnormalities in SYN1 gene expression have
   been linked to important neuropsychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy
   and autism. SYN1 gene transcription is suppressed in non-neural tissues
   by the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST); however, the molecular
   mechanisms that allow the constitutive expression of this genetic region
   in neurons have not been clarified yet. Herein we demonstrate that a
   conserved region of human and mouse SYN1 promoters contains cis-sites
   for the transcriptional activator Sp1 in close proximity to REST binding
   motifs. Through a series of functional assays, we demonstrate a physical
   interaction of Sp1 on the SYN1 promoter and show that REST directly
   inhibits Sp1-mediated transcription, resulting in SYN1 down-regulation.
   Upon differentiation of neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells, we observe a
   decrease in endogenous REST and a higher stability of Sp1 on target GC
   boxes, resulting in an increase of SYN1 transcription. Moreover,
   methylation of Sp1 cis-sites in the SYN1 promoter region could provide
   an additional level of transcriptional regulation. Our results introduce
   Sp1 as a fundamental activator of basal SYN1 gene expression, whose
   activity is modulated by the neural master regulator REST and CpG
   methylation.

TI Influence of chromatin structure, antibiotics, and endogenous histone
   methylation on phosphorylation of histones H1 and H3 in the presence of
   protein kinase A in rat liver nuclei in vitro
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB In vitro phosphorylation of histones H1 and H3 by cAMP-dependent protein
   kinase A and endogenous phosphokinases in the presence of
   [gamma-(32)P]ATP was studied in isolated rat liver nuclei with different
   variants of chromatin structural organization: condensed (diameter of
   fibrils 100-200 nm; N-1) and partly decondensed (diameter of fibrils
   similar to 30 nm; N-2). In the N-1 state histone, H1 is phosphorylated
   approximately twice as much than histone H3. Upon the decondensation of
   the chromatin in the N-2 state, 1.5-fold decrease of total
   phosphorylation of H1 is observed, while that of H3 does not change,
   although the endogenous phosphorylation of both histones is reduced by
   half. Changes in histone phosphorylation in the presence of low or high
   concentrations of distamycin and chromomycin differ for H1 and H3 in N-1
   and N-2. It was found that distamycin (DM) stimulates the
   phosphorylation of tightly bound H1 fraction, which is not extractable
   by polyglutamic acid (PG), especially in N-1. Chromomycin (CM) increases
   the phosphorylation of both histones in PG extracts and in the nuclear
   pellets, particularly in N-2. At the same time, in N-1 one can detect
   phosphorylation of a tightly bound fraction of histones H1 whose
   N-termini are located on AT-rich sites that become inaccessible for
   protein kinase in the process of chromatin decondensation in N-2. At the
   same time, in N-2 the accessibility for protein kinase A of tightly
   bound H1 fractions, whose N-termini are located on GC-rich sites,
   increases dramatically. High concentrations of both CM and DM in N-1 and
   N-2 stimulated phosphorylation of the non-extractable by PG fraction of
   H1 whose N-termini are located on sites where AT a parts per thousand
   GC. CM at high concentration stimulated 4-7 times the phosphorylation of
   a small fraction of H3, which is extracted by PG from both types of
   nuclei. We detected an effect of endogenous methylation of histones H1
   and H3 in the nuclei on their subsequent phosphorylation depending on
   the chromatin structure, histone-chromatin binding strength, and
   concentration of DM.

TI Transcriptional repressors: multifaceted regulators of gene expression
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Through decades of research it has been established that some
   chromatin-modifying proteins can repress transcription, and thus are
   generally termed 'repressors'. Although classic repressors undoubtedly
   silence transcription, genome-wide studies have shown that many
   repressors are associated with actively transcribed loci and that this
   is a widespread phenomenon. Here, we review the evidence for the
   presence of repressors at actively transcribed regions and assess what
   roles they might be playing. We propose that the modulation of
   expression levels by chromatin-modifying, co-repressor complexes
   provides transcriptional fine-tuning that drives development.

TI De novo DNA methylation of endogenous retroviruses is shaped by
   KRAB-ZFPs/KAP1 and ESET
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) undergo de novo DNA methylation during
   the first few days of mammalian embryogenesis, although the factors that
   control the targeting of this process are largely unknown. We asked
   whether KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) is involved in this mechanism
   because of its previously defined role in maintaining the silencing of
   ERVs through the histone methyltransferase ESET and histone H3 lysine 9
   trimethylation. Here, we demonstrate that introduced ERV sequences are
   sufficient to direct rapid de novo methylation of a flanked promoter in
   embryonic stem (ES) cells. This mechanism requires the presence of an
   ERV sequence-recognizing KRAB zinc-finger protein (ZFP) and both KAP1
   and ESET. Furthermore, this process can also take place on a strong
   cellular promoter and leads to methylation signatures that are
   subsequently maintained in vivo throughout embryogenesis. Finally, we
   show that methylation of ERVs residing in the genome is affected by
   knockout of KAP1 in early embryos. KRAB-ZFPs, KAP1 and ESET are thus
   likely to be responsible for the early embryonic instatement of stable
   epigenetic marks at ERV-containing loci.

TI EMdeCODE: a novel algorithm capable of reading words of epigenetic code
   to predict enhancers and retroviral integration sites and to identify
   H3R2me1 as a distinctive mark of coding versus non-coding genes
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Existence of some extra-genetic (epigenetic) codes has been postulated
   since the discovery of the primary genetic code. Evident effects of
   histone post-translational modifications or DNA methylation over the
   efficiency and the regulation of DNA processes are supporting this
   postulation. EMdeCODE is an original algorithm that approximate the
   genomic distribution of given DNA features (e. g. promoter, enhancer,
   viral integration) by identifying relevant ChIPSeq profiles of
   post-translational histone marks or DNA binding proteins and combining
   them in a supermark. EMdeCODE kernel is essentially a two-step
   procedure: (i) an expectation maximization process calculates the
   mixture of epigenetic factors that maximize the Sensitivity (recall) of
   the association with the feature under study; (ii) the approximated
   density is then recursively trimmed with respect to a control dataset to
   increase the precision by reducing the number of false positives.
   EMdeCODE densities improve significantly the prediction of enhancer loci
   and retroviral integration sites with respect to previous methods.
   Importantly, it can also be used to extract distinctive factors between
   two arbitrary conditions. Indeed EMdeCODE identifies unexpected
   epigenetic profiles specific for coding versus non-coding RNA, pointing
   towards a new role for H3R2me1 in coding regions.

TI Ing1 functions in DNA demethylation by directing Gadd45a to H3K4me3
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB Active DNA demethylation regulates epigenetic gene activation in
   numerous processes, but how the target site specificity of DNA
   demethylation is determined and what factors are involved are still
   poorly understood. Here we show that the tumor suppressor inhibitor of
   growth protein 1 (Ing1) is required for targeting active DNA
   demethylation. Ing1 functions by recruiting the regulator of DNA
   demethylation growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45a (Gadd45a) to
   histone H3 trimethylated at Lys 4 (H3K4me3). We show that reduced H3K4
   methylation impairs recruitment of Gadd45a/Ing1 and gene-specific DNA
   demethylation. Our results indicate that histone methylation directs DNA
   demethylation.

   However, the detailed mechanisms by which retroviral silencing is
   initiated and maintained are not well understood. Using a model system
   in which avian sarcoma virus (ASV) DNA is epigenetically repressed in
   mammalian cells, we previously found that a cellular scaffolding
   protein, Daxx, acts as an antiretroviral factor that promotes epigenetic
   repression through recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here we
   show that human Daxx protein levels are increased in response to
   retroviral infection and that Daxx acts at the time of infection to
   initiate epigenetic repression. Consistent with a rapid and active
   antiviral epigenetic response, we found that repressive histone marks
   and long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA methylation could be detected within
   12 h to 3 days postinfection, respectively. Daxx was also found to be
   required for long-term ASV silencing maintenance and full viral DNA
   methylation, and it was physically associated with both viral DNA and
   DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). These findings support a model in which
   incoming retroviral protein-DNA complexes are detected by Daxx, and the
   integrated provirus is rapidly chromatinized and repressed by DNA
   methylation and histone modification as part of an antiviral response.
   These results uncover a possible direct and active antiviral mechanism
   by which DNMTs can be recruited to retroviral DNA.

TI Analysis of the DNA methylation of maize (Zea mays L.) in response to
   cold stress based on methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphisms
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY
AB DNA methylation plays a vital role in tuning gene expression in response
   to environmental stimuli. Here, methylation-sensitive amplified
   polymorphisms (MSAP) were used to assess the effect of cold stress on
   the extent and patterns of DNA methylation in maize seedlings. Overall,
   cold-induced genome-wide DNA methylation polymorphisms accounted for
   32.6 to 34.8% of the total bands at the different treatment time-points.
   It was demonstrated that the extent and pattern of DNA methylation was
   induced by cold stress through the cold treatment process and that the
   demethylation of fully methylated fragments was the main contributor of
   the DNA methylation alterations. The sequences of 28 differentially
   amplified fragments relevant to stress were successfully obtained. Under
   the cold stress, demethylation was detected in most fragments. BLAST
   results indicate that the homologues of these fragments are involved in
   many processes, including hormone regulation, cold response,
   photosynthesis, and transposon activation. The expression analysis
   demonstrated an increase in the transcription of five demethylated
   genes. Despite the fact that DNA methylation changes and cold
   acclimation are not directly associated, our results may indicate that
   the specific demethylation of genes is an active and rapid epigenetic
   response to cold in maize during the seedling stage, further elucidating
   the mechanism of maize adaptation to cold stress.

TI Genomewide analysis indicates that queen larvae have lower methylation
   levels in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)
SO NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN
AB The honey bee is a social insect characterized by caste differentiation,
   by which a young larva can develop into either a queen or a worker.
   Despite possessing the same genome, queen and workers display marked
   differences in reproductive capacity, physiology, and behavior. Recent
   studies have shown that DNA methylation plays important roles in caste
   differentiation. To further explore the roles of DNA methylation in this
   process, we analyzed DNA methylome profiles of both queen larvae (QL)
   and worker larvae (WL) of different ages (2, 4, and 6 day old), by using
   methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (meDIP-seq) technique. The
   global DNA methylation levels varied between the larvae of two castes.
   DNA methylation increased from 2-day- to 4-day-old QL and then decreased
   in 6-day-old larvae. In WL, methylation levels increased with age. The
   methylcytosines in both larvae were enriched in introns, followed by
   coding sequence (CDS) regions, CpG islands, 2 kbp downstream and
   upstream of genes, and 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The number
   of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in 2-, 4-, and 6-day-old QL
   and WL was 725, 3,013, and 5,049, respectively. Compared to 4- and
   6-day-old WL, a large number of genes in QL were downmethylated, which
   were involved in many processes including development, reproduction, and
   metabolic regulation. In addition, some DMGs were concerned with caste
   differentiation.

TI Label-free methylation specific sensor based on silicon microring
   resonators for detection and quantification of DNA methylation
   biomarkers in bladder cancer
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Detection and quantification of DNA methylation is important to provide
   an opportunity to resolve clinical issues such as cancer early
   detection, progression, and drug treatments. In spite of myriad current
   technologies for DNA methylation detection that have been developed in
   last decade, they are still complicated and inadequate to be used as in
   vitro clinical diagnostic device. This work presents the first
   methylation specific sensor based on the silicon microring resonators
   which achieves fast, simple and specific label-free detection of DNA
   methylation after the bisulfite conversion. The methylated promoter
   regions of three genes (DAPK, E-cadherin and RAR beta), which have been
   widely studied as biomarkers for human cancers including bladder cancer,
   are used as the target DNA sequences. We show that the methylated
   targets are strongly captured by methylated probe compared to
   unmethylated probe or vice versa. The discrimination between methylated
   and unmethylated DNA sequences is achieved within 5 min after
   hybridization between target and probe. Additionally, we have quantified
   DNA methylation density using various proportions (100, 75, 50, 25, and
   0% of methylation sites) of methylation sequences of DAPK gene. Finally,
   we confirmed that the sensor can clearly detect the methylation of RAR
   beta gene by using amplified target from genomic DNA of cancer cells.
   Therefore, our technique can be used to detect and quantify the
   methylation density in cancer biomarkers. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

TI DNA methylation at promoter regions of interleukin 1B, interleukin 6,
   and interleukin 8 in non-small cell lung cancer
SO CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
AB Epidemiologic and experimental evidences support the concept that
   inflammation promotes the development and progression of cancers.
   Interleukins (ILs) regulate the expression of several molecules and
   signaling pathways involved in inflammation. High expression of some ILs
   in the tumor microenvironment has been associated with a more virulent
   tumor phenotype. To examine the role of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in
   non-small cell lung cancer, we measured mRNA levels and promoter DNA
   methylation in a panel of cultured human lung cells (n = 23) and in
   matched pair lung tumor versus adjacent non-tumorous tissues (n = 24).
   We found that lung cancer cells or tissues had significantly different
   DNA methylation and mRNA levels than normal human bronchial epithelial
   cells or adjacent non-tumorous tissues, respectively. High DNA
   methylation of ILs promoters in lung cancer cells or tissues was
   associated with low mRNA levels. We found an inverse correlation between
   DNA methylation of IL1B, IL6, and IL8 gene promoters and their
   corresponding mRNA levels, such inverse correlation was more significant
   for IL1B (i.e., all cancer cell lines used in this study had a
   hypermethylated IL1B promoter which was associated with silencing of the
   gene). Our results underline for the first time the role of epigenetic
   modifications in the regulation of the expression of key cytokines
   involved in the inflammatory response during lung cancer development.

TI Chromatin marks identify critical cell types for fine mapping complex
   trait variants
SO NATURE GENETICS
AB If trait-associated variants alter regulatory regions, then they should
   fall within chromatin marks in relevant cell types. However, it is
   unclear which of the many marks are most useful in defining cell types
   associated with disease and fine mapping variants. We hypothesized that
   informative marks are phenotypically cell type specific; that is, SNPs
   associated with the same trait likely overlap marks in the same cell
   type. We examined 15 chromatin marks and found that those highlighting
   active gene regulation were phenotypically cell type specific.
   Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) was the most
   phenotypically cell type specific (P < 1 x 10(-6)), driven by
   colocalization of variants and marks rather than gene proximity (P <
   0.001). H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with 37 SNPs for plasma low-density
   lipoprotein concentration in the liver (P < 7 x 10(-5)), 31 SNPs for
   rheumatoid arthritis within CD4(+) regulatory T cells (P = 1 x 10(-4)),
   67 SNPs for type 2 diabetes in pancreatic islet cells (P = 0.003) and
   the liver (P = 0.003), and 14 SNPs for neuropsychiatric disease in
   neuronal tissues (P = 0.007). We show how cell type-specific H3K4me3
   peaks can inform the fine mapping of associated SNPs to identify causal
   variation.

TI Chromatin proteins captured by ChIP-mass spectrometry are linked to
   dosage compensation in Drosophila
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB X-chromosome dosage compensation by the MSL (male-specific lethal)
   complex is required in Drosophila melanogaster to increase gene
   expression from the single male X to equal that of both female X
   chromosomes. Instead of focusing solely on protein complexes released
   from DNA, here we used chromatin-interacting protein MS (ChIP-MS) to
   identify MSL interactions on cross-linked chromatin. We identified
   MSL-enriched histone modifications, including histone H4 Lys16
   acetylation and histone H3 Lys36 methylation, and CG4747, a putative
   Lys36-trimethylated histone H3 (H3K36me3)-binding protein. CG4747 is
   associated with the bodies of active genes, coincident with H3K36me3,
   and is mislocalized in the Set2 mutant lacking H3K36me3. CG4747 loss of
   function in vivo results in partial mislocalization of the MSL complex
   to autosomes, and RNA interference experiments confirm that CG4747 and
   Set2 function together to facilitate targeting of the MSL complex to
   active genes, validating the ChIP-MS approach.

TI Stress induced hippocampal mineralocorticoid and estrogen receptor beta
   gene expression and long-term potentiation in male adult rats is
   sensitive to early-life stress experience
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoid hormones and their receptors have been identified to be
   involved in emotional and cognitive disorders in early stressed subjects
   during adulthood. However, the impact of other steroid hormones and
   receptors has been considered less. Especially, functional roles of
   estrogen and estrogen receptors in male subjects are largely unknown.
   Therefore, we measured hippocampal concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol,
   corticosterone and testosterone, as well as the gene expression of
   estrogen receptor alpha and beta (ER alpha, beta), androgen receptor
   (AR), glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors after
   stress in adulthood in maternally separated (MS+; at postnatal days
   14-16 for 6 h each day) and control (MS-) male rats. In vivo hippocampal
   long-term potentiation (LTP) serves as a cellular model of learning and
   memory formation. Population spike- (PSA) and the fEPSP-LTP within the
   dentate gyrus (DG) were reinforced by elevated-platformstress
   (EP-stress) in MS- but not in MS+ rats. MR- and ER beta-mRNA were
   upregulated 1 h after EP-stress in MS- but not in MS+ rats as compared
   to non-stressed littermates. Infusion of an MR antagonist before LIP
   induction blocked early- and late-PSA- and -fEPSP-LTP, whereas blockade
   of ER B impaired only the late PSA-LTP. Application of a DNA
   nnethyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor partly restored the
   LTP-reinforcement in MS+ rats, accompanied by a retrieval of ER beta-
   but not MR-mRNA upregulation. Basal ER beta gene promoter methylation
   was similar between groups, whereas MS+ and MS rats showed different
   methylation patterns across CpG sites after EP-stress. These findings
   indicate a key role of ER beta in early-stress mediated emotionality and
   emotion-induced late-LIP in adult male rats via DNA rnethylation
   mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Arabidopsis Elongator Complex Subunit2 Epigenetically Regulates
   Plant Immune Responses
SO PLANT CELL
AB The Arabidopsis thaliana Elongator complex subunit2 (ELP2) genetically
   interacts with NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (NPR1), a key
   transcription coactivator of plant immunity, and regulates the induction
   kinetics of defense genes. However, the mechanistic relationship between
   ELP2 and NPR1 and how ELP2 regulates the kinetics of defense gene
   induction are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ELP2 is an epigenetic
   regulator required for pathogen-induced rapid transcriptome
   reprogramming. We show that ELP2 functions in a transcriptional
   feed-forward loop regulating both NPR1 and its target genes. An elp2
   mutation increases the total methylcytosine number, reduces the average
   methylation levels of methylcytosines, and alters (increases or
   decreases) methylation levels of specific methylcytosines.
   Interestingly, infection of plants with the avirulent bacterial pathogen
   Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000/avrRpt2 induces biphasic changes
   in DNA methylation levels of NPR1 and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4),
   which encodes another key regulator of plant immunity. These dynamic
   changes are blocked by the elp2 mutation, which is correlated with
   delayed induction of NPR1 and PAD4. The elp2 mutation also reduces basal
   histone acetylation levels in the coding regions of several defense
   genes. Together, our data demonstrate a new role for Elongator in
   somatic DNA demethylation/methylation and suggest a function for
   Elongator-mediated chromatin regulation in pathogen-induced
   transcriptome reprogramming.

TI Chromatin remodeling - a novel strategy to control excessive alcohol
   drinking
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Harmful excessive use of alcohol has a severe impact on society and it
   remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the
   population. However, mechanisms that underlie excessive alcohol
   consumption are still poorly understood, and thus available medications
   for alcohol use disorders are limited. Here, we report that changing the
   level of chromatin condensation by affecting DNA methylation or histone
   acetylation limits excessive alcohol drinking and seeking behaviors in
   rodents. Specifically, we show that decreasing DNA methylation by
   inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) with systemic
   administration of the FDA-approved drug, 5-azacitidine (5-AzaC) prevents
   excessive alcohol use in mice. Similarly, we find that increasing
   histone acetylation via systemic treatment with several histone
   deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reduces mice binge-like alcohol drinking.
   We further report that systemic administration of the FDA-approved HDAC
   inhibitor, SAHA, inhibits the motivation of rats to seek alcohol.
   Importantly, the actions of both DNMT and HDAC inhibitors are specific
   for alcohol, as no changes in saccharin or sucrose intake were observed.
   In line with these behavioral findings, we demonstrate that excessive
   alcohol drinking increases DNMT1 levels and reduces histone H4
   acetylation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rodents. Together, our
   findings illustrate that DNA methylation and histone acetylation control
   the level of excessive alcohol drinking and seeking behaviors in
   preclinical rodent models. Our study therefore highlights the
   possibility that DNMT and HDAC inhibitors can be used to treat harmful
   alcohol abuse. Translational Psychiatry (2013) 3, e231;

TI Exposure to variable prenatal stress in rats: Effects on anxiety-related
   behaviors, innate and contextual fear, and fear extinction
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Rats repeatedly exposed to variable prenatal stress (PNS) exhibit
   behavioral features often observed in neuropsychiatric disorders
   including elevated sensitivity to stimulants and impairments of
   attention, inhibitory control and memory-related task performance.
   However, to date there have been relatively few studies designed to
   assess the effects of PNS on anxiety, stress and fear responses, or the
   function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a system
   clearly linked to stress and fear-related responses as well as
   neuropsychiatric disorders). In the current study, rats exposed to
   variable PNS were evaluated for anxiety-related behaviors in open field,
   elevated plus maze, and light/dark preference tasks. Innate fear
   responses were assessed using a predatory odor task and learned fear and
   extinction were assessed with a contextual fear conditioning task. As an
   indicator of HPA axis function, serum corticosterone levels were
   determined by enzyme immunoassay at various time points. The results
   indicated that PNS resulted in several behavioral anomalies including
   decreased innate fear responses to predator odor, impaired fear
   extinction, increased locomotor activity and stereotypic-like behaviors.
   Baseline levels of corticosterone in PNS subjects were similar to
   non-stressed controls; however, when exposed to acute stress, they
   exhibited an increase in corticosterone that was greater in magnitude.
   PNS was not associated with increased anxiety-like behaviors or deficits
   in learning or retention during contextual fear conditioning.
   Collectivity, these data support the argument that variable PNS in rats
   is a valid model system for studying some behavioral components of
   neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the influence of stress hormones.

TI Oocyte extract improves epigenetic reprogramming of yak fibroblast cells
   and cloned embryo development
SO THERIOGENOLOGY
AB The objective was to investigate the effects of bovine oocyte extract
   (BOE) on epigenetic reprogramming of yak fibroblast cells, based on
   their cell cycle status, histone acetylation, DNA methylation, gene
   expression, and cloned blastocyst formation. Permeabilization of yak
   fibroblasts after treatment with 10 or 50 mu L of BOE (treated-S and
   treated-L groups, respectively) for 24 hours increased (P < 0.05) the
   cell population at the G(0)/G(1) phase (85.2 +/- 2.3% and 89.6 +/- 1.5%,
   respectively) compared with controls (75.4 +/- 1.1%). Acetylation at
   lysine 9 of histone H3 was also higher (26.1 +/- 1.4 and 33.5 +/- 2.1)
   than in the control group (15.3 +/- 1.6; P < 0.05). Moreover, BOE
   reduced methylation of the promoter regions of Oct-4 and Nanog (76.4%
   and 72.2%; and 35.6% and 30.0%, respectively) compared with the control
   group (92.1% and 47.8%; P < 0.05). In addition, the relative expression
   levels of HDAC-1, HADC-2, Dnmt-1, and Dnmt-3a were downregulated (P <
   0.05) after yak fibroblasts were treated with BOE. Furthermore, when yak
   fibroblasts were used for interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer
   after BOE treatment, 8-cell and blastocyst formation rates significantly
   exceeded those of the control. In conclusion, BOE induced epigenetic
   reprogramming of yak fibroblasts, making them suitable donors for yak
   interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer. Crown Copyright (c) 2013

TI Short-term corticosterone treatment decreases the early CD8(+) T cell
   response to simian virus 40 tumor antigen but has no impact on the late
   CD8(+) T cell response
SO BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB CD8(+) T cells (T(CD8)) help control tumor growth in vivo through
   recognition of distinct tumor antigens and cytolysis of tumor cells. The
   T(CD8) immune response in C57BL/6 mice to the Simian Virus 40
   oncoprotein, large tumor antigen (Tag), targets multiple epitopes and is
   well-characterized. Epitope IV, an H-2K(b)-restricted epitope, is
   immunodominant while epitope I, an H-2D(b)-restricted epitope is
   subdominant. GCs alter many aspects of T cell function. Indeed, the
   current studies demonstrate that exposure of mice to the
   immunosuppressive GC, corticosterone (CURT), over the entire course of
   the primary immune response limits activation of endogenous Tag-specific
   T(CD8). Even short-term CURT treatment from day -1 to day +2
   post-immunization significantly reduced splenic size and the absolute
   number of Tag-specific T(CD8) on day 6 post-immunization. In vivo
   killing activity was also reduced. However, by day 10 post-immunization,
   the peak of the immune response, the absolute number of Tag-specific
   T(CD8) and their in vivo killing of epitope I or epitope IV-expressing
   target cells had recovered in CORT treated mice. Adoptive transfer of
   transgenic T cells post-CURT removal demonstrated that COAT decreased
   the ability of the endogenous antigen-presenting cells to induce
   proliferation of the exogenous transgenic T cells. Combined, these
   studies have implications about the timing of clinical steroid treatment
   relative to immunization or adoptive transfer for cancer immunotherapy.

   decreased expression of the stimulatory G protein alpha (Gs alpha) in
   specific tissues.
   Objective: To clarify the usefulness of methylation-specific multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA), we evaluated genetic
   and epigenetic changes of the GNAS locus in Japanese PHP-Ib patients.
   Design: Retrospective case series.
   Patients: We studied 13 subjects with PHP-Ib (three families with eight
   affected members and one unaffected member and four sporadic cases).
   Measurements: The methylation status of GNAS differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs) was evaluated using MS-MLPA. The main outcome measure was
   the presence of deletion mutations in the GNAS locus and STX16, which
   were assessed using MLPA.
   Results: In all familial PHP-Ib cases, a similar to 3 kb deletion of
   STX16 and demethylation of the A/B domain were identified. In contrast,
   no deletion was detected throughout the entire GNAS locus region in the
   sporadic cases. Broad methylation abnormalities were observed in the
   GNAS DMRs.
   Conclusions: MS-MLPA allows for precise and rapid analysis of the
   methylation status in GNAS DMRs as well as the detection of
   microdeletion mutations in PHP-Ib. Results confirm the previous findings
   in this disorder and demonstrate that this method is valuable for the
   genetic evaluation and visualizing the methylation status. The MS-MLPA
   assay is a useful tool that may facilitate making the molecular
   diagnosis of PHP-Ib. European Journal of Endocrinology 168 169-175

TI Targeted Genome-Wide Methylation and Gene Expression Analyses Reveal
   Signaling Pathways Involved in Ovarian Dysfunction after Developmental
   EDC Exposure in Rats
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB Transient exposure to methoxychlor (MXC), an environmental
   endocrine-disrupting chemical, during fetal and neonatal stages causes
   ovarian dysfunction in pubertal, adult, and aging animals. Adult animals
   have reduced number of ovulations and abnormal follicular composition
   associated with altered gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. To
   test the hypothesis that the ovarian epigenomic changes induced by MXC
   are detectable following the exposure period, leading to altered gene
   expression by adulthood, we conducted a targeted genome-wide methylation
   study using Nimblegen 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays.
   Control (vehicle), low-dose MXC (20 mu g/kg/day), or high-dose MXC (100
   mg/kg/day) treatments were administered between Embryonic Day 19 and
   Postnatal Day (PND) 7. Ovaries were collected at PND 7 immediately after
   exposure or at adulthood, PND 60. Array hybridizations were conducted
   with genomic DNA after methylated DNA immuno-precipitation and the array
   data were analyzed. DNA methylation events were functionally annotated,
   and candidate loci common to all the treatments or unique to some
   treatments were identified. Specific loci encoding signaling molecules
   such as the regulatory subunit p85 of phosphoinositide-3-kinase,
   insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, Harvey rat sarcoma viral
   oncogene, insulin receptor, and forkhead box protein O3 were identified
   to be hypermethylated in MXC-treated ovaries at PND 7 and/or PND 60.
   Examination of gene expression changes with TaqMan low-density arrays
   revealed that nearly 25% of the genes that were assayed were
   downregulated. These data demonstrate that key molecules in specific
   signaling pathways such as PTEN signaling, IGF-1 signaling, or rapid
   estrogen signaling are epigenetically altered in MXC-exposed ovaries,
   which is associated with ovarian dysfunction and female infertility.

TI Rapid Elevation of Calcium Concentration in Cultured Dorsal Spinal Cord
   Astrocytes by Corticosterone
SO NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB In addition to the classic genomic effects, increasing evidence suggests
   that GC can generate multiple rapid effects on many tissues and cells
   through nongenomic pathway. In the present study, the effects of
   corticosterone (CORT) on the intracellular calcium concentration
   ([Ca(2+)]i) in cultured dorsal spinal cord astrocytes were detected with
   confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluo-4/AM as a calcium
   fluorescent indicator that could monitor real-time alterations of
   [Ca(2+)]i. CORT (0.01-10 mu M) caused a rapid increase in [Ca(2+)]i with
   a dose-dependent manner in cultured dorsal spinal cord astrocytes. The
   action of CORT on astrocytic [Ca(2+)]i was blocked by pertussis toxin (a
   blocker of G protein activation, 100 ng/ml), but was unaffected by
   RU38486 (glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, 10 mu M). In addition,
   cycloheximide (protein-synthesis inhibitor, 10 mu g/ml) pretreatment
   could not impair the CORT-evoked [Ca(2+)]i elevation. Furthermore,
   Ca(2+) mobilization induced by CORT was abolished by chelerythrine
   chloride (protein kinase C inhibitor, 10 mu M), but was not impaired by
   H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor, 10 mu M). These observations suggest
   that a nongenomic pathways might be involved in the effect of CORT on
   [Ca(2+)]i in cultured dorsal spinal cord astrocytes. In addition, our
   results also raise a possibility that a putative pertussis
   toxin-sensitive mGCR (G-protein-coupled membrane-bound glucocorticoid
   receptor) and the downstream activation of protein kinase C may be
   responsible for CORT-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in cultured dorsal
   spinal cord astrocytes.

TI Locus-Specific DNA Methylation Reprogramming During Early Porcine
   Embryogenesis
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB During early mammalian embryogenesis, there is a wave of DNA
   demethylation postfertilization and de novo methylation around
   implantation. The paternal genome undergoes active DNA demethylation,
   whereas the maternal genome is passively demethylated after
   fertilization in most mammals except for sheep and rabbits. However, the
   emerging genome-wide DNA methylation landscape has revealed a regulatory
   and locus-specific DNA methylation reprogramming pattern in mammalian
   preimplantation embryos. Here we optimized a bisulfite sequencing
   protocol to draw base-resolution DNA methylation profiles of several
   selected genes in gametes, early embryos, and somatic tissue. We
   observed locus-specific DNA methylation reprogramming in early porcine
   embryos. First, some pluripotency genes (POU5F1 and NANOG) followed a
   typical wave of DNA demethylation and remethylation, whereas CpG-rich
   regions of SOX2 and CDX2 loci were hypomethylated throughout
   development. Second, a differentially methylated region of an imprint
   control region in the IGF2/H19 locus exhibited differential DNA
   methylation which was maintained in porcine early embryos. Third, a
   centromeric repeat element retained a moderate DNA methylation level in
   gametes, early embryos, and somatic tissue. The diverse DNA methylation
   reprogramming during early embryogenesis is thought to be possibly
   associated with the multiple functions of DNA methylation in
   transcriptional regulation, genome stability and genomic imprinting. The
   latest technology such as oxidative bisulfite sequencing to identify
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine will further clarify the DNA methylation
   reprogramming during porcine embryonic development.

TI Corticosterone mediates stress-related increased intestinal permeability
   in a region-specific manner
SO NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY
AB Background Chronic psychological stress (CPS) is associated with
   increased intestinal epithelial permeability and visceral hyperalgesia.
   It is unknown whether corticosterone (CORT) plays a role in mediating
   alterations of epithelial permeability in response to CPS. Methods Male
   rats were subjected to 1-h water avoidance (WA) stress or subcutaneous
   CORT injection daily for 10 consecutive days in the presence or absence
   of corticoid receptor antagonist RU-486. The visceromotor response (VMR)
   to colorectal distension (CRD) was measured. The in situ single-pass
   intestinal perfusion was used to measure intestinal permeability in
   jejunum and colon simultaneously. Key Results We observed significant
   decreases in the levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and tight
   junction proteins in the colon, but not the jejunum in stressed rats.
   These changes were largely reproduced by serial CORT injections in
   control rats and were significantly reversed by RU-486. Stressed and
   CORT-injected rats demonstrated a threefold increase in permeability for
   PEG-400 (MW) in colon, but not jejunum and significant increase in VMR
   to CRD, which was significantly reversed by RU-486. In addition, no
   differences in permeability to PEG-4000 and PEG-35 000 were detected
   between control and WA groups. Conclusions & Inferences Our findings
   indicate that CPS was associated with region-specific decrease in
   epithelial tight junction protein levels in the colon, increased colon
   epithelial permeability to low molecular weight macromolecules which
   were largely reproduced by CORT treatment in control rats and prevented
   by RU-486. These observations implicate a novel, region-specific role
   for CORT as a mediator of CPS-induced increased permeability to
   macromolecules across the colon epithelium.

TI Withania somnifera root extract ameliorates hypobaric hypoxia induced
   memory impairment in rats
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Withania somnifera (WS) root extract has
   been used traditionally in ayurvedic system of medicine as a memory
   enhancer and anti-stress agent.
   Aim of the study: To evaluate the neuroprotective and prophylactic
   potential of WS root extract in ameliorating hypobaric hypoxia (HH)
   induced memory impairment and to explore the underlying molecular
   mechanism.
   Materials and methods: WS root extract was administered to male Sprague
   Dawley rats during a period of 21 days pre-exposure and 07 days exposure
   to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Spatial memory was assessed by
   Morris Water Maze. Neurodegeneration, corticosterone, acetylcholine
   (Ach) levels, acetylcholine esterase (AchE) activity, oxidative stress
   markers and nitric oxide (NO) concentration were assessed in the
   hippocampus. Synaptic and apoptotic markers were also investigated by
   immunoblotting. To study the role of NO in regulating corticosterone
   mediated signaling, the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS)
   inhibitor, L-Nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-Name) and NO agonist sodium
   nitroprusside (SNP) were administered from 3rd to 7th day of hypoxic
   exposure.
   Results: Administration of WS root extract prevented HH induced memory
   impairment and neurodegeneration along with decreased NO,
   corticosterone, oxidative stress and AchE activity in hippocampal
   region. Inhibition of NO synthesis by administration of L-Name reduced
   corticosterone levels in hippocampus during hypoxic exposure while
   co-administration of corticosterone increased neurodegeneration.
   Administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) along with WS root extract
   supplementation during hypoxic exposure increased corticosterone levels
   and increased the number of pyknotic cells.
   Conclusion: WS root extract ameliorated HH induced memory impairment and
   neurodegeneration in hippocampus through NO mediated modulation of
   corticosterone levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

TI Gene body methylation is conserved between plant orthologs and is of
   evolutionary consequence
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB DNA methylation is a common feature of eukaryotic genomes and is
   especially common in noncoding regions of plants. Protein coding regions
   of plants are often methylated also, but the extent, function, and
   evolutionary consequences,of gene body methylation remain unclear. Here
   we investigate gene body methylation using an explicit comparative
   evolutionary approach. We generated bisulfite sequencing data from two
   tissues of Brachypodium distachyon and compared genic methylation
   patterns to those of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). Gene body
   methylation was strongly conserved between orthologs of the two species
   and affected a biased subset of long, slowly evolving genes. Because
   gene body methylation is conserved over evolutionary time, it shapes
   important features of plant genome evolution, such as the bimodality of
   G+C content among grass genes. Our results superficially contradict
   previous observations of high cytosine methylation polymorphism within
   Arabidopsis thaliana genes, but reanalyses of these data are consistent
   with conservation of methylation within gene regions. Overall, our
   results indicate that the methylation level is a long-term property of
   individual genes and therefore of evolutionary consequence.

TI H1 linker histone promotes epigenetic silencing by regulating both DNA
   methylation and histone H3 methylation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and
   posttranslational modifications of core histones. Here we show that the
   H1 linker histone plays a key role in regulating both DNA methylation
   and histone H3 methylation at the H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells.
   Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes interact with DNA
   methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are direct and
   require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1
   subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their
   recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control
   regions. H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone
   methyltransferase to the imprinting control regions, inhibiting
   production of an activating methylation mark on histone H3 lysine 4.
   H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and interference with the
   binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in
   vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active role in
   helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic
   silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional
   differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells.

TI Insights into the epigenetic mechanisms controlling pancreatic
   carcinogenesis
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB During the last couple decades, we have significantly advanced our
   understanding of mechanisms underlying the development of pancreatic
   ductual adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, a
   model of PDAC development and progression was developed as a multi-step
   process associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations. The
   correlation and association of these particular genetic aberrations with
   the establishment and progression of PDAC has revolutionized our
   understanding of this process. However, this model leaves out other
   molecular events involved in PDAC pathogenesis that contribute to its
   development and maintenance, specifically those being epigenetic events.
   Thus, a new model considering the new scientific paradigms of
   epigenetics will provide a more comprehensive and useful framework for
   understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease.
   Epigenetics is defined as the type of inheritance not based on a
   particular DNA sequence but rather traits that are passed to the next
   generation via DNA and histone modifications as well as
   microRNA-dependent mechanisms. Key tumor suppressors that are well
   established to play a role in PDAC may be altered through
   hypermethylation, and oncogenes can be upregulated secondary to
   permissive histone modifications. Factors involved in tumor invasiveness
   can be aberrantly expressed through dysregulated microRNAs. A noteworthy
   characteristic of epigenetic-based inheritance is its reversibility,
   which is in contrast to the stable nature of DNA sequence-based
   alterations. Given this nature of epigenetic alterations, it becomes
   imperative that our understanding of epigenetic-based events promoting
   and maintaining PDAC continues to grow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Akt1 as a putative regulator of Hox genes
SO GENE
AB In mammals, mammals, precise spatiotemporal expressions of Hox genes
   control the main body axis during embryogenesis. However, the mechanism
   by which Hox genes are regulated is poorly understood. To discover the
   putative regulator of Hox genes, in silico analyses were performed using
   GEO profiles, and Akt1 emerged as a candidate regulator of Hox genes in
   E13.5 MEFs. The results of the RT-PCR showed that 5' Hoxc genes,
   including ncRNA were upregulated in Akt1 null MEF. Combined bisulfite
   restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing showed that the
   CpG island of a 5' Hoxc gene was hypomethylated in Akt1 null cells.
   These results indicate that Hox expression could be controlled by the
   function of Akt1 through epigenetic modification such as DNA
   methylation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   scaffolds for chromatin-associated proteins. Proteins that specifically
   bind to or "read" these modifications were previously identified in mass
   spectrometry-based proteomics screens based on stable isotope-labeling
   in cell lines. Here we describe a sensitive, label-free histone peptide
   pull-down technology with extracts of different mouse tissues. Applying
   this workflow to the classical activating and repressive epigenetic
   marks on histone H3, H3K4me3, and H3K9me3, we identified known and
   putative readers in extracts from brain, liver, kidney, and testis. A
   large class of proteins were specifically repelled by H3K4me3. Our
   screen reached near-saturation of direct interactors, most of which are
   ubiquitously expressed. In addition, it revealed a number of specialized
   readers in tissues such as testis. Apart from defining the chromatin
   interaction landscape in mouse tissues, our workflow can be used for
   peptides with different modifications and cell types of any organism.

TI UVB-induced COX-2 expression requires histone H3 phosphorylation at
   Ser10 and Ser28
SO ONCOGENE
AB Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that contributes to the
   generation of chronic inflammation in response to chemical carcinogens
   and environmental stresses, including ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation.
   Although post-translational histone modifications are believed to have
   an important role in modulating transcriptional regulation of
   UVB-induced COX-2, the underlying biochemical mechanisms are completely
   unknown. Here, we show that UVB activates the p38 MAPK/MSK1 kinase
   cascade to phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28, contributing to
   UVB-induced COX-2 expression. UVB has no effect on the global
   tri-methylation level of histone H3 (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3). We
   observed that selected mammalian 14-3-3 proteins bind to UVB-induced
   phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10 and Ser28). In particular, 14-3-3
   epsilon is critical for recruiting MSK1 and Cdk9 to the chromatin and
   subsequently phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II
   in the cox-2 promoter. We propose that histone H3 phosphorylation at
   Ser10 and Ser28 serve as critical switches to promote cox-2 gene
   expression by facilitating the recruitment of MSK1 and Cdk9 to the cox-2
   promoter, thereby promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation. Oncogene

TI A SWI/SNF Chromatin-Remodeling Complex Acts in Noncoding RNA-Mediated
   Transcriptional Silencing
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing prevents deleterious effects of
   transposon activity and controls the expression of protein-coding genes.
   It involves long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In Arabidopsis thaliana, some
   of those lncRNAs are produced by a specialized RNA Polymerase V (Pol V).
   The mechanism by which lncRNAs affect chromatin structure and mRNA
   production remains mostly unknown. Here we identify the SWI/SNF
   ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling complex as a component of the
   RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway. We found that SWI3B, an
   essential subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, physically interacts with a
   lncRNA-binding protein, IDN2. SWI/SNF subunits contribute to
   lncRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing. Moreover, Pol V mediates
   stabilization of nucleosomes on silenced regions. We propose that Pol
   V-produced lncRNAs mediate transcriptional silencing by guiding the
   SWI/SNF complex and establishing positioned nucleosomes on specific
   genomic loci. We further propose that guiding ATP-dependent
   chromatin-remodeling complexes may be a more general function of
   lncRNAs.

TI Profiling Genome-Wide Chromatin Methylation with Engineered
   Posttranslation Apparatus within Living Cells
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Protein methyltransferases (PMTs) have emerged as important epigenetic
   regulators in myriad biological processes in both normal physiology and
   disease conditions. However, elucidating PMT-regulated epigenetic
   processes has been hampered by ambiguous knowledge about in vivo
   activities of individual PMTs particularly because of their overlapping
   but nonredundant functions. To address limitations of conventional
   approaches in mapping chromatin modification of specific PMTs, we have
   engineered the chromatin-modifying apparatus and formulated a novel
   technology, termed clickable chromatin enrichment with parallel DNA
   sequencing (CliEn-seq), to probe genome-wide chromatin modification
   within living cells. The three-step approach of CliEn-seq involves in
   vivo synthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analogues from
   cell-permeable methionine analogues by engineered SAM synthetase
   (methionine adenosyltransferase or MAT), in situ chromatin modification
   by engineered PMTs, subsequent enrichment and sequencing of the uniquely
   modified chromatins. Given critical roles of the chromatin-modifying
   enzymes in epigenetics and structural similarity among many PMTs, we
   envision that the CliEn-seq technology is generally applicable in
   deciphering chromatin methylation events of individual PMTs in diverse
   biological settings.

AB Snail and Slug play critical roles in the epithelial to mesenchymal
   transition (EMT), the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and in
   the maintenance of mesenchymal morphology. In this research, we
   investigated the correlation of DNA methylation with the transcriptional
   level of these two genes during the EMT/MET process. First, we used
   several cell lines associated with EMT/MET processes of induced
   pluripotent stem cell generation and differentiation, trophoblast
   invasion, as well as cancer progression to examine the association
   between DNA methylation and transcription levels of these two genes. We
   found an inverse correlation between DNA methylation of first intron
   regions and transcription levels of Snail and Slug genes in these
   EMT/METs. To further verify the results, we treated two trophoblast cell
   line BeWo and HTR8/SVneo and one induced pluripotent stem cell line with
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA
   methyltransferase, which caused increased expression of these two genes.
   Lastly, we cloned the promoters of both Snail and Slug into pGL3-Basic
   vector, after in vitro DNA methylation and transfection into IMR90 and
   HTR8/SVneo cells; we observed the significant reduction of their
   promoter activity due to DNA methylation. In summary, based on these
   results, DNA methylation is one of the molecular mechanisms regulating
   Snail and Slug genes during EMT/MET process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Comprehensive Analysis of Silencing Mutants Reveals Complex Regulation
   of the Arabidopsis Methylome
SO CELL
AB Cytosine methylation is involved in various biological processes such as
   silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and imprinting. Multiple
   pathways regulate DNA methylation in different sequence contexts, but
   the factors that regulate DNA methylation at a given site in the genome
   largely remain unknown. Here we have surveyed the methylomes of a
   comprehensive list of 86 Arabidopsis gene silencing mutants by
   generating single-nucleotide resolution maps of DNA methylation. We find
   that DNA methylation is site specifically regulated by different
   factors. Furthermore, we have identified additional regulators of DNA
   methylation. These data and analyses will serve as a comprehensive
   community resource for further understanding the control of DNA
   methylation patterning.

TI Gene regulation by the lysine demethylase KDM4A in Drosophila
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally
   active chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is
   modified. Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that
   histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle-
   or developmental stage. KDM4A demethylates H3K36me3, a modification
   enriched in the 3' end of active genes. The genomic targets and the role
   of KDM4 proteins in development remain largely unknown. We therefore
   generated KDM4A mutant Drosophila, and identified 99 mis-regulated genes
   in first instar larvae. Around half of these genes were down-regulated
   and the other half up-regulated in dKDM4A mutants. Although
   heterochromatin protein la (HP1a) can stimulate dKDM4A demethylase
   activity in vitro, we find that they antagonize each other in control of
   dKDM4A-regulated genes. Appropriate expression levels for some
   dKDM4A-regulated genes rely on the demethylase activity of dKDM4A,
   whereas others do not. Surprisingly, although highly expressed, many
   demethylase-dependent and independent genes are devoid of H3K36me3 in
   wild-type as well as in dKDM4A mutant larvae, suggesting that some of
   the most strongly affected genes in dKDM4A mutant animals are not
   regulated by H3K36 methylation. By contrast, dKDM4A over-expression
   results in a global decrease in H3K36me3 levels and male lethality,
   which might be caused by impaired dosage compensation. Our results show
   that a modest increase in global H3K36me3 levels is compatible with
   viability, fertility, and the expression of most genes, whereas
   decreased H3K36me3 levels are detrimental in males. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Triclosan exposure alters postembryonic development in a Pacific tree
   frog (Pseudacris regilla) Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (TREEMA)
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB The Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (AMA), developed for Xenopus laevis,
   is designed to identify chemicals that disrupt thyroid hormone
   (TH)-mediated biological processes. We adapted the AMA for use on an
   ecologically-relevant North American species, the Pacific tree frog
   (Pseudacris regilla), and applied molecular endpoints to evaluate the
   effects of the antibacterial agent, triclosan (TCS). Premetamorphic
   (Gosner stage 26-28) tadpoles were immersed for 21 days in solvent
   control, 1.5 mu g/L thyroxine (T(4)), 0.3, 3 and 30 mu g/L (nominal)
   TCS, or combined T(4)/TCS treatments. Exposure effects were scored by
   morphometric (developmental stage, wet weight, and body, snout-vent and
   hindlimb lengths) and molecular (mRNA abundance using quantitative real
   time polymerase chain reaction) criteria. T(4) treatment alone
   accelerated development concomitant with altered levels of TH receptors
   alpha and beta, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and gelatinase B
   mRNAs in the brain and tail. We observed TCS-induced perturbations in
   all of the molecular and morphological endpoints indicating that TCS
   exposure disrupts coordination of postembryonic tadpole development.
   Clear alterations in molecular endpoints were evident at day 2 whereas
   the earliest morphological effects appeared at day 4 and were most
   evident at day 21. Although TCS alone (3 and 30 mu g/L) was protective
   against tadpole mortality, this protection was lost in the presence of
   T(4). The Pacific tree frog is the most sensitive species examined to
   date displaying disruption of TH-mediated development by a common
   antimicrobial agent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Inhibition of the thyroid hormone pathway in Xenopus laevis by
   2-mercaptobenzothiazole
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB Determining the effects of chemicals on the thyroid system is an
   important aspect of evaluating chemical safety from an endocrine
   disrupter perspective. Since there are numerous chemicals to test and
   limited resources, prioritizing chemicals for subsequent in vivo testing
   is critical. 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), a high production volume
   chemical, was tested and shown to inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
   enzyme activity in vitro, a key enzyme necessary for the synthesis of
   thyroid hormone. To determine the thyroid disrupting activity of MBT in
   vivo, Xenopus laevis larvae were exposed using 7- and 21-day protocols.
   The 7-day protocol used 18-357 mu g/L MBT concentrations and evaluated:
   metamorphic development, thyroid histology, circulating T4, circulating
   thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter gene
   expression, and thyroidal T4, T3, and related iodo-amino acids. The
   21-day protocol used 23-435 mu g/L MBT concentrations and evaluated
   metamorphic development and thyroid histology. Both protocols
   demonstrated that MBT is a thyroid disrupting chemical at the lowest
   concentrations tested. These studies complement the in vitro study used
   to identify MBT as a high priority for in vivo testing, supporting the
   utility/predictive potential of a tiered approach to testing chemicals
   for TPO activity inhibition. The 7-day study, with more comprehensive,
   sensitive, and diagnostic endpoints, provides information at
   intermediate biological levels that enables linking various endpoints in
   a robust and integrated pathway for thyroid hormone disruption
   associated with TPO inhibition. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI GATA4 and DcR1 methylation in glioblastomas
SO DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
AB Background: Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes plays
   important role in gliomagenesis. Recently, GATA4 and DcR1 were suggested
   to be a tumor suppressor genes involved in tumorigenesis in various
   types of human cancers. However, up to now the methylation frequency of
   GATA4 and DcR1 genes has not been determined in glioblastoma. In this
   study, we investigated methylation of GATA4 and DcR1 promoters and their
   association with patient prognosis in glioblastoma.
   Methods: Methylation status of GATA4 and DcR1 promoters was investigated
   by methylation specific PCR in 99 glioblastoma patients. Statistical
   analyses were conducted to investigate the association between clinical
   variables and overall survival time.
   Results: GATA4 and DcR1 were aberrantly methylated in 23.2% and 27.6% of
   glioblastoma tumors, but not in normal brain. GATA4 promoter
   hypermethylation showed significant association with patients age (p =
   0.027). Relationship between genes promoter methylation and glioblastoma
   patient survival was not determined.
   Conclusions: The present work demonstrated that GATA4 and DcR1 promoter
   hypermethylation is tumor specific event in glioblastoma but they
   promoter methylation cannot be considered as a prognostic marker of
   glioblastoma survival.

TI Exposure of zebrafish embryos/larvae to TDCPP alters concentrations of
   thyroid hormones and transcriptions of genes involved in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) has been frequently
   detected in the environment and in various biota, including fish, and
   has been implicated in disruption of the thyroid endocrine system. In
   the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to
   different concentrations of TDCPP (10, 50, 100, 300 and 600 mu g/L) from
   2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf. Developmental endpoints, and
   whole-body concentrations of thyroid hormones and transcriptional
   profiles of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT)
   axis were examined. Exposure to TDCPP caused a dose-dependent
   developmental toxicity, including decreased body weight, reduced
   hatching, survival and heartbeat rates, and increased malformation
   (spinal curvature). Treatment with the positive control chemical
   3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) significantly decreased whole-body
   thyroxin (T4) concentrations, increased whole-body T3 concentrations,
   and upregulated mRNA expression involved in the HPT axis as a
   compensatory mechanism. These results suggested that the HPT axis in
   144-hpf zebrafish larvae was responsive to chemical exposure and could
   be used to evaluate the effects of chemicals on the thyroid endocrine
   system. TDCPP exposure significantly decreased whole-body T4
   concentrations and increased whole-body T3 concentrations, indicating
   thyroid endocrine disruption. The upregulation of genes related to
   thyroid hormone metabolism (dio1 and ugt1ab) might be responsible for
   decreased T4 concentrations. Treatment with TDCPP also significantly
   increased transcription of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis
   (tsh beta, slc5a5 and tg) and thyroid development (hhex, nkx2.1 and
   pax8) as a compensatory mechanism for decreased T4 concentrations. Taken
   together, these results suggest that TDCPP alters the transcription of
   genes involved in the HPT axis and changes whole-body concentrations of
   thyroid hormones in zebrafish embryos/larvae, thus causing an endocrine
   disruption of the thyroid system. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Corticosterone modulates fear responses and the expression of
   glucocorticoid receptors in the brain of high-anxiety rats
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB The aim of our experiments was to assess the effect of acutely
   administered corticosterone on the expression of glucocorticoid
   receptors (GRs) in the brain of rats with high (HR) and low (LR) levels
   of anxiety. The rats were divided into groups according to their
   conditioned fear-induced freezing responses and then were subjected to a
   second conditioned fear session one week after the initial fear
   conditioning. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the second
   exposure to contextual aversive stimuli resulted in higher levels of GRs
   expression in cingulate cortex area 1 (Cg1), the secondary motor cortex
   (M2) of the prefrontal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
   (DG) in LR rats compared with HR rats. The pretreatment of HR rats with
   corticosterone (20 mg/kg, sc) increased the expression levels of GRs in
   Cg1, the M2 area and the DG to the levels observed in the LR vehicle
   group. The increase in the GRs levels was accompanied by a significant
   decrease in the conditioned fear response in the HR group. The control
   animals that were not exposed to aversive stimuli had similar levels of
   receptor-related immunoreactivity in all brain regions, and
   corticosterone did not change these expression levels. Our results
   suggest that HR animals may have deficits in the expression of
   stress-induced GRs in the prefrontal cortex and the DG. In addition,
   pretreatment with corticosterone increases the expression of GRs and
   normalizes the fear response in HR rats. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Genome-wide identification of Epstein-Barr virus-driven promoter
   methylation profiles of human genes in gastric cancer cells
SO CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of tumor-related genes has been
   reported in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric cancers. This
   study sought to profile EBV-driven hypermethylation in EBV-infected
   cells. METHODS: The EBV-positive AGS gastric cancer cell line (AGS-EBV)
   and EBV-negative AGS cells were used in this study. DNA
   methyltransferase-3b (DNMT3b) activity was assessed by EpiQuick activity
   assay, and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were assessed by
   methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation microarray assay. RESULTS: EBV infection
   was confirmed in AGS-EBV cells by EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization.
   Expression and activity of DNA methyltransferase-3b (DNMT3b) was
   significantly increased in AGS-EBV compared to AGS. Ectopic expression
   of LMP2A (latent membrane protein 2A) in AGS increased activity of
   DNMT3b. A total of 1065 genes were differentially methylated by EBV
   infection (fold-changes = 2, P < .05) in AGS-EBV compared to AGS cells.
   The majority of the differentially methylated genes (83.2%, 886 of 1065
   genes) had cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) hypermethylation in
   AGS-EBV (fold-changes 2.43 similar to 65.2) versus that found in AGS
   cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed that hypermethylated genes were
   enriched in the important cancer pathways (= 10 genes each, P = .05)
   including mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, cell adhesion
   molecules, wnt signaling pathway, and so forth. Six novel
   hypermethylated candidates (IL15RA, REC8, SSTR1, EPHB6, MDGA2, and
   SCARF2) were further validated. Higher levels of DNA methylation were
   confirmed for all these genes in AGS-EBV cells by bisulfite genomic
   sequencing. Furthermore, these candidates were silenced or
   down-regulated in AGS-EBV cells, but can be restored by demethylation
   treatment. CONCLUSIONS: EBV infection in AGS cells induced aberrant CpG
   hypermethylation of 886 genes involving in important cancer-related
   pathways. Induction of promoter methylation by EBV is regulated by
   up-regulation of DNMT3b through LMP2A. Cancer 2013. (c) 2012 American

TI Structural Insight into Coordinated Recognition of Trimethylated Histone
   H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by the Plant Homeodomain (PHD) and Tandem Tudor
   Domain (TTD) of UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, Containing PHD and RING Finger
   Domains, 1) Protein
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB UHRF1 is an important epigenetic regulator connecting DNA methylation
   and histone methylations. UHRF1 is required for maintenance of DNA
   methylation through recruiting DNMT1 to DNA replication forks. Recent
   studies have shown that the plant homeodomain (PHD) of UHRF1 recognizes
   the N terminus of unmodified histone H3, and the interaction is
   inhibited by methylation of H3R2, whereas the tandem tudor domain (TTD)
   of UHRF1 recognizes trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3).
   However, how the two domains of UHRF1 coordinately recognize histone
   methylations remains elusive. In this report, we identified that PHD
   largely enhances the interaction between TTD and H3K9me3. We present the
   crystal structure of UHRF1 containing both TTD and PHD (TTD-PHD) in
   complex with H3K9m3 peptide at 3.0 angstrom resolution. The structure
   shows that TTD-PHD binds to the H3K9me3 peptide with 1:1 stoichiometry
   with the two domains connected by the H3K9me3 peptide and a linker
   region. The TTD interacts with residues Arg-8 and trimethylated Lys-9,
   and the PHD interacts with residues Ala-1, Arg-2, and Lys-4 of the
   H3K9me3 peptide. The biochemical experiments indicate that PHD-mediated
   recognition of unmodified H3 is independent of the TTD, whereas
   TTD-mediated recognition of H3K9me3 PHD. Thus, both TTD and PHD are
   essential for specific recognition of H3K9me3 by UHRF1. Interestingly,
   the H3K9me3 peptide induces conformational changes of TTD-PHD, which do
   not affect the autoubiquitination activity or hemimethylated DNA binding
   affinity of UHRF1 in vitro. Taken together, our studies provide
   structural insight into the coordinated recognition of H3K9me3 by the
   TTD and PHD of UHRF1.

TI Folic acid enforces DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing
   of PTEN, APC and RARbeta2 tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Folate, one of the most studied dietary compounds, has recently become
   the main topic of debates on food fortification. Although low folate
   levels may be associated with increased risk of cancer development,
   simultaneously several reports indicate a detrimental effects mediated
   by high folate concentrations. Using the methylation sensitive
   restriction analysis (MSRA) and real-time RT-PCR we tested the effect of
   folic acid on DNA promoter methylation and expression of PTEN, APC and
   RARbeta2 tumour suppressor genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
   cell lines with different invasive capacity. The tested genes encode
   proteins involved in regulation of oncogenic intracellular signaling
   pathways. The results show that the increasing concentrations of folic
   acid lead to a dose-dependent down-regulation of tumour suppressor genes
   which may be linked to the increased DNA methylation detected within
   their promoter regions. The effects were more remarkable in non-invasive
   MCF-7 cells where we also observed 30% up-regulation of DNMT1 expression
   at the highest folate concentration used. Our findings show that caution
   need to be used when introducing folic acid supplementation since it may
   lead to cancer progression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of Threonine Metabolism on S-Adenosylmethionine and Histone
   Methylation
SO SCIENCE
AB Threonine is the only amino acid critically required for the
   pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), but the detailed
   mechanism remains unclear. We found that threonine and
   S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism are coupled in pluripotent stem
   cells, resulting in regulation of histone methylation. Isotope labeling
   of mESCs revealed that threonine provides a substantial fraction of both
   the cellular glycine and the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) needed for SAM
   synthesis. Depletion of threonine from the culture medium or threonine
   dehydrogenase (Tdh) from mESCs decreased accumulation of SAM and
   decreased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), leading to
   slowed growth and increased differentiation. Thus, abundance of SAM
   appears to influence H3K4me3, providing a possible mechanism by which
   modulation of a metabolic pathway might influence stem cell fate.

AB The majority of the genome in eukaryotes is packaged into
   transcriptionally inactive chromatin. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is
   a major player in the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin.
   HP1 specifically recognizes a methylated lysine residue at position 9 in
   histone H3 through its N-terminal chromo domain (CD). To elucidate the
   binding properties of HP1 alpha to nucleosomes in vitro, we
   reconstituted nudeosomes containing histone H3 trimethylated at lysine
   9. HP1 alpha exhibited high-affinity binding to nucleosomes containing
   methylated histone H3 in a nucleosome core-number-dependent manner. The
   hinge region (HR) connecting the CD and C-terminal chromoshadow domain
   (CSD), and the CSD contributed to the selective binding of HP1 alpha to
   histone H3 with trimethylated lysine 9 through weak DNA binding and by
   suppressing the DNA binding, respectively. We propose that not only the
   specific recognition of lysine 9 methylation of histone H3 by the CD but
   also the HR and the CSD cooperatively contribute to the selective
   binding of HP1 a to histone H3 lysine 9 methylated nucleosomes. (C) 2012

TI Histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a represses PPAR gamma expression and
   adipogenesis
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB PPAR gamma promotes adipogenesis while Wnt proteins inhibit
   adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms that control expression of these
   positive and negative master regulators of adipogenesis remain
   incompletely understood. By genome-wide histone methylation profiling in
   preadipocytes, we find that among gene loci encoding adipogenesis
   regulators, histone methyltransferase (HMT) G9a-mediated repressive
   epigenetic mark H3K9me2 is selectively enriched on the entire PPAR gamma
   locus. H3K9me2 and G9a levels decrease during adipogenesis, which
   correlates inversely with induction of PPAR gamma. Removal of H3K9me2 by
   G9a deletion enhances chromatin opening and binding of the early
   adipogenic transcription factor C/EBP beta to PPAR gamma promoter, which
   promotes PPAR gamma expression. Interestingly, G9a represses PPAR gamma
   expression in an HMT activity-dependent manner but facilitates Wnt10a
   expression independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, deletion
   of G9a or inhibiting G9a HMT activity promotes adipogenesis. Finally,
   deletion of G9a in mouse adipose tissues increases adipogenic gene
   expression and tissue weight. Thus, by inhibiting PPAR gamma expression
   and facilitating Wnt10a expression, G9a represses adipogenesis. The EMBO

TI DNA methylation changes are a late event in acute promyelocytic leukemia
   and coincide with loss of transcription factor binding
SO BLOOD
AB The origin of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer remains largely
   unknown. In the present study, we elucidated the DNA methylome in
   primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the role of promyelocytic
   leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RAR alpha) in establishing
   these patterns. Cells from APL patients showed increased genome-wide DNA
   methylation with higher variability than healthy CD34(+) cells,
   promyelocytes, and remission BM cells. A core set of differentially
   methylated regions in APL was identified. Age at diagnosis, Sanz score,
   and Flt3-mutation status characterized methylation subtypes.
   Transcription factor-binding sites (eg, the c-myc-binding sites) were
   associated with low methylation. However, SUZ12- and REST-binding sites
   identified in embryonic stem cells were preferentially DNA
   hypermethylated in APL cells. Unexpectedly, PML-RAR alpha-binding sites
   were also protected from aberrant DNA methylation in APL cells.
   Consistent with this, myeloid cells from preleukemic PML-RAR alpha
   knock-in mice did not show altered DNA methylation and the expression of
   PML-RAR alpha in hematopoietic progenitor cells prevented
   differentiation without affecting DNA methylation. Treatment of APL
   blasts with all-trans retinoic acid also did not result in immediate DNA
   methylation changes. The results of the present study suggest that
   aberrant DNA methylation is associated with leukemia phenotype but is
   not required for PML-RAR alpha-mediated initiation of leukemogenesis.

TI Influence of HRH2 promoter polymorphism on aberrant DNA methylation of
   DAPK and CDH1 in the gastric epithelium
SO BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Background: Aberrant methylation patterns in CpG island are known to be
   influential in gene silencing. Histamine plays important physiological
   roles in the upper gastrointestinal tract and acts via the H2 receptor.
   We report an investigation into the effect of HRH2 promoter polymorphism
   (rs2607474 G > A) on the methylation of DAPK and CDH1.
   Methods: Non cancerous gastric mucosa samples were obtained from 115
   subjects with gastric cancer (GC) and 412 non-cancer subjects (non-GC).
   Methylation status of genes was determined by MSP. The genotyping of
   rs2607474 was performed by PCR-SSCP.
   Results: Methylation of DAPK and CDH1 was observed in 296 and 246
   subjects, respectively. The frequency of CDH1 methylation in the
   subjects with GC was significantly lower in cancer lesion than in non
   cancerous mucosa, whereas that of DAPK methylation was not different.
   The allelic distribution of rs2607474 was 401GG, 119GA and 7AA. The GG
   homozygote was associated with a significantly increased risk for
   methylation of both DAPK and CDH1 (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0009,
   respectively). In the non-GC subjects or more than 60 years of age, GG
   homozygote was more closely associated with both DAPK and CDH1
   methylation. However, this genotype did not show an increased risk for
   the development of methylation of both genes in patients with GC. In H.
   pylori negative subjects, GG homozygote showed an increased risk for the
   methylation of both DAPK and CDH1 (p = 0.0074 and p = 0.0016,
   respectively), whereas this genotype was associated with an increased
   risk for the development of DAPK methylation in H. pylori positive
   subjects (p = 0.0018). In addition, in subjects older than 60 years of
   age, atrophy and metaplasia scores were significantly higher in the GG
   homozygote (p = 0.011 and p = 0.039, respectively) and a significant
   correlation was observed between age and atrophy or metaplasia.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that rs2607474 GG homozygote confers a
   significantly increased risk for age-and inflammation-related DAPK and
   CDH1 methylation.

TI Inter-island differences in the corticosterone responses of North Island
   Saddlebacks (Philesturnus rufusater) in New Zealand do not suggest
   selective effects of translocation
SO EMU
AB North Island Saddlebacks (Philesturnus rufusater) have been the subject
   of a well-documented sequence of translocations to isolated islands
   around New Zealand. We measured corticosterone stress responses in North
   Island Saddlebacks derived from the ancestral population and from a
   series of three sequential translocations. Each translocation might
   impose a selective pressure on the founder populations of North Island
   Saddleback. This selective filter might favour a particular
   corticosterone response linked through an associated coping ability.
   Evidence of selection would be reflected in a progressive shift in the
   mean corticosterone response related to the number of sequential
   translocations. Mean corticosterone responses to a standardised stressor
   were highest in birds descended from a population subject to two
   sequential translocations. However, responses measured at localities
   representing the original source population and populations derived from
   one and three sequential translocations were not significantly different
   from each other. Accordingly, our data suggest that translocations do
   not necessarily cause directional selection on the stress responses of
   these vulnerable populations of birds.

TI Differences in egg deposition of corticosterone and embryonic expression
   of corticosterone metabolic enzymes between slow and fast growing
   broiler chickens
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) are vital for embryonic development and their
   bioactivity is regulated by the intracellular metabolism involving 11
   beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11 beta-HSDs) and 20-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase (20-HSD). Here we sought to reveal the differences in egg
   deposition of corticosterone and embryonic expression of corticosterone
   metabolic enzymes between slow and fast growing broiler chickens (Gallus
   gallus). Eggs of fast-growing breed contained significantly higher
   (P<0.05) corticosterone in the yolk and albumen, compared with that of a
   slow-growing breed. 11 beta-HSD1 and 11 beta-HSD2 were expressed in
   relatively higher abundance in the liver, kidney and intestine,
   following similar tissue-specific ontogenic patterns. In the liver,
   expression of both 11 beta-HSD1 and 11 beta-HSD2 was upregulated
   (P<0.05) towards hatching, yet 20-HSD displayed distinct pattern showing
   a significant decrease (P<0.05) on posthatch day 1 (D1). Hepatic mRNA
   expression of 11 beta-HSD1 and 11 beta-HSD2 was significantly higher in
   fast-growing chicken embryos at all the embryonic stages investigated
   and so was the hepatic protein content on embryonic day of 14 (E14) for
   11 beta-HSD1 and on E14 and D1 for 11 beta-HSD2. 20-HSD mRNA was higher
   in fast-growing chicken embryos only on E14. Our data provide the first
   evidence that egg deposition of corticosterone, as well as the hepatic
   expression of glucocorticoid metabolic enzymes, differs between
   fast-growing and slow-growing chickens, which may account, to some
   extent, for the breed disparities in embryonic development. (C) 2012

TI DNA methylation-specific multiplex assays for body fluid identification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
AB Recent advances in whole-genome epigenetic analysis indicate that
   chromosome segments called tissue-specific differentially methylated
   regions (tDMRs) show different DNA methylation profiles according to
   cell or tissue type. Therefore, body fluid-specific differential DNA
   methylation is a promising indicator for body fluid identification.
   However, DNA methylation patterns are susceptible to change in response
   to environmental factors and aging. Therefore, we investigated
   age-related methylation changes in semen-specific tDMRs using body
   fluids from young and elderly men. After confirming the stability of the
   body fluid-specific DNA methylation profile over time, two different
   multiplex PCR systems were constructed using methylation-sensitive
   restriction enzyme PCR and methylation SNaPshot, in order to analyze the
   methylation status of specific CpG sites from the USP49, DACT1, PRMT2,
   and PFN3 tDMRs. Both multiplex systems could successfully identify semen
   with spermatozoa and could differentiate menstrual blood and vaginal
   fluids from blood and saliva. Although including more markers for body
   fluid identification might be necessary, this study adds to the support
   that body fluid identification by DNA methylation profiles could be a
   valuable tool for forensic analysis of body fluids.

SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Interactions between DNA and transcription factors (TFs) guide cellular
   function and development, yet the complexities of gene regulation are
   still far from being understood. Such understanding is limited by a
   paucity of techniques with which to probe DNA-protein interactions. We
   have devised magnetic protein immobilization on enhancer DNA (MagPIE), a
   simple, rapid, multi-parametric assay using flow cytometric
   immunofluorescence to reveal interactions among TFs, chromatin structure
   and DNA. In MagPIE, synthesized DNA is bound to magnetic beads, which
   are then incubated with nuclear lysate, permitting sequence-specific
   binding by TFs, histones and methylation by native lysate factors that
   can be optionally inhibited with small molecules. Lysate protein-DNA
   binding is monitored by flow cytometric immunofluorescence, which allows
   for accurate comparative measurement of TF-DNA affinity. Combinatorial
   fluorescent staining allows simultaneous analysis of sequence-specific
   TF-DNA interaction and chromatin modification. MagPIE provides a simple
   and robust method to analyze complex epigenetic interactions in vitro.

TI Modeling of epigenome dynamics identifies transcription factors that
   mediate Polycomb targeting
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Although changes in chromatin are integral to transcriptional
   reprogramming during cellular differentiation, it is currently unclear
   how chromatin modifications are targeted to specific loci. To
   systematically identify transcription factors (TFs) that can direct
   chromatin changes during cell fate decisions, we model the relationship
   between genomewide dynamics of chromatin marks and the local occurrence
   of computationally predicted TF binding sites. By applying this
   computational approach to a time course of Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3
   marks during neuronal differentiation of murine stem cells, we identify
   several motifs that likely regulate the dynamics of this chromatin mark.
   Among these, the sites bound by REST and by the SNAIL family of TFs are
   predicted to transiently recruit H3K27me3 in neuronal progenitors. We
   validate these predictions experimentally and show that absence of REST
   indeed causes loss of H3K27me3 at target promoters in trans,
   specifically at the neuronal progenitor state. Moreover, using targeted
   transgenic insertion, we show that promoter fragments containing REST or
   SNAIL binding sites are sufficient to recruit H3K27me3 in cis, while
   deletion of these sites results in loss of H3K27me3. These findings
   illustrate that the occurrence of TF binding sites can determine
   chromatin dynamics. Local determination of Polycomb activity by REST and
   SNAIL motifs exemplifies such TF based regulation of chromatin.
   Furthermore, our results show that key TFs can be identified ab initio
   through computational modeling of epigenome data sets using a modeling
   approach that we make readily accessible.

TI Dynamic DNA methylation: a prime candidate for genomic metaplasticity
   and behavioral adaptation
SO TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES
AB DNA methylation was once considered to be a static epigenetic
   modification whose primary function was restricted to directing the
   development of cellular phenotype. However, it is now evident that the
   methylome is dynamically regulated across the lifespan: during
   development as a putative mechanism by which early experience leaves a
   lasting signature on the genome and during adulthood as a function of
   behavioral adaptation. Here, we propose that experience-dependent
   variations in DNA methylation, particularly within the context of
   learning and memory, represent a form of genomic metaplasticity that
   serves to prime the transcriptional response to later learning-related
   stimuli and neuronal reactivation.

TI Ethanol-Induced Htr3a Promoter Methylation Changes in Mouse Blood and
   Brain
SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background Abnormal DNA methylation has been observed in promoter
   regions of a number of genes in human alcoholics. It is unclear whether
   DNA methylation changes in alcoholics result directly from alcohol
   consumption or predated the occurrence of alcohol abuse or dependence
   and whether altered DNA methylation influences gene expression. Methods
   We investigated ethanol (EtOH)-induced DNA methylation changes in mouse
   serotonin receptor 3a gene (Htr3a). A 5-day drinking-in-the-dark
   paradigm was applied to 28 male outbred CD-1 mice (15 EtOH-drinking and
   13 water-drinking). The Sequenom MassARRAY approach was used to quantify
   methylation levels of 8 CpGs around Htr3a transcription start site in
   trunk blood and 9 brain regions (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [DMPFC],
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area, dorsolateral
   striatum, dorsomedial striatum [DMSTR], ventral striatum, amygdala,
   hippocampus [HIPPO], and cerebellum). DNA methylation differences
   between the 2 groups of mice (EtOH- and water-drinking) were analyzed
   using multivariate analysis of covariance with consideration of EtOH
   consumption amount. Expression levels of Htr3a in the DMSTR were
   measured by real-time PCR in 14 EtOH-drinking and 14 water-drinking male
   CD-1 mice. Results EtOH drinking increased methylation levels of
   specific Htr3a promoter CpGs in mouse blood (CpG-27: p = 0.028; CpG+54:
   p = 0.044) and HIPPO (CpG+151: p = 0.012) but reduced methylation levels
   of specific Htr3a promoter CpGs in mouse DMSTR (CpG-96: p = 0.020;
   CpG-27: p = 0.035) and DMPFC (CpG+138: p = 0.011; CpG+151: p = 0.040).
   Nevertheless, methylation levels of Htr3a promoter CpGs in 6 other brain
   regions were not significantly altered by EtOH consumption.
   Additionally, the expression level of Htr3a in the DMSTR was 1.43-fold
   higher in alcohol-drinking mice than in water-drinking mice (p = 0.044).
   Conclusions Our findings indicate that alcohol consumption may induce
   tissue-specific DNA methylation changes and further suggest that Htr3a
   promoter methylation levels may be reversely correlated with Htr3a
   expression levels in specific brain regions such as DMSTR.

TI Identification of a CpG Island Methylator Phenotype in Adrenocortical
   Carcinomas
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Purpose: DNA methylation is a mechanism for gene expression silencing in
   cancer. Limited information is available for adrenocortical tumors.
   Abnormal methylation at the IGF2/H19 locus is common in adrenocortical
   carcinomas. Our aim was to characterize the methylation in
   adrenocortical carcinomas at a whole-genome scale and to assess its
   clinical significance and its impact on gene expression.
   Experimental Design: Methylation patterns of CpG islands in promoter
   regions of 51 adrenocortical carcinomas and 84 adenomas were studied by
   the Infinium Human Methylation27 Beadchip (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
   Methylation of 33 genes was studied by methylation-specific multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The
   Netherlands) in 15 carcinomas. Gene expression data were available for
   87 tumors from a previous study (HG-U133Plus2.0 AffymetrixGeneChip;
   Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Clinical information, including patient
   features and survival, were available for all tumors.
   Results: Methylation was higher in carcinomas than in adenomas (t test P
   = 3.1 x 10(-9)). Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation profiles
   identified two groups of carcinomas, one with an elevated methylation
   level, evoking a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). The subgroup of
   hypermethylated carcinomas was further divided in two subgroups, with
   different levels of methylation (CIMP-high and CIMP-low). This
   classification could be confirmed by methylation-specific multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification. Hypermethylation was associated
   with a poor survival (Cox model P = 0.02). The transcriptome/methylation
   correlation showed 1741 genes (of 12,250) negatively correlated; among
   the top genes were H19 and other tumor suppressors (PLAGL-1, G0S2, and

   Conclusions: This genome-wide methylation analysis reveals the existence
   of hypermethylated adrenocortical carcinomas, with a poorer prognosis.
   Hypermethylation in these tumors is important for silencing specific
   tumor suppressor genes. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: E174-E184, 2013)

TI UHRF1 discriminates against binding to fully-methylated CpG-Sites by
   steric repulsion
SO BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Cytosine methylation of CpG dinucleotide sequence is an epigenetic mark
   on the DNA that regulates gene expression, chromatin structure, and
   genome stability. Although the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation
   reaction after replication is Dnmt1, it was found that the protein UHRF1
   is essential for maintaining DNA methylation. UHRF1 exhibits
   preferential binding to hemi-methylated DNA relative to both
   unmethylated and fully-methylated DNA strands. In this paper we report
   results from molecular dynamics simulations aiming to elucidate the
   mechanism for the discrimination of UHRF1 to bind fully-methylated DNA.
   From alchemical mutation free energy calculations we find that the
   binding affinity of fully-methylated DNA to UHRF1 is weaker by 17.9
   kJ/mol relative to the binding of hemi-methylated DNA Structural
   analyses reveal, in agreement with the steric clash model, that a methyl
   group at the C5 position of the target cytosine induces a displacement
   of the NKR finger domain away from the DNA. As a result a net loss of,
   approximately, one hydrogen bond between the protein and the DNA is
   observed. These weakened protein-DNA interactions are located between
   the target cytosine and the NKR domain, as well as, between the flipped
   methylcytosine and the binding pocket of the SRA domain. Due to the
   conformational changes of the fully-methylated bound complex, water
   molecules intrude the protein-DNA interface and substitute the majority
   of the hydrogen bonds that are lost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Differential gene expression during metamorphosis: a promising approach
   for age estimation of forensically important Calliphora vicina pupae
   (Diptera: Calliphoridae)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
AB Necrophagous blow fly larvae can provide accurate estimates of the
   minimum postmortem interval in death investigations. During larval
   development, predictable morphological changes occur and measurements of
   weight, length, and width are compared to species-specific growth curves
   for reliable age estimates. However, aging blow fly pupae is more
   challenging because morphological and anatomical changes are not visible
   with the naked eye. Thus, delicate preparation of the pupae or rearing
   to the adult stage seems unavoidable. Conversely, metamorphosis evokes a
   remodelling of the larval shape to adult structures, and gene expression
   analysis potentially serves as a molecular tool to mirror the ageing
   process of a pupa. The present study focuses on the differential
   expression of two newly described, arbitrarily named genes (15_2,
   2014192) and two previously identified genes (actin, arylphorin
   receptor) during Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae)
   metamorphosis. Quantification through real-time PCR revealed significant
   up- and downregulation of these transcripts found to be temperature
   dependent and age specific, hence, a new possibility to age forensically
   important blow fly pupae.

TI Thyroid (dys-)function in normal and disturbed pregnancy
SO ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
AB During pregnancy, physiologic changes in maternal thyroid function take
   place especially due to hormonal as well as metabolic processes. Human
   chorionic gonadotropin activates the maternal thyroid gland leading to
   increased thyroid hormone production. A sufficient availability of
   maternal thyroid hormones is essential for fetal development, especially
   during the first trimester of pregnancy, when the fetal thyroid gland is
   not yet functional.
   Current knowledge of thyroid dysfunction including thyroid autoimmunity,
   hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is summarized with special focus on
   miscarriage and pregnancy disorders. Therefore, a Medline research as
   well as an analysis of current guidelines on thyroid function and
   pregnancy was performed.
   A study focusing on TSH levels in normal and disturbed pregnancies, the
   risk of miscarriage in association with thyroid autoantibodies, and
   (subclinical) hypothyroidism in infertile and fertile women were
   included.
   Maternal thyroid dysfunction negatively affects pregnancy outcome.
   Besides a routine iodine supplementation in pregnant women and treatment
   of hypo as well as hyperthyroidism, TSH levels should routinely be
   measured in women during childbearing years and adjusted to
   concentrations < 2.5 mIU/l in order to optimize maternal health and
   fetal development.

TI Expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators SNAI2 and
   TWIST1 in thyroid carcinomas
SO MODERN PATHOLOGY
AB Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is an important mechanism of
   epithelial tumor progression, local invasion and metastasis. The
   E-cadherin (CDH1) repressor SLUG (SNAI2) and the basic helix-loop-helix
   transcription factor TWIST1 inhibit CDH1 expression in poorly
   differentiated malignancies as inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been implicated in
   progression from well to poorly differentiated/anaplastic thyroid
   carcinoma but the expression of SNAI2 and TWIST1 proteins and their
   phenotypic association in human thyroid cancers has not been extensively
   studied. We examined the expression of SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1 by
   immunohistochemistry in a panel of well-differentiated and anaplastic
   thyroid cancers and by qRT-PCR in thyroid cell lines. Ten normal
   thyroids, 33 follicular adenomas, 56 papillary thyroid carcinomas
   including 28 follicular variants, 27 follicular carcinomas and 10
   anaplastic thyroid carcinomas were assembled on a tissue microarray and
   immunostained for SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1. Most (8/10) anaplastic thyroid
   carcinomas demonstrated strong nuclear immunoreactivity for SNAI2 with
   associated absence of CDH1 in 6/8 cases (75%). TWIST1 was expressed in
   5/10 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas with absence of CDH1 in 3/5 (60%)
   cases. These findings were confirmed in whole sections of all anaplastic
   thyroid carcinomas and in a separate validation set of 10 additional
   anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. All normal thyroids, follicular adenomas,
   papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas were negative for SNAI2 and
   TWIST1 (P<0.0001) and all showed strong diffuse immunoreactivity for
   CDH1 (P=0.026). Expression of SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1 mRNA varied in a
   normal thyroid, papillary carcinoma and two anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
   cell lines tested, but the highest levels of CDH1 mRNA were detected in
   the normal thyroid cell line while the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell
   line demonstrated the highest levels of SNAI2 and TWIST1 mRNA. Our
   findings support the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the
   development of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Modern Pathology (2013) 26,

TI 450K-array analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells reveals global
   DNA methylation to be relatively stable over time and similar in resting
   and proliferative compartments
SO LEUKEMIA
AB In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the microenvironment influences
   gene expression patterns; however, knowledge is limited regarding the
   extent to which methylation changes with time and exposure to specific
   microenvironments. Using high-resolution 450K arrays, we provide the
   most comprehensive DNA methylation study of CLL to date, analyzing
   paired diagnostic/follow-up samples from IGHV-mutated/untreated and
   IGHV-unmutated/treated patients (n = 36) and patient-matched peripheral
   blood and lymph node samples (n = 20). On an unprecedented scale, we
   revealed 2239 differentially methylated CpG sites between IGHV-mutated
   and unmutated patients, with the majority of sites positioned outside
   annotated CpG islands. Intriguingly, CLL prognostic genes (for example,
   CLLU1, LPL, ZAP70 and NOTCH1), epigenetic regulator (for example, HDAC9,
   HDAC4 and DNMT3B), B-cell signaling (for example, IBTK) and numerous
   TGF-beta and NF-kappa B/TNF pathway genes were alternatively methylated
   between subgroups. Contrary, DNA methylation over time was deemed rather
   stable with few recurrent changes noted within subgroups. Although a
   larger number of non-recurrent changes were identified among
   IGHV-unmutated relative to mutated cases over time, these equated to a
   low global change. Similarly, few changes were identified between
   compartment cases. Altogether, we reveal CLL subgroups to display unique
   methylation profiles and unveil methylation as relatively stable over
   time and similar within different CLL compartments, implying aberrant
   methylation as an early leukemogenic event. Leukemia (2013) 27, 150-158;

TI Triage of cervical cytological diagnoses of atypical squamous cells by
   DNA methylation of paired boxed gene 1 (PAX1)
SO DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Detection of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)
   in patients with equivocal cytological abnormalities, such as atypical
   squamous cells (ASC) of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or inability
   to exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASC-H) is still
   a challenge. This study tested the efficacy of PAX1 methylation analysis
   in the triage of cervical ASCUS and ASC-H and compared its performance
   with Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV test. A hospital-based casecontrol study
   was conducted. Cervical scrapings from patients with ASCUS or ASC-H were
   used for the quantitative methylation analysis of PAX1 methylation by
   MethyLight and HPV testing by HC2. Patients with ASC-H or ASCUS with
   repeated abnormal smears underwent colposcopic biopsy and subsequent
   therapies. Diagnoses were made by histopathology at a follow-up of 2
   years. The efficacies of detecting high-grade lesions were compared.
   Fifty-eight cervical scrapings with cytological diagnosis of ASCUS (n =
   41) and ASC-H (n = 17) were analyzed. One of the 41 (2.4%) ASCUS
   patients and seven of 17 (41.2%) ASC-H patients were confirmed to have
   HSIL. After dichotomy of the PMR, PAX1 methylation rates were
   significantly higher in ASC developing HSIL compared with those
   developing reactive atypia (87.5% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001). Testing PAX1
   methylation in cervical swabs of patients with ASC confers better
   sensitivity (87.5% vs. 62.5%) and specificity (98.0% vs. 86.0%) than HC2
   HPV testing. We show for the first time that PAX1 hypermethylation
   analysis may be a better choice than HC2 in the triage of ASCUS and
   ASC-H. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Structural Basis of a Histone H3 Lysine 4 Demethylase Required for Stem
   Elongation in Rice
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Histone lysine methylation is an important epigenetic modification in
   regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone H3 lysine 4
   methylation (H3K4me), which can be in a mono-, di-, or trimethylated
   state, has been shown to play an important role in gene expression
   involved in plant developmental control and stress adaptation. However,
   the resetting mechanism of this epigenetic modification is not yet fully
   understood. In this work, we identified a JmjC domain-containing
   protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically
   reverses all three forms of H3K4me in rice. Loss-of-function mutation of
   the gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related
   to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant.
   Analysis of crystal structure of the catalytic core domain (c-JMJ703) of
   the protein revealed a general structural similarity with mammalian and
   yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However,
   several specific features were observed in the structure of c-JMJ703.
   Key residues that interact with cofactors Fe(II) and N-oxalylglycine and
   the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide were identified and were shown to
   be essential for the demethylase activity in vivo. Several key residues
   are specifically conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that
   they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation.

TI Helicobacter pylori Causes Epigenetic Dysregulation of FOXD3 to Promote
   Gastric Carcinogenesis
SO GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Deregulation of forkhead box (Fox) proteins, an
   evolutionarily conserved family of transcriptional regulators, leads to
   tumorigenesis. Little is known about their regulation or functions in
   the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Promoter hypermethylation occurs
   during Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis. We investigated whether
   the deregulated genes contribute to gastric tumorigenesis. METHODS: We
   used integrative genome-wide scans to identify concomitant
   hypermethylated genes in mice infected with H pylori and human gastric
   cancer samples. We also analyzed epigenetic gene silencing in gastric
   tissues from patients with H pylori infection and gastritis, intestinal
   metaplasia, gastric tumors, or without disease (controls). Target genes
   were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation microarrays and
   expression and luciferase reporter analyses. RESULTS: Methylation
   profile analyses identified the promoter of FOXD3 as the only genomic
   region with increased methylation in mice and humans during progression
   of H pylori-associated gastric tumors. FOXD3 methylation also correlated
   with shorter survival times of patients with gastric cancer. Genome
   demethylation reactivated FOXD3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines.
   Transgenic overexpression of FOXD3 significantly inhibited gastric
   cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and reduced growth of xenograft
   tumors in mice, at least partially, by promoting tumor cell apoptosis.
   FOXD3 bound directly to the promoters of, and activated transcription
   of, genes encoding the cell death regulators CYFIP2 and RARB. Levels of
   FOXD3, CYFIP2, and RARB messenger RNAs were reduced in human gastric
   tumor samples, compared with control tissues. CONCLUSIONS:
   FOXD3-mediated transcriptional control of tumor suppressors is
   deregulated by H pylori infection-induced hypermethylation; this could
   perturb the balance between cell death and survival. These findings
   identify a pathway by which epigenetic changes affect gastric tumor
   suppression.

TI Characterization of the prostate cancer susceptibility gene KLF6 in
   human and mouse prostate cancers
SO PROSTATE
AB BACKGROUND Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 6 is a candidate tumor suppressor
   gene in prostate cancer, but the mechanisms contributing to its loss of
   expression are poorly understood. We characterized KLF6 expression and
   DNA methylation status during prostate tumorigenesis in humans and mice.
   METHODS KLF6 expression was assessed in matched human non-malignant (NM)
   and tumor prostate tissues (n?=?22) by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
   and in three independent human prostate cancer cohorts
   bioinformatically. QPCR for KLF6 expression and methylation-sensitive
   PCR (MSP) were performed in human prostate LNCaP cancer cells after
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. Klf6 protein levels and DNA promoter
   methylation were assessed in TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate
   (TRAMP) tumors by immunohistochemistry and MSP, respectively.
   RESULTS KLF6 splice variants expression was increased (P?=?0.0015) in
   human prostate tumors compared to NM tissues. Overall, KLF6 was
   decreased in metastatic compared to primary prostate cancers and reduced
   expression in primary tumors was associated with a shorter time to
   relapse (P?=?0.0028). Treatment with the demethylating agent
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in up-regulation of KLF6 expression
   (two-fold; P?=?0.002) and a decrease in DNA methylation of the KLF6
   promoter in LNCaP cells. Klf6 protein levels significantly decreased
   with progression in the TRAMP model of prostate cancer (P?<?0.05), but
   there was no difference in Klf6 promoter methylation.
   CONCLUSION KLF6 expression was decreased in both clinical prostate
   cancer and the TRAMP model with disease progression, but this could not
   be explained by DNA methylation of the KLF6 promoter. Prostate 73:

TI Drosophila LSD1-CoREST demethylase complex regulates DPP/TGF beta
   signaling during wing development
SO GENESIS
AB The choice and timing of specific developmental pathways in
   organogenesis are determined by tissue-specific temporal and spatial
   cues that are acted upon to impart unique cellular and compartmental
   identities. A consequence of cellular signaling is the rapid
   transcriptional reprogramming of a wide variety of target genes. To
   overcome intrinsic epigenetic chromatin barriers to transcription
   modulation, histone modifying and remodeling complexes are employed. The
   deposition or erasure of specific covalent histone modifications,
   including acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination are essential
   features of gene activation and repression. We have found that the
   activity of a specific class of histone demethylation enzymes is
   required for the specification of vein cell fates during Drosophila wing
   development. Genetic tests revealed that the Drosophila LSD1-CoREST
   complex is required for proper cell specification through regulation of
   the DPP/TGF beta pathway. An important finding from this analysis is
   that LSD1-CoREST functions through control of rhomboid expression in an
   EGFR-independent pathway. genesis 51:1631, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley

TI Aberration in DNA Methylation in B-Cell Lymphomas Has a Complex Origin
   and Increases with Disease Severity
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Despite mounting evidence that epigenetic abnormalities play a key role
   in cancer biology, their contributions to the malignant phenotype remain
   poorly understood. Here we studied genome-wide DNA methylation in normal
   B-cell populations and subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma:
   follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. These lymphomas
   display striking and progressive intra-tumor heterogeneity and also
   inter-patient heterogeneity in their cytosine methylation patterns.
   Epigenetic heterogeneity is initiated in normal germinal center B-cells,
   increases markedly with disease aggressiveness, and is associated with
   unfavorable clinical outcome. Moreover, patterns of abnormal methylation
   vary depending upon chromosomal regions, gene density and the status of
   neighboring genes. DNA methylation abnormalities arise via two distinct
   processes: i) lymphomagenic transcriptional regulators perturb promoter
   DNA methylation in a target gene-specific manner, and ii) aberrant
   epigenetic states tend to spread to neighboring promoters in the absence
   of CTCF insulator binding sites.

TI Genome-wide profiling of bone reveals differentially methylated regions
   in osteoporosis and osteoarthritis
SO ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM
AB Objective To determine genome-wide methylation profiles of bone from
   patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and those with osteoporotic (OP)
   hip fractures. Methods Trabecular bone pieces were obtained from the
   central part of the femoral head of 27 patients with hip fractures and
   26 patients with hip OA. DNA was isolated, and methylation was explored
   with Illumina methylation arrays. RNA was extracted, pooled, and
   deep-sequenced to obtain the whole transcriptome. Differentially
   methylated regions were identified, and connections between genes with
   differentially methylated regions were explored by pathway and
   text-mining analyses. Results After quality control, methylation of
   23,367 CpG sites (13,463 genes) was analyzed. There was a genome-wide
   inverse relationship between methylation and gene expression in both
   patient groups. Comparison of OP and OA bones revealed 241 CpG sites,
   located in 228 genes, with significant differences in methylation (false
   discovery rate <0.05). Of them, 217 were less methylated in OP than in
   OA. The absolute methylation differences were >5% in 128 CpG sites and
   >10% in 45 CpG sites. The differentially methylated genes were enriched
   for association with bone traits in the genome-wide association study
   catalog. Pathway analysis and text-mining analysis with Gene
   Relationships Across Implicated Loci software revealed enrichment in
   genes participating in glycoprotein metabolism or cell differentiation,
   and particularly in the homeobox superfamily of transcription factors.
   Conclusion Genome-wide methylation profiling of bone samples revealed
   differentially methylated regions in OP and OA. These regions were
   enriched in genes associated with cell differentiation and skeletal
   embryogenesis, such as those in the homeobox superfamily, suggesting the
   existence of a developmental component in the predisposition to these
   disorders.

TI Global transcriptional analysis of nuclear reprogramming in the
   transition from MEFs to iPSCs
SO GENES TO CELLS
AB Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are flourishing in the
   investigation of cell reprogramming. However, we still know little about
   the sequential molecular mechanism during somatic cell reprogramming
   (SCR). Here, we first observed rapid generation of colonies whereas
   mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were induced by OCT4, SOX2, KLF4
   (OSK), and vitamin C for 7 days. The colony's global transcriptional
   profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix microarray. Microarray data
   confirmed that SCR was a process in which transcriptome got reversed and
   pluripotent genes expressed de novo. There were many changes, especially
   substantial growth expression of epigenetic factors, on transcriptome
   during the transition from Day 7 to iPSCs indicating that this period
   may provide 'flexibility' genome structure, chromatin remodeling, and
   epigenetic modifications to rebind to the transcriptional factors.
   Several biological processes such as viral immune response, apoptosis,
   cell fate specification, and cell communication were mainly involved
   before Day 7 whereas cell cycle, DNA methylation, and histone
   modification were mainly involved after Day 7. Furthermore, it was
   suggested that p53 signaling contributed to the transition 'hyperdynamic
   plastic' cell state and assembled cell niche for SCR, and small
   molecular compounds useful for chromatin remodeling can enhance iPSCs by
   exciting epigenetic modification rather than the exogenous expression of
   more TFs vectors.

TI Investigating the effects of the presence of foreign DNA on DNA
   methylation and DNA repair events in cultured eukaryotic cells
SO GENE
AB Methylation of DNA in eukaryotic cells, global as well as gene-specific,
   is affected by endogenous and endogenous factors. In this paper, it is
   reported that deviations in DNA methylation and expression of genes
   involved in DNA repair and the cell cycle are affected in 143B cultured
   cells containing an expression vector. Global DNA methylation analysis
   with cytosine-extension assay revealed a decreased global DNA
   methylation in the presence of the expression vector. Less
   promoter-specific methylation, as measured by bisulfite-MS PCR, was
   observed for MGMT and p16INK4a in vector-containing cells. Comet assay
   investigations revealed a negative effect on the DNA repair capacity of
   both BER and NER in Complex III compromised cells. This was reflected in
   the down-regulation of hOGG1 and ERCC1 expression. The results presented
   in this paper support the existence of a strong relationship between
   impaired mitochondrial function and deviations in DNA methylation and
   extend this relationship to impaired DNA repair. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantitative profiling of CpG island methylation in human stool for
   colorectal cancer detection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB The aims of this study were to investigate the use of quantitative CGI
   methylation data from stool DNA to classify colon cancer patients and to
   relate stool CGI methylation levels to those found in corresponding
   tissue samples.
   We applied a quantitative methylation-specific PCR assay to determine
   CGI methylation levels of six genes, previously shown to be aberrantly
   methylated during colorectal carcinogenesis. Assays were performed on
   DNA from biopsies of "normal" mucosa and stool samples from 57 patients
   classified as disease-free, adenoma, or cancer by endoscopy, and in
   tumour tissue from cancer patients. Additionally, CGI methylation was
   analysed in stool DNA from an asymptomatic population of individuals
   covering a broad age range (mean = 47 +/- 24 years)
   CGI methylation levels in stool DNA were significantly higher than in
   DNA from macroscopically normal mucosa, and a significant correlation
   between stool and mucosa was observed for ESR1 only. Multivariate
   statistical analyses using the methylation levels of each CGI in stool
   DNA as a continuous variable revealed a highly significant (p = 0.003)
   classification of cancer vs. non-cancer (adenoma + disease-free)
   patients (sensitivity = 65 %, specificity = 81 %).
   CGI methylation profiling of stool DNA successfully identified patients
   with cancer despite the methylation status of CGIs in stool DNA not
   generally reflecting those in DNA from the colonic mucosa.

TI Antiepileptic drugs and the fetal epigenome
SO EPILEPSIA
AB Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can lower maternal folate and increase
   maternal homocysteine levels, which are known to affect the methyl cycle
   and hence DNA methylation levels. The influence of in utero exposure to
   AEDs on fetal DNA methylation was investigated. Genome-wide fetal
   epigenomic profiles were determined using the Infinium 27K BeadArray
   from Illumina (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The Infinium array measures
   approximately 27,000 CpG loci associated with 14,496 genes at
   single-nucleotide resolution. Eighteen cord blood samples (nine samples
   from babies exposed to AEDs and nine controls) from otherwise
   uncomplicated pregnancies were compared. Unsupervised hierarchic
   clustering was used to compare the calculated methylation profiles. A
   clear distinction between the methylation profiles of samples from
   babies exposed to AEDs in utero compared with controls was detected.
   These data provide evidence of an epigenetic effect associated with
   antenatal AED and high-dose folate supplementation during pregnancy. The
   differences in fetal DNA methylation of those exposed to AEDs shows that
   a genome-wide effect of methylation is evident. In addition, the
   epigenetic changes observed appear to be, in this limited sample,
   independent of extremes of birth weight centiles. These preliminary data
   highlight possible mechanisms by which AEDs might influence fetal
   outcomes and the potential of optimizing AED-specific folate
   supplementation regimens to offset these effects.

TI Acute restraint stress prevents nicotine-induced mesolimbic dopaminergic
   activation via a corticosterone-mediated mechanism: A microdialysis
   study in the rat
SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB Background: Stress affects the responsiveness to nicotine (NIC), by
   increasing drug use, facilitating relapse and reinstating NIC self
   administration even after prolonged abstinence. In turn, high
   corticosterone (CURT) blood levels induced by stress may alter the
   neurobiological properties of NIC by acting on the dopamine (DA)
   mesolimbic system.
   Methods: In this study, we evaluated the effect of exposure to acute
   restraint stress on NIC-induced stimulation of the mesolimbic DA system
   of the rat, by studying extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens
   shell (NAccs) with microdialysis.
   Results: NIC intravenous administration (130 mu g/kg) increased DA
   levels in the NAccs in control rats but not in subjects exposed to
   stress; this latter phenomenon was prevented by blockade of CURT effects
   with the inhibitor of corticosterone synthesis metirapone (100 mg/Kg) or
   the glucorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone (150 mu mol/kg).
   Conclusions: These observations show that exposure to acute stress
   inhibits the stimulatory response of the mesolimbic DA system to NIC and
   suggest that this effect is mediated by circulating CURT acting on its
   receptors. These results may bear relevance in explaining the role
   played by stressful stimuli in NIC-seeking and taking behavior. (C) 2012

TI DNA methylation silences miR-132 in prostate cancer
SO ONCOGENE
AB Silencing of microRNAs (miRNAs) by promoter CpG island methylation may
   be an important mechanism in prostate carcinogenesis. To screen for
   epigenetically silenced miRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa), we treated
   prostate normal epithelial and carcinoma cells with
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) and subsequently examined expression
   changes of 650 miRNAs by megaplex stemloop reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR. After applying a selection strategy, we
   analyzed the methylation status of CpG islands upstream to a subset of
   miRNAs by methylation-specific PCR. The CpG islands of miR-18b, miR-132,
   miR-34b/c, miR-148a, miR-450a and miR-542-3p showed methylation patterns
   congruent with their expression modulations in response to AZA.
   Methylation analysis of these CpG islands in a panel of 50 human
   prostate carcinoma specimens and 24 normal controls revealed miR-132 to
   be methylated in 42% of human cancer cases in a manner positively
   correlated to total Gleason score and tumor stage. Expression analysis
   of miR-132 in our tissue panel confirmed its downregulation in
   methylated tumors. Re-expression of miR-132 in PC3 cells induced cell
   detachment followed by cell death (anoikis). Two pro-survival
   proteins-heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and TALIN2-were
   confirmed as direct targets of miR-132. The results of this study point
   to miR-132 as a methylation-silenced miRNA with an antimetastatic role
   in PCa controlling cellular adhesion. Oncogene (2013) 32, 127-134;

TI Sexual Dimorphism of Thyroid Reactive Oxygen Species Production Due to
   Higher NADPH Oxidase 4 Expression in Female Thyroid Glands
SO THYROID
AB Background: Dual oxidases (DUOX1 and DUOX2) are NADPH oxidases (NOX)
   involved in hydrogen peroxide production necessary for thyroid
   hormonogenesis, but recently, the NOX4 has also been described in the
   thyroid gland. The prevalence of thyroid disease is higher in women, and
   the basis for this difference might involve a higher oxidative stress
   level in the female thyroid gland. Hence, we aimed at evaluating whether
   the function and the expression of enzymes involved in the thyroid redox
   balance differ between females and males.
   Methods: DUOX1, DUOX2, NOX4, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase
   activities and expression levels were evaluated in the thyroids of
   prepubertal and adult male and female rats. The mRNA levels of DUOXA1
   and DUOXA2, the DUOX maturation factors, and of p22phox and Poldip2
   (subunits of NOX4) were also determined.
   Results: A higher calcium-independent H(2)O(2) production was detected
   in the adult female rat thyroid, being higher in the estrous phase of
   the cycle. Moreover, the expression of NOX4 and Poldip2 mRNA was higher
   in the thyroids of adult female rats, as well as in PCCL3 cells treated
   with 17 beta-estradiol. The GPx1 mRNA expression was higher in adult
   female thyroids, while GPx2 and GPx3 mRNA and total GPx activity were
   not significantly different. Catalase mRNA expression and activity,
   together with thyroid thiol levels were significantly lower in the adult
   female rat thyroid.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our results show that the thyroid gland of
   female rats is exposed to higher oxidative stress levels due both to
   increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through NOX4, and
   decreased ROS degradation.

TI Paramutagenicity of a p1 epiallele in maize
SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
AB Complex silencing mechanisms in plants and other kingdoms target
   transposons, repeat sequences, invasive viral nucleic acids and
   transgenes, but also endogenous genes and genes involved in
   paramutation. Paramutation occurs in a heterozygote when a
   transcriptionally active allele heritably adopts the epigenetic state of
   a transcriptionally and/or post-transcriptionally repressed allele.
   P1-rr and its silenced epiallele P1-pr, which encode a Myb-like
   transcription factor mediating pigmentation in floral organs of Zea
   mays, differ in their cytosine methylation pattern and chromatin
   structure at a complex enhancer site. Here, we tested whether P1-pr is
   able to heritably silence its transcriptionally active P1-rr allele in a
   heterozygote and whether DNA methylation is associated with the
   establishment and maintenance of P1-rr silencing. We found that P1-pr
   participates in paramutation as the repressing allele and P1-rr as the
   sensitive allele. Silencing of P1-rr is highly variable compared to the
   inducing P1-pr resulting in a wide range of gene expression. Whereas
   cytosine methylation at P1-rr is negatively correlated with
   transcription and pigment levels after segregation of P1-pr, methylation
   lags behind the establishment of the repressed p1 gene expression. We
   propose a model in which P1-pr paramutation is triggered by changing
   epigenetic states of transposons immediately adjacent to a P1-rr
   enhancer sequence. Considering the vast amount of transposable elements
   in the maize genome close to regulatory elements of genes, numerous loci
   could undergo paramutation-induced allele silencing, which could also
   have a significant impact on breeding agronomically important traits.

TI Multilayered chromatin analysis reveals E2f, Smad and Zfx as
   transcriptional regulators of histones
SO NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Histones, the building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, are essential for
   genome packaging, function and regulation. However, little is known
   about their transcriptional regulation. Here we conducted a
   comprehensive computational analysis, based on chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-sequencing and -microarray analysis (ChIP-seq and
   ChIP-chip) data of over 50 transcription factors and histone
   modifications in mouse embryonic stem cells. Enrichment scores supported
   by gene expression data from gene knockout studies identified E2f1 and
   E2f4 as master regulators of histone genes, CTCF and Zfx as repressors
   of core and linker histones, respectively, and Smad1, Smad2, YY1 and
   Ep300 as restricted or cell type-specific regulators. We propose that
   histone gene regulation is substantially more complex than previously
   thought, and that a combination of factors orchestrate histone gene
   regulation, from strict synchronization with S phase to targeted
   regulation of specific histone subtypes.

TI Shaping chromatin for repair
SO MUTATION RESEARCH-REVIEWS IN MUTATION RESEARCH
AB To counteract the adverse effects of various DNA lesions, cells have
   evolved an array of diverse repair pathways to restore DNA structure and
   to coordinate repair with cell cycle regulation. Chromatin changes are
   an integral part of the DNA damage response, particularly with regard to
   the types of repair that involve assembly of large multiprotein
   complexes such as those involved in double strand break (DSB) repair and
   nucleotide excision repair (NER). A number of phosphorylation,
   acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation and chromatin remodeling events
   modulate chromatin structure at the lesion site. These changes demarcate
   chromatin neighboring the lesion, afford accessibility and binding
   surfaces to repair factors and provide on-the-spot means to coordinate
   repair and damage signaling. Thus, the hierarchical assembly of repair
   factors at a double strand break is mostly due to their regulated
   interactions with posttranslational modifications of histones. A large
   number of chromatin remodelers are required at different stages of DSB
   repair and NER. Remodelers physically interact with proteins involved in
   repair processes, suggesting that chromatin remodeling is a requisite
   for repair factors to access the damaged site. Together, recent findings
   define the roles of histone post-translational modifications and
   chromatin remodeling in the DNA damage response and underscore possible
   differences in the requirements for these events in relation to the
   chromatin context. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Dynamics of DNA Methylation in Schizophrenia and Related Psychiatric
   Disorders
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar
   disorder (BP) with psychosis (BP+) express a complex symptomatology
   characterized by positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive
   impairment. Postmortem studies of human SZ and BP+ brains show
   considerable alterations in the transcriptome of a variety of cortical
   structures, including multiple mRNAs that are downregulated in both
   inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory pyramidal neurons compared with
   non-psychiatric subjects (NPS). Several reports show increased
   expression of DNA methyltransferases in telencephalic GABAergic neurons.
   Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role for altered DNA
   methylation processes in the pathogenesis of SZ and related psychiatric
   disorders. The establishment and maintenance of CpG site methylation is
   essential during central nervous system differentiation and this
   methylation has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning, and
   memory. Atypical hypermethylation of candidate gene promoters expressed
   in GABAergic neurons is associated with transcriptional downregulation
   of the corresponding mRNAs, including glutamic acid decarboxylase 67
   (GAD67) and reelin (RELN). Recent reports indicate that the methylation
   status of promoter proximal CpG dinucleotides is in a dynamic balance
   between DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation. Hydroxymethylation
   and subsequent DNA demethylation is more complex and involves additional
   proteins downstream of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, including members of the
   base excision repair (BER) pathway. Recent advances in our understanding
   of altered CpG methylation, hydroxymethylation, and active DNA
   demethylation provide a framework for the identification of new targets,
   which may be exploited for the pharmacological intervention of the
   psychosis associated with SZ and possibly BP+. Neuropsychopharmacology

TI Effects of light deficiency on genome methylation in Posidonia oceanica
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Growth and distribution of seagrasses is closely related to undersea
   light quality and intensity. Currently, several factors linked to
   anthropogenic pressure, such as increased sediment runoff, resuspension
   of bottom sediments, and algae accumulations, reduce sub-surface light
   availability in most Mediterranean coastal areas, and are causing a
   general regression of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadows. We
   investigated whether plant capacity to adapt to light deficiency could
   be related to a repatterning of genome methylation in a natural
   population of P. oceanica subjected to low-light conditions. DNA
   methylation status was analyzed in shoot apical meristems and leaves of
   plants growing in a disturbed meadow, characterized by reduced light
   availability, versus plants growing in a preserved meadow. Two
   complementary approaches were applied, viz. the methylation-sensitive
   amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique and immuno cytological
   detection of methylated sites on interphase nuclei. Genome
   hypermethylation was detected in the organs of plants growing at the
   disturbed site, indicating that de novo methylation occurred under
   light-related stress conditions. MSAP analysis revealed that changes in
   methylation status involved specific classes of genes with various
   functions, including light perception and harvesting genes such as
   PoPHYB and LHCB5. It is likely that epigenetic regulation of these 2
   genes through methylation plays a role in the resistance and resilience
   of P. oceanica plants to critical light conditions. We propose that the
   status of genome methylation is a promising diagnostic tool for early
   detection of stress factors affecting P. oceanica meadows.

TI Folate in pregnancy and imprinted gene and repeat element methylation in
   the offspring
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB Background: Epigenetic regulation of imprinted genes and transposable
   elements has been implicated in human disease and may be affected by
   maternal diet.
   Objective: The objective was to determine the effect on offspring
   epigenetic status of nutritional and genetic factors that influence
   folate exposure in pregnancy.
   Design: We measured folate intake from diet, the use of folic acid
   supplements and the period of consumption, maternal and cord red blood
   cell (RBC) folate, and genotypes for 5 methylation cycle enzymes in a
   prospective cohort study of pregnancies in the United Kingdom between
   2000 and 2006. We related these to offspring methylation status within 3
   maternally methylated imprinted genes: paternally expressed gene 3
   (PEG3), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and small nuclear
   ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N, and the long interspersed nuclear
   element 1 (LINE-1) in genomic DNA extracted from whole blood in 913
   pregnancies.
   Results: Supplement use after 12 wk of gestation was associated with a
   higher level of methylation in IGF2 (+0.7%; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.4; P =
   0.044) and reduced methylation in both PEG3 (-0.5%; 95% CI: -0.9, -0.1;
   P = 0.018) and LINE-1 (-0.3%; 95% CI: -0.6, -0.04; P = 0.029). The same
   pattern was observed in relation to RBC folate in the cord blood at
   birth: IGF2 (P = 0.038), PEG3 (P < 0.001), and LINE-1 (P < 0.001).
   LINE-1 methylation was related to maternal RBC folate (P = 0.001) at 19
   wk. No effect of supplement use up to 12 wk (current recommendation) was
   found.
   Conclusions: Folic acid use after 12 wk of gestation influences
   offspring repeat element and imprinted gene methylation. We need to
   understand the consequences of these epigenetic effects. Am J Clin Nutr

TI A focal domain of extreme demethylation within D4Z4 in FSHD2
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Objective: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a
   neuromuscular disease with an unclear genetic mechanism. Most patients
   have a contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array at 4qter,
   which is thought to cause partial demethylation (FSHD1) of the
   contracted allele. Demethylation has been surveyed at 3 restriction
   enzyme sites in the first repeat and only a single site across the
   entire array, and current models postulate that a generalized D4Z4
   chromatin alteration causes FSHD. The background of normal alleles has
   confounded the study of epigenetic alterations; however, rare patients
   (FSHD2) have a form of the disease in which demethylation is global,
   i.e., on all D4Z4 elements throughout the genome. Our objective was to
   take advantage of the global nature of FSHD2 to identify where
   disease-relevant methylation changes occur within D4Z4.
   Methods: Using bisulfite sequencing of DNA from blood and myoblast
   cells, methylation levels at 74 CpG sites across 3 disparate regions
   within D4Z4 were measured in FSHD2 patients and controls.
   Results: We found that rates of demethylation caused by FSHD2 are not
   consistent across D4Z4. We identified a focal region of extreme
   demethylation within a 59 domain, which we named DR1. Other D4Z4
   regions, including the DUX4 ORF, were hypomethylated but to a much
   lesser extent.
   Conclusions: These data challenge the simple view that FSHD is caused by
   a broad "opening" of D4Z4 and lead us to postulate that the region of
   focal demethylation is the site of action of the key D4Z4 chromatin
   regulatory factors that go awry in FSHD. Neurology (R) 2013;80:392-399

TI Utilization of lysine (13)C-methylation NMR for protein-protein
   interaction studies
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR NMR
AB Chemical modification is an easy way for stable isotope labeling of
   non-labeled proteins. The reductive (13)C-methylation of the amino group
   of the lysine side-chain by (13)C-formaldehyde is a post-modification
   and is applicable to most proteins since this chemical modification
   specifically and quickly proceeds under mild conditions such as 4 A
   degrees C, pH 6.8, overnight. (13)C-methylation has been used for NMR to
   study the interactions between the methylated proteins and various
   molecules, such as small ligands, nucleic acids and peptides. Here we
   applied lysine (13)C-methylation NMR to monitor protein-protein
   interactions. The affinity and the intermolecular interaction sites of
   methylated ubiquitin with three ubiquitin-interacting proteins were
   successfully determined using chemical-shift perturbation experiments
   via the (1)H-(13)C HSQC spectra of the (13)C-methylated-lysine methyl
   groups. The lysine (13)C-methylation NMR results also emphasized the
   importance of the usage of side-chain signals to monitor the
   intermolecular interaction sites, and was applicable to studying samples
   with concentrations in the low sub-micromolar range.

TI Identification of differentially methylated regions during vernalization
   revealed a role for RNA methyltransferases in bolting
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris altissima) is a biennial root crop with an
   absolute requirement for cold exposure to bolt and flower, a process
   called vernalization. Global DNA methylation variations have been
   reported during vernalization in several plants. However, few genes
   targeted by DNA methylation during vernalization have been described.
   The objectives of this study were to identify differentially methylated
   regions and to study their involvement in bolting induction and
   tolerance. Restriction landmark genome scanning was applied to DNA from
   shoot apical meristems of sugar beet genotypes, providing a direct
   quantitative epigenetic assessment of several CG methylated genes
   without prior knowledge of gene sequence. Several differentially
   methylated regions exhibiting variations of gene-body DNA methylation
   and expression during cold exposure and/or between genotypes were
   identified, including an AROGENATE DEHYDRATASE and two RNA
   METHYLCYTOSINE TRANSFERASE sequences. One RNA METHYLCYTOSINE TRANSFERASE
   sequence displayed gene-body hypermethylation and activation of
   expression, while the other was hypomethylated and inhibited by cold
   exposure. Global RNA methylation and phenolic compound levels changed
   during cold exposure in a genotype-dependent way. The use of methyl RNA
   immunoprecipitation of total RNA and reverse transcriptionPCR analysis
   revealed mRNA methylation in a vernalized bolting-resistant genotype for
   the FLOWERING LOCUS 1 gene, a repressor of flowering. Finally,
   Arabidopsis mutants for RNA METHYLCYTOSINE TRANSFERASE and AROGENATE
   DEHYDRATASE were shown to exhibit, under different environmental
   conditions, early or late bolting phenotypes, respectively. Overall, the
   data identified functional targets of DNA methylation during
   vernalization in sugar beet, and it is proposed that RNA methylation and
   phenolic compounds play a role in the floral transition.

TI Epigenetics in the Human Brain
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Many cellular constituents in the human brain permanently exit from the
   cell cycle during pre- or early postnatal development, but little is
   known about epigenetic regulation of neuronal and glial epigenomes
   during maturation and aging, including changes in mood and psychosis
   spectrum disorders and other cognitive or emotional disease. Here, we
   summarize the current knowledge base as it pertains to genome
   organization in the human brain, including the regulation of DNA
   cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation, and a subset of (altogether
   4100) residue-specific histone modifications associated with gene
   expression, and silencing and various other functional chromatin states.
   We propose that high-resolution mapping of epigenetic markings in
   postmortem brain tissue or neural cultures derived from induced
   pluripotent cells (iPS), in conjunction with transcriptome profiling and
   whole-genome sequencing, will increasingly be used to define the
   molecular pathology of specific cases diagnosed with depression,
   schizophrenia, autism, or other major psychiatric disease. We predict
   that these highly integrative explorations of genome organization and
   function will provide an important alternative to conventional
   approaches in human brain studies, which mainly are aimed at uncovering
   group effects by diagnosis but generally face limitations because of
   cohort size. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews (2013) 38, 183-197; doi:

TI Broad-complex functions in postembryonic development of the cockroach
   Blattella germanica shed new light on the evolution of insect
   metamorphosis
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS
AB Background: Insect metamorphosis proceeds in two modes: hemimetaboly,
   gradual change along the life cycle; and holometaboly, abrupt change
   from larvae to adult mediated by a pupal stage. Both are regulated by
   20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which promotes molts, and juvenile hormone
   (JH), which represses adult morphogenesis. Expression of Broad-complex
   (BR-C) is induced by 20E and modulated by JH. In holometabolous species,
   like Drosophila melanogaster, BR-C expression is inhibited by JH in
   young larvae and enhanced in mature larvae, when JH declines and BR-C
   expression specifies the pupal stage.
   Methods: Using Blattella germanica as a basal hemimetabolous model, we
   determined the patterns of expression of BR-C mRNAs using quantitative
   RT-PCR, and we studied the functions of BR-C factors using RNA
   interference approaches.
   Results: We found that BR-C expression is enhanced by JH and correlates
   with JH hemolymph concentration. BR-C factors appear to be involved in
   cell division and wing pad growth, as well as wing vein patterning.
   Conclusions: In B. germanica, expression of BR-C is enhanced by JH, and
   BR-C factors appear to promote wing growth to reach the right size, form
   and patterning, which contrast with the endocrine regulation and complex
   functions observed in holometabolous species.
   General significance: Our results shed new light to the evolution from
   hemimetaboly to holometaboly regarding BR-C, whose regulation and
   functions were affected by two innovations: 1) a shift in JH action on
   BR-C expression during young stages, from stimulatory to inhibitory, and
   2) an expansion of functions, from regulating wing development, to
   determining pupal morphogenesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Epigenetic Mechanisms in Stroke and Epilepsy
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Epigenetic remodeling and modifications of chromatin structure by DNA
   methylation and histone modifications represent central mechanisms for
   the regulation of neuronal gene expression during brain development,
   higher-order processing, and memory formation. Emerging evidence
   implicates epigenetic modifications not only in normal brain function,
   but also in neuropsychiatric disorders. This review focuses on recent
   findings that disruption of chromatin modifications have a major role in
   the neurodegeneration associated with ischemic stroke and epilepsy.
   Although these disorders differ in their underlying causes and
   pathophysiology, they share a common feature, in that each disorder
   activates the gene silencing transcription factor REST (repressor
   element 1 silencing transcription factor), which orchestrates epigenetic
   remodeling of a subset of 'transcriptionally responsive targets'
   implicated in neuronal death. Although ischemic insults activate REST in
   selectively vulnerable neurons in the hippocampal CA1, seizures activate
   REST in CA3 neurons destined to die. Profiling the array of genes that
   are epigenetically dysregulated in response to neuronal insults is
   likely to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
   pathophysiology of these disorders and may lead to the identification of
   novel therapeutic strategies for the amelioration of these serious human
   conditions. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews (2013) 38, 167-182;

TI Accumulation and loss of asymmetric non-CpG methylation during male
   germ-cell development
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB DNA methylation is a well-characterized epigenetic modification involved
   in gene regulation and transposon silencing in mammals. It mainly occurs
   on cytosines at CpG sites but methylation at non-CpG sites is frequently
   observed in embryonic stem cells, induced pluriotent stem cells, oocytes
   and the brain. The biological significance of non-CpG methylation is
   unknown. Here, we show that non-CpG methylation is also present in male
   germ cells, within and around B1 retrotransposon sequences interspersed
   in the mouse genome. It accumulates in mitotically arrested fetal
   prospermatogonia and reaches the highest level by birth in a
   Dnmt3l-dependent manner. The preferential site of non-CpG methylation is
   CpA, especially CpApG and CpApC. Although CpApG (and CpTpG) sites
   contain cytosines at symmetrical positions, hairpin-bisulfite sequencing
   reveals that they are hemimethylated, suggesting the absence of a
   template-dependent copying mechanism. Indeed, the level of non-CpG
   methylation decreases after the resumption of mitosis in the neonatal
   period, whereas that of CpG methylation does not. The cells eventually
   lose non-CpG methylation by the time they become spermatogonia. Our
   results show that non-CpG methylation accumulates in non-replicating,
   arrested cells but is not maintained in mitotically dividing cells
   during male germ-cell development.

TI DNA Methylation and Histone Modification Profiles of Mouse Organic Anion
   Transporting Polypeptides
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB Organic anion transporting polypeptides (rodents, Oatps; human, OATPs)
   are primarily involved in the transmembrane transportation of a wide
   range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Multiple mouse Oatp1
   isoforms are closely located on chromosome 6, where each isoform shows
   distinct tissue distribution; Oatp1b2, Oatp1a6, and Oatp1c1 are
   expressed exclusively in the liver, kidney, and cerebrum, respectively;
   Oatp1a1 in the liver and kidney; and Oatp1a4 in the liver and cerebrum.
   We have identified tissue-dependent differentially methylated region
   (T-DMR) around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of Oatp1b2, which
   correlates with its liver-specific expression. Bisulfite sequencing also
   demonstrated the presence of T-DMRs around the TSS in other Oatp1 genes:
   CpG dinucleotides at +149 relative to the TSS for Oatp1c1; -48, +101,
   and +356 for Oatp1a4; -572 and -550 for Oatp1a1; and -122 and +216 for
   Oatp1a6 were differentially methylated among the liver, kidney, and
   cerebrum. These methylation profiles were largely consistent with the
   tissue distribution of Oatp1 mRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
   revealed that the mRNA expression of Oatp1 genes was accompanied by
   acetylated histone H3. Human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are located on
   chromosome 12p12 in the OATP1 cluster; both show predominant expression
   in the liver. These genes also contained T-DMRs that were hypomethylated
   in the liver, compared with kidney cortex: -511, -411, and +92 relative
   to the TSS for OATP1B1 and -331, +70, and +73 for OATP1B3. These results
   suggest that the difference in epigenetic profiles comprising DNA
   methylation and histone acetylation determines the distinct tissue
   distribution of Oatp/OATP mRNAs.

TI Impact of Altered Methylation in Cytokine Signaling and Proteasome
   Function in Alcohol and Viral-Mediated Diseases
SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Data from several laboratories have shown that ethanol (EtOH) feeding
   impairs many essential methylation reactions that contribute to
   alcoholic liver disease (ALD). EtOH is also a comorbid factor in the
   severity of hepatitis C virusinduced liver injury. The presence of viral
   proteins further exacerbates the methylation defects to disrupt multiple
   pathways that promote the pathogenesis of liver disease. This review is
   a compilation of presentations that linked the methylation reaction
   defects with proteasome inhibition, decreased antigen presentation, and
   impaired interferon (IFN) signaling in the hepatocytes and dysregulated
   TNFa expression in macrophages. Two therapeutic modalities, betaine and
   S-adenosylmethionine, can correct methylation defects to attenuate many
   EtOH-induced liver changes, as well as improve IFN signaling pathways,
   thereby overcoming viral treatment resistance.

TI The Prevalence and Features of Thyroid Pyramidal Lobe, Accessory
   Thyroid, and Ectopic Thyroid as Assessed by Computed Tomography: A
   Multicenter Study
SO THYROID
AB Background and Purpose: Understanding the computed tomography (CT)
   characteristics of the pyramidal lobe and other thyroid variations and
   detecting them accurately using preoperative neck CT will minimize
   unnecessary remnant thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy in patients
   with thyroid cancer. The purpose of the present study was to assess the
   frequency, location, and size of the pyramidal lobe and other thyroid
   variations using a large-scaled, multicenter study.
   Methods: Neck CT scans for 200 patients were selected from 11
   institutions; a total of 2200 patients were included in the study. The
   patients underwent neck CT for the following reasons: trauma, known
   thyroid malignancy, cervical lymphadenopathy, palpable neck mass,
   oropharyngolaryngeal malignancy, vocal cord palsy, postchemotherapy CT
   follow-up, inflammatory or infectious neck lesion, parathyroid
   abnormality, and patient request. A single radiologist at each
   institution retrospectively analyzed 200 neck CT scans. Each radiologist
   investigated the presence, location, length, volume, and upper end of
   the pyramidal lobe and its separation or continuity with the main
   thyroid gland as well as the presence, location, length, and volume of
   the accessory or ectopic thyroid using a picture archiving and
   communication system.
   Results: A pyramidal lobe was present in 44.6% (981/2200) of the
   patients. The prevalence for the pyramidal lobe at the participating
   institutions ranged from 28.0% to 55.0% (mean, 44.6%). Pyramidal lobes
   originating from the left side of the thyroid were most common, and the
   number of pyramidal lobes showing separation from the main thyroid gland
   was 90 (9.2%). The mean anteroposterior diameter, transverse diameter,
   and length of the pyramidal lobe were 2.3, 5.9, and 20.8 mm,
   respectively. Among both men and women, the most common level of the
   upper end of the pyramidal lobes was the thyroid cartilage, but there
   was a significant difference in the frequency of the pyramidal lobe
   between males and females (p < 0.0001). The rate of the pyramidal lobe
   detection in the 2-mm-slice-thickness group was higher than those in the
   2.5- and 3-mm groups (p = 0.0003).
   Conclusion: Neck CT is useful for detecting the presence, size,
   configuration, and location of the pyramidal lobe and other thyroid
   variations.

TI Targeted Inactivation of HDAC2 Restores p16(INK4a) Activity and Exerts
   Antitumor Effects on Human Gastric Cancer
SO MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH
AB Aberrant regulation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) was reported for
   gastric cancers. However, responsive cancer genes in disease onset and
   progression are less understood. HDAC2 expression was studied by
   quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The functional consequences of
   HDAC2 knockdown on cell-cycle regulation, programmed cell death, and
   gene target identification was investigated by flow cytometry, Western
   blotting, electron microscopy, anchorage-independent colony formation,
   and cell migration assay and by whole-genome microarray. Therapeutic
   efficacy of HDAC2 knockdown was determined in nude mice with small
   hairpin expressing human gastric cancer cells. Epigenetic regulation of
   p16(INK4a) was studied by methylation-specific PCR and chromatin-IP to
   evidence HDAC2 or acetylated-histone-H4 binding at gene specific
   promoter sequences. HDAC2 gene and protein expression was significantly
   upregulated in different histopathologic grades of human gastric cancers
   and cancer cell lines. HDAC2 inactivation significantly reduced cell
   motility, cell invasion, clonal expansion, and tumor growth. HDAC2
   knockdown-induced G(1)-S cell cycle arrest and restored activity of
   p16(INK4a) and the proapoptotic factors. This treatment caused PARP
   cleavage and hypophosphorylation of the Rb-protein, repressed cyclinD1,
   CDK4, and Bcl-2 expression and induced autophagic phenotype, that is,
   LC3B-II conversion. Some gastric tumors and cancer cells displayed
   p16(INK4a) promoter hypermethylation but treatment with
   5-aza-deoxycitidine restored activity. With others the methylation
   status was unchanged. Here, chromatin-IP evidenced HDAC2 binding.
   Nonetheless, expression of p16(INK4a) was restored by HDAC2 knockdown
   with notable histone-H4-acetylation, as determined by chromatin-IP.
   Thus, p16(INK4a) is regulated by HDAC2. HDAC2 is a bona fide target for
   novel molecular therapies in gastric cancers. Mol Cancer Res; 11(1);

TI Reactivation of the Silenced Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta Gene
   Expression Delays Thyroid Tumor Progression
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB That a knock-in mouse harboring a dominant-negative thyroid hormone
   receptor (TR)-beta (Thrb) mutation develops metastatic thyroid cancer
   strongly suggests the involvement of TR beta in carcinogenesis.
   Epigenetic silencing of the THRB gene is common in human cancers. The
   aim of the present study was to determine how DNA methylation affected
   the expression of the THRB gene in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)
   and how reexpression of the THRB gene attenuated the cancer phenotypes.
   We used methylation-specific PCR to examine the expression and promoter
   methylation of the THRB gene in DTC tissues. Thyroid cancer cells with
   hypermethylated THRB were treated with the demethylating agents
   5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-aza-CdR) and zebularine to evaluate their
   impact on the cancer cell phenotypes. THRB mRNA expression in DTC was
   90% lower than in normal controls, and this decrease was associated with
   a higher tumor/lymph node staging. The promoter methylation level of the
   THRB gene had a significant negative correlation with the expression
   level of the THRB gene. Treatment of FTC-236 cells with 5'-aza-CdR or
   zebularine induced reexpression of the THRB gene and inhibited cell
   proliferation and migration. FTC-236 cells stably expressing TR beta
   exhibited lower cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of
   beta-catenin signaling pathways compared with FTC-236 without TR beta.
   5'-Aza-CdR also led to suppression of tumor growth in an in vivo
   xenograft model using FTC-236 cells consistent with the cell-based
   studies. These finding indicate that TR beta is a tumor suppressor and
   could be tested as a potential therapeutic target. (Endocrinology 154:

TI Chronic exposure to an extremely low-frequency magnetic field induces
   depression-like behavior and corticosterone secretion without
   enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in mice
SO BIOELECTROMAGNETICS
AB An extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) is generated by power
   lines and household electrical devices. Many studies have suggested an
   association between chronic ELF-MF exposure and anxiety and/or
   depression. The mechanism of these effects is assumed to be a stress
   response induced by ELF-MF exposure. However, this mechanism remains
   controversial. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic
   ELF-MF exposure (intensity, 3?mT; total exposure, 200?h) affected
   emotional behavior and corticosterone synthesis in mice. ELF-MF-treated
   mice showed a significant increase in total immobility time in a forced
   swim test and showed latency to enter the light box in a lightdark
   transition test, compared with sham-treated (control) mice.
   Corticosterone secretion was significantly high in the ELF-MF-exposed
   mice; however, no changes were observed in the amount of the
   adrenocorticotropic hormone and the expression of genes related to
   stress response. Quantification of the mRNA levels of adrenal
   corticosteroid synthesis enzymes revealed a significant reduction in
   Cyp17a1 mRNA in the ELF-MF-exposed mice. Our findings suggest the
   possibility that high intensity and chronic exposure to ELF-MF induces
   an increase in corticosterone secretion, along with depression- and/or
   anxiety-like behavior, without enhancement of the
   hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis. Bioelectromagnetics 34:4351, 2013.

TI High prevalence of epigenetic inactivation of the human four and a half
   LIM domains 1 gene in human oral cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB The four and a half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) gene has been related to
   carcinogenesis. However, the expression status of FHL1 in human oral
   squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear and the detailed
   mechanism of gene silencing is poorly understood. The aim of this study
   was to examine the FHL1 expression level and its regulatory mechanism in
   OSCCs. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) and western blotting showed significant downregulation of FHL1 in
   all OSCC-derived cell lines (Sa3, HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, HO-1-u-1,
   HO-1-N-1, KON and Ca9-22) compared to human normal oral keratinocytcs.
   We also found that FHL1 mRNA expression was frequently downregulated
   (P<0.01) in 51 (86.4%) of 59 primary OSCCs compared with the
   corresponding normal oral tissues, while there was no significant
   difference between the status of the FHL1 protein expression in OSCCs
   and the clinicopathological features. Using methylation-specific PCR, we
   detected methylated FHL1 in all cell lines and treatment with the DNA
   methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored the FHL1
   expression. However, no significant restoration of FHL1 expression was
   observed using sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase and
   chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that histone H3 lysine 9 in the
   FHL1 promoter region was significantly acetylated. In addition, no
   mutation in the entire coding region of the FHL1 gene was found.
   Therefore, our data suggested that inactivation of the FHL1 gene is a
   frequent event during oral carcinogenesis and that the mechanism of FHL1
   downregulation in OSCCs is through DNA methylation of the promoter
   region rather than histone deacetylation or mutation.

TI Prenatal zinc deficiency-dependent epigenetic alterations of mouse
   metallothionein-2 gene
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Zinc (Zn) deficiency in utero has been shown to cause a variety of
   disease states in children in developing countries, which prompted us to
   formulate the hypothesis that fetal epigenetic alterations are induced
   by zinc deficiency in utero. Focusing on metallothionein (MT), a protein
   that contributes to Zn transport and homeostasis, we studied whether and
   how the prenatal Zn status affects gene expression. Pregnant mice were
   fed low-Zn (IU-LZ, 5.0 mu g Zn/g) or control (IU-CZ, 35 mu g Zn/g) diet
   ad libitum from gestation day 8 until delivery, with a regular diet
   thereafter. Bisulfite genomic sequencing for DNA methylation and
   chromatin immunoprecipitation assay for histone modifications were
   performed on the MT2 promoter region. We found that 5-week-old IU-LZ
   mice administered cadmium (Cd) (5.0 mg/kg b.w.) have an elevated
   abundance of MT2 mRNA compared with IU-CZ mice. Alteration of histone
   modifications in the MT2 promoter region having metal responsive
   elements (MREs) was observed in 1-day-old and 5-week-old IU-LZ mice
   compared with IU-CZ mice. In addition, prolongation of MTF1 binding to
   the MT2 promoter region in 5-week-old IU-LZ mice upon Cd exposure is
   considered to contribute to the enhanced MT2 induction. In conclusion,
   we found for the first time that Zn deficiency in utero induces fetal
   epigenetic alterations and that these changes are being stored as an
   epigenetic memory until adulthood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-like genes are frequently
   hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
AB The activity of phosphatases could be influenced by genetic, as well as
   epigenetic alterations. In our study, we have investigated the
   methylation status of four PTPRs: PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRR and PTPRZ1, which
   were pre-selected using microarray techniques as being alternatively
   methylated in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). The analyses were
   carried out on 131 surgical specimens obtained from sporadic CRC
   patients. The methylation status of the four genes was examined using
   methyl specific PCR (MSP). The analysis of promoter methylation using an
   Illumina 27K microarray revealed four protein tyrosine phosphatases
   PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRR and PTPRZ1 as being hypermethylated with beta-value
   >= 0.2 and P <= 0.05. Subsequent analysis using MSP confirmed these
   observations-the frequency of promoter methylation was significantly
   higher in tumor cells compared with matched normal tissue for each of
   the analyzed genes. There was no association observed between the
   methylation status of PTPRs and either CIMP, K-ras (codon 12) and BRAF
   (exon 15, V600E) mutations or tumor localization (proximal/ distal). The
   results of our study show a statistically significant difference between
   promoter methylation in cancerous and healthy tissue. This result
   supports the hypothesis that the PTPR family has an important role in
   the etiology of CRC. Journal of Human Genetics (2013) 58, 11-15;

TI Methylome of DNase I sensitive chromatin in Populus trichocarpa shoot
   apical meristematic cells: a simplified approach revealing
   characteristics of gene-body DNA methylation in open chromatin state
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB DNA methylation is involved in the control of plant development and
   adaptation to the environment through modifications of chromatin
   compaction and gene expression. In poplar (Populus trichocarpa), a
   perennial plant, variations in DNA methylation have been reported
   between genotypes and tissues or in response to drought. Nevertheless,
   the relationships between gene-body DNA methylation, gene expression and
   chromatin compaction still need clarification.
   Here, DNA methylation was mapped in the noncondensed chromatin fraction
   from P. trichocarpa shoot apical meristematic cells, the center of plant
   morphogenesis, where DNA methylation variations could influence the
   developmental trajectory. DNase I was used to isolate the noncondensed
   chromatin fraction. Methylated sequences were immunoprecipitated,
   sequenced using Illumina/Solexa technology and mapped on the v2.0 poplar
   genome. Bisulfite sequencing of candidate sequences was used to confirm
   mapping data and to assess cytosine contexts and methylation levels.
   While the methylated DNase I hypersensitive site fraction covered 1.9%
   of the poplar genome, it contained sequences corresponding to 74% of
   poplar gene models, mostly exons. The level and cytosine context of
   gene-body DNA methylation varied with the structural characteristics of
   the genes.
   Taken together, our data show that DNA methylation is widespread and
   variable among genes in open chromatin of meristematic cells, in
   agreement with a role in their developmental trajectory.

TI Deiodinase Activities in Thyroids and Tissues of Iodine-Deficient Female
   Rats
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Severe iodine deficiency is characterized by goiter, preferential
   synthesis, and secretion of T(3) in thyroids, hypothyroxinemia in plasma
   and tissues, normal or low plasma T(3), and slightly increased plasma
   TSH. We studied changes in deiodinase activities and mRNA in several
   tissues of rats maintained on low-iodine diets (LIDs) or LIDs
   supplemented with iodine (LID+I). T(4) and T(3) concentrations decreased
   in plasma, tissues, and thyroids of LID rats, and T(4) decreased more
   than T(3) (50%). The highest type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (D1)
   activities were found in the thyroid, kidney, and the liver; pituitary,
   lung, and ovary had lower D1 activities; but the lowest levels were
   found in the heart and skeletal muscle. D1 activity decreased in all
   tissues of LID rats (10-40% of LID+I rats), except for ovary and
   thyroids, which D1 activity increased 2.5-fold. Maximal type 2
   iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) activities were found in thyroid, brown
   adipose tissue, and pituitary, increasing 6.5-fold in thyroids of LID
   rats and about 20-fold in the whole gland. D2 always increased in
   response to LID, and maximal increases were found in the cerebral cortex
   (19-fold), thyroid, brown adipose tissue, and pituitary (6-fold). Lower
   D2 activities were found in the ovary, heart, and adrenal gland, which
   increased in LID. Type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase activity was
   undetectable. Thyroidal Dio1 and Dio2 mRNA increased in the LID rats,
   and Dio1 decreased in the lung, with no changes in mRNA expression in
   other tissues. Our data indicate that LID induces changes in deiodinase
   activities, especially in the thyroid, to counteract the low T(4)
   synthesis and secretion, contributing to maintain the local T(3)
   concentrations in the tissues with D2 activity. (Endocrinology 154:

TI Steroid hormone levels in calling males and males practicing alternative
   non-calling mating tactics in the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea
SO HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB Circulating glucocorticoids and androgens often figure prominently in
   mating tactic expression in vertebrates. In anuran amphibians (frogs and
   toads), for example, recent models predict that the depletion of energy
   reserves during vocalization will result in increased glucocorticoid
   levels; high glucocorticoids are expected to negatively affect androgen
   level to mediate transitions from calling to non-calling behavior.
   Consistent with these predictions, we show that male green treefrogs
   (Hyla cinerea) adopting an alternative non-calling "satellite" mating
   tactic were in poorer condition and had higher circulating
   corticosterone levels and lower androgen levels than calling males. Body
   condition was inversely related to corticosterone level and positively
   related to testosterone, but not dihydrotestosterone, level.
   Corticosterone level was inversely related to testosterone level but not
   dihydrotestosterone level. Lastly, we show that calling males that were
   involved in aggressive bouts had higher corticosterone levels than
   calling males that were not involved in aggressive bouts. Our results
   are thus consistent with the prediction that aggressive interactions
   with conspecific males contribute to high corticosterone levels in
   satellite males that were observed to lose aggressive contests with
   larger calling males. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Corticosterone stress response of Greater Rhea (Rhea americana) during
   short-term road transport
SO POULTRY SCIENCE
AB The effect of transport stress on blood corticosterone levels in captive
   Greater Rheas was investigated. Twelve adult individuals (7 males; 5
   females) were loaded in pairs inside wooden crates and transported along
   a paved road for 30 min. Blood samples were taken before the individuals
   were introduced into the crate (baseline value) and immediately after
   they were unloaded (30 min after capture). To assess whether
   corticosterone levels were affected by the blood sampling procedure per
   se, another 6 (nontransport) control birds (3 males; 3 females) were
   also captured and sampled at the same times as their transported
   counterparts. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were measured using a
   commercially available corticosterone 1251 radio-immunoassay kit.
   Baseline corticosterone levels were similar in the control and
   transported birds (9.0 +/- 1.6 and 10.4 +/- 0.8 ng/mL, respectively).
   Transportation induced a highly significant (P < 0.001), more than
   40-fold increase in the corticosterone levels (433.6 +/- 35.4 ng/mL)
   that was about 5 times higher (P < 0.001) than in their nontransported
   counterparts (88.4 +/- 14.8 ng/mL). The present findings suggest that
   Greater Rhea is a species highly sensitive to stressful manipulations.
   Both blood sampling and transportation induced highly significant
   adrenocortical responses. Considering that transportation is one of the
   unavoidable common practices in the management of Greater Rheas and, as
   shown in the present study, that it induces a significant 40-fold
   corticosterone stress response, efforts should focus on helping to
   generate management transport standards for optimization of the welfare
   of this ratite.

TI Changes in Histone Modification and DNA Methylation of the StAR and
   Cyp19a1 Promoter Regions in Granulosa Cells Undergoing Luteinization
   during Ovulation In Rats
SO ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The ovulatory LH surge induces rapid up-regulation of steroidogenic
   acute regulatory (StAR) protein and rapid down-regulation of aromatase
   (Cyp19a1) in granulosa cells (GCs) undergoing luteinization during
   ovulation. This study investigated in vivo whether epigenetic mechanisms
   including histone modifications are involved in the rapid changes of
   StAR and Cyp19a1 gene expression. GCs were obtained from rats treated
   with equine chorionic gonadotropin (CG) before (0 h) and after human (h)
   CG injection. StAR mRNA levels rapidly increased after hCG injection,
   reached a peak at 4h, and then remained higher compared with 0h until 12
   h. Cyp19a1 mRNA levels gradually decreased after hCG injection and
   reached their lowest level at 12 h. A chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assay revealed that levels of histone-H4 acetylation (Ac-H4) and
   trimethylation of histone-H3 lysine-4 (H3K4me3) increased whereas
   H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 decreased in the StAR promoter after hCG injection.
   On the other hand, the levels of Ac-H3 and -H4 and H3K4me3 decreased,
   and H3K27me3 increased in the Cyp19a1 promoter after hCG injection.
   Chromatin condensation, which was analyzed using deoxyribonuclease I,
   decreased in the StAR promoter and increased in the Cyp19a1 promoter
   after hCG injection. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay also showed
   that binding activities of CAATT/enhancer-binding protein beta to the
   StAR promoter increased and binding activities of phosphorylated-cAMP
   response element binding protein to the Cyp19a1 promoter decreased after
   hCG injection. These results provide in vivo evidence that histone
   modifications are involved in the rapid changes of StAR and Cyp19a1 gene
   expression by altering chromatin structure of the promoters in GCs
   undergoing luteinization during ovulation. (Endocrinology 154: 458-470,

TI Genome-wide profiling in melatonin-exposed human breast cancer cell
   lines identifies differentially methylated genes involved in the
   anticancer effect of melatonin
SO JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH
AB Epigenetic alterations have emerged as an important mechanism involved
   in tumorigenesis. The epigenetic impact of DNA methylation in various
   types of human cancer is not completely understood. Previously, we
   observed melatonin-induced differential expression of miRNA and
   miRNA-related genes in human breast cancer cell lines that indicated an
   anticancer effect of melatonin. In this report, we further characterized
   epigenetic changes in melatonin-exposed MCF-7 cells through the analysis
   of DNA methylation profiles in breast cancer cells to provide new
   insights into the potential mechanisms of the anticancer effect of
   melatonin. Microarray-based DNA methylation and gene expression
   profiling were carried out using human breast cancer cell lines. We
   further identified a number of mRNAs whose expression levels show an
   inverse correlation with DNA methylation levels. The mRNA expression
   levels and methylation status of candidate genes in melatonin-exposed
   cells were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and bisulfite PCR.
   This approach led to the detection of cancer-related genes, which were
   oncogenic genes, including EGR3 and POU4F2/Brn-3b were down-regulated,
   while the tumor suppressor gene, GPC3, was up-regulated by 1 nM
   melatonin-treated MCF-7 cells. Our results provide detailed insights
   into the DNA methylation patterns induced by melatonin and suggest a
   potential mechanism of the anticancer effect of aberrant DNA methylation
   in melatonin-treated breast cancer cells.

TI Developmental Plasticity of Endocrine Disorders in Obesity Model Primed
   by Early Weaning in Dams
SO HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH
AB Early weaning is associated with changes in the developmental
   plasticity. Here, we studied the adipocytes morphology, adipokines
   expression or content in adipose tissue as well as adrenal and thyroid
   function of neonate and adult offspring primed by early weaning. After
   birth, lactating rats were divided into 2 groups: EW (early weaning) -
   dams were wrapped with a bandage to block access to milk during the last
   3 days of lactation, and Control - dams whose pups had free access to
   milk throughout lactation (21 days). At postnatal day (PN) 21, EW pups
   had lower visceral and subcutaneous adipocyte area (-67.7% and -62%,
   respectively), body fat mass (-26%), and leptin expression in visceral
   adipocyte (-64%) but higher leptin expression in subcutaneous adipocyte
   (2.9-fold increase). Adrenal evaluations were normal, but neonate EW
   pups presented lower serum T3 (-55%) and TSH (-44%). At PN 180, EW off
   spring showed higher food intake, higher body fat mass(+21.6%), visceral
   and subcutaneous adipocyte area (both 3-fold increase), higher leptin
   (+95%) and ADR beta 3 (2-fold increase) content in visceral adipose
   tissue, and higher adiponectin expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue
   (+47%) but lower in visceral adipose tissue(-40%). Adult EW off spring
   presented higher adrenal catecholamine content(+31%), but no changes in
   serum corticosterone or thyroid status. Thus, early weaning primed for
   hypothyroidism at weaning, which can be associated with the adipocyte
   hypertrophy at adulthood. The marked changes in catecholamine adrenal
   content and visceral adipocyte ADRB3 are generally found in obesity,
   contributing to the development of other cardiovascular and metabolic
   disturbances.

TI Integrative analysis of chromatin states in Arabidopsis identified
   potential regulatory mechanisms for natural antisense transcript
   production
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB Genome-wide analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles provide
   extensive resources for discovering epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.
   However, the construction of functionally relevant hypotheses from
   correlative patterns and the rigorous testing of these hypotheses may be
   challenging. We combined bioinformatics-driven hypothesis building with
   mutant analyses to identify potential epigenetic mechanisms using the
   model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Genome-wide maps of nine histone
   modifications produced by ChIP-seq were used together with a
   strand-specific RNA-seq dataset to profile the epigenome and
   transcriptome of Arabidopsis. Combinatorial chromatin patterns were
   described by 42 major chromatin states with selected states validated
   using the re-ChIP assay. The functional relevance of chromatin
   modifications was analyzed using the ANchored CORrelative Pattern
   (ANCORP) method and a newly developed state-specific effects analysis
   (SSEA) method, which interrogates individual chromatin marks in the
   context of combinatorial chromatin states. Based on results from these
   approaches, we propose the hypothesis that cytosine methylation (5mC)
   and histone methylation H3K36me may synergistically repress production
   of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in the context of actively
   expressed genes. Mutant analyses supported this proposed model at a
   significant proportion of the tested loci. We further identified
   polymerase-associated factor as a potential repressor for NAT abundance.
   Although the majority of tested NATs were found to localize to the
   nucleus, we also found evidence for cytoplasmically partitioned NATs.
   The significance of the subcellular localization of NATs and their
   biological functions remain to be defined.

TI Minicircle DNA Vectors Achieve Sustained Expression Reflected by Active
   Chromatin and Transcriptional Level
SO MOLECULAR THERAPY
AB Current efforts in nonviral gene therapy are plagued by a pervasive
   difficulty in sustaining therapeutic levels of delivered transgenes.
   Minicircles (plasmid derivatives with the same expression cassette but
   lacking a bacterial backbone) show sustained expression and hold promise
   for therapeutic use where persistent transgene expression is required.
   To characterize the widely-observed silencing process affecting
   expression of foreign DNA in mammals, we used a system in which mouse
   liver presented with either plasmid or minicircle consistently silences
   plasmid but not minicircle expression. We found that preferential
   silencing of plasmid DNA occurs at a nuclear stage that precedes
   transport of mRNA to the cytoplasm, evident from a consistent >25-fold
   minicircle/plasmid transcript difference observed in both nuclear and
   total RNA. Among possible mechanisms of nuclear silencing, our data
   favor chromatin-linked transcriptional blockage rather than targeted
   degradation, aberrant processing, or compromised mRNA transport. In
   particular, we observe dramatic enrichment of H3K27 trimethylation on
   plasmid sequences. Also, it appears that Pol II can engage the modified
   plasmid chromatin, potentially in a manner that is not productive in the
   synthesis of high levels of new transcript. We outline a scenario in
   which sustained differences at the chromatin level cooperate to
   determine the activity of foreign DNA.

TI DNA Methylation and Its Basic Function
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB In the mammalian genome, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism
   involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5 position of the
   cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. DNA methylation regulates gene
   expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by
   inhibiting the binding of transcription factor(s) to DNA. During
   development, the pattern of DNA methylation in the genome changes as a
   result of a dynamic process involving both de novo DNA methylation and
   demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a stable
   and unique DNA methylation pattern that regulates tissue-specific gene
   transcription. In this chapter, we will review the process of DNA
   methylation and demethylation in the nervous system. We will describe
   the DNA (de) methylation machinery and its association with other
   epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and noncoding RNAs.
   Intriguingly, postmitotic neurons still express DNA methyltransferases
   and components involved in DNA demethylation. Moreover, neuronal
   activity can modulate their pattern of DNA methylation in response to
   physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise regulation of DNA
   methylation is essential for normal cognitive function. Indeed, when DNA
   methylation is altered as a result of developmental mutations or
   environmental risk factors, such as drug exposure and neural injury,
   mental impairment is a common side effect. The investigation into DNA
   methylation continues to show a rich and complex picture about
   epigenetic gene regulation in the central nervous system and provides
   possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric
   disorders. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews (2013) 38, 23-38;

TI Are baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses in
   free-living amphibians repeatable?
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Amphibians respond to environmental stressors by secreting
   corticosterone, a stress hormone which promotes physiological and
   behavioral responses. Capture handling can be used to stimulate
   physiological stress response in amphibians. The use of single blood
   sampling and presentation of mean data often limits the quantification
   of within and between individual variation in baseline and short-term
   corticosterone stress responses in amphibians. It is important for
   studies of amphibian physiological ecology to determine whether baseline
   and short-term corticosterone stress responses are consistent or not. We
   quantified repeatability (r), a statistical measure of consistency, in
   baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses to a standard
   capture and handling stress protocol in free-living adult male cane
   toads (Rhinella marina). Corticosterone metabolite concentrations were
   measured entirely non-invasively in male toad urine samples via an
   enzyme-immunoassay. During the first sampling occasion, urine samples
   were collected manually from individual male toads (n = 20) immediately
   upon field capture. Toads were handled for 5 min then transferred to
   plastic bags (constituting a mild stressor), and urine samples were
   collected hourly over 8 h in the field. The toads were resampled for
   baseline (0 h) urine corticosterone with hourly urine sampling over 8 h
   (for quantification of the stress induced corticosterone) at 14 day
   intervals on three consecutive occasions. Within and between sample
   variations in urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations were also
   quantified. All toads expressed a corticosterone stress response over 8
   h to our standard capture and handling stress protocol. Variations both
   within and between toads was higher for corrected integrated
   corticosterone concentrations than corticosterone concentrations at
   baseline, 3 or 6 h. Baseline urinary corticosterone metabolite
   concentration of the male toads was highly repeatable (r = 0.877)
   together with high statistical repeatabilities for 3 h (r = 0.695), 6 h
   (r = 0.428) and 8 h (r = 0.775) corticosterone metabolite
   concentrations, and for the total and corrected integrated
   corticosterone responses (r = 0.807: r = 0.743 respectively). This study
   highlights that baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses
   are repeatable in free-living amphibians. Future studies should utilize
   this non-invasive tool to explore repeatability among seasons and across
   years, and determine its functional significance in relation to
   behavioral ecology and reproduction in amphibians generally. (C) 2012

TI Glucose as a fetal nutrient: dynamic regulation of several glucose
   transporter genes by DNA methylation in the human placenta across
   gestation
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The human placenta ensures proper fetal development through the
   regulation of nutrient and gas transfer from the mother to the fetus and
   the removal of waste products from the fetal circulation. Glucose is one
   of the major nutrients for the growing fetus. Its transport across the
   placenta to the fetus is mediated by a family of facilitative
   transporter proteins, known as the glucose transporters (GLUTs), encoded
   by the SLC2A family of genes. There are 14 members of this gene family,
   and the expression of several of these has been shown in human placenta;
   however, aside from GLUT1 and GLUT3, little is known about the role of
   these proteins in placental function, fetal development and disease. In
   this study, we analysed previously generated genome-scale DNA
   methylation and gene expression data to examine the role of methylation
   in GLUT expression throughout gestation. We found evidence that DNA
   methylation regulates expression of GLUT3 and GLUT10, while the
   constitutively expressed GLUT1 showed no promoter methylation. We
   further analysed the level of DNA methylation across the promoter region
   of GLUT3, previously shown to be involved in glucose back-flux from the
   fetal circulation into the placenta. Using the Sequenom EpiTYPER
   platform, we found increasing DNA methylation of this gene in
   association with decreasing expression as gestation progresses, thereby
   highlighting the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating the GLUT
   family of genes in the placenta during pregnancy. These findings warrant
   a reexamination of the role of additional GLUT family members in the
   placenta in pregnancy and disease. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

TI Prospective Study of Family History and Colorectal Cancer Risk by Tumor
   LINE-1 Methylation Level
SO JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
AB Background Beyond known familial colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes, the
   mechanisms underlying the elevated CRC risk associated with CRC family
   history remain largely unknown. A recent retrospective study suggests
   familial clustering of CRC with hypomethylation in long interspersed
   nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1). We tested the hypothesis that CRC family
   history might confer a higher risk of LINE-1 methylation-low CRC.
   Methods Using the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals
   Follow-up Study, we prospectively examined the association between CRC
   family history and the risk of rectal and colon cancer (N = 1224)
   according to tumor LINE-1 methylation level by duplication method Cox
   proportional hazards regression. We examined microsatellite instability
   (MSI) status to exclude the influence of Lynch syndrome. All statistical
   tests were two-sided.
   Results The association between CRC family history and non-MSI CRC risk
   differed statistically significantly by LINE-1 methylation level
   (P(heterogeneity) = .02). CRC family history was associated with a
   statistically significantly higher risk of LINE-1 methylation-low
   non-MSI cancer (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 1.68, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 1.19 to 2.38 for 1 vs 0 first-degree relatives with CRC;
   multivariable HR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.59 to 7.6 for = 2 vs 0 first-degree
   relatives with CRC; P(trend) < .001). In contrast, CRC family history
   was not statistically significantly associated with LINE-1
   methylation-high non-MSI cancer (P(trend) = .35).
   Conclusions This molecular pathological epidemiology study shows that
   CRC family history is associated with a higher risk of LINE-1
   methylation-low CRC, suggesting previously unrecognized heritable
   predisposition to epigenetic alterations. Additional studies are needed
   to evaluate tumor LINE-1 methylation as a molecular biomarker for
   familial cancer risk assessment. J Natl Cancer Inst 2013;105:130-140

TI Differential gene body methylation and reduced expression of cell
   adhesion and neurotransmitter receptor genes in adverse maternal
   environment
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Early life adversity, including adverse gestational and postpartum
   maternal environment, is a contributing factor in the development of
   autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and
   depression but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism.
   In a model of gestational maternal adversity that leads to innate
   anxiety, increased stress reactivity and impaired vocal communication in
   the offspring, we asked if a specific DNA methylation signature is
   associated with the emergence of the behavioral phenotype. Genome-wide
   DNA methylation analyses identified 2.3% of CpGs as differentially
   methylated (that is, differentially methylated sites, DMSs) by the
   adverse environment in ventral-hippocampal granule cells, neurons that
   can be linked to the anxiety phenotype. DMSs were typically clustered
   and these clusters were preferentially located at gene bodies. Although
   CpGs are typically either highly methylated or unmethylated, DMSs had an
   intermediate (20-80%) methylation level that may contribute to their
   sensitivity to environmental adversity. The adverse maternal environment
   resulted in either hyper or hypomethylation at DMSs. Clusters of DMSs
   were enriched in genes that encode cell adhesion molecules and
   neurotransmitter receptors; some of which were also downregulated,
   indicating multiple functional deficits at the synapse in adversity.
   Pharmacological and genetic evidence links many of these genes to
   anxiety. Translational Psychiatry (2013) 3, e218;

TI Dot1-Dependent Histone H3K79 Methylation Promotes Activation of the Mek1
   Meiotic Checkpoint Effector Kinase by Regulating the Hop1 Adaptor
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB During meiosis, accurate chromosome segregation relies on the proper
   interaction between homologous chromosomes, including synapsis and
   recombination. The meiotic recombination checkpoint is a quality control
   mechanism that monitors those crucial events. In response to defects in
   synapsis and/or recombination, this checkpoint blocks or delays
   progression of meiosis, preventing the formation of aberrant gametes.
   Meiotic recombination occurs in the context of chromatin and histone
   modifications, which play crucial roles in the maintenance of genomic
   integrity. Here, we unveil the role of Dot1-dependent histone H3
   methylation at lysine 79 (H3K79me) in this meiotic surveillance
   mechanism. We demonstrate that the meiotic checkpoint function of Dot1
   relies on H3K79me because, like the dot1 deletion, H3-K79A or H3-K79R
   mutations suppress the checkpoint-imposed meiotic delay of a
   synapsis-defective zip1 mutant. Moreover, by genetically manipulating
   Dot1 catalytic activity, we find that the status of H3K79me modulates
   the meiotic checkpoint response. We also define the phosphorylation
   events involving activation of the meiotic checkpoint effector Mek1
   kinase. Dot1 is required for Mek1 autophosphorylation, but not for its
   Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation. Dot1-dependent H3K79me also
   promotes Hop1 activation and its proper distribution along zip1 meiotic
   chromosomes, at least in part, by regulating Pch2 localization.
   Furthermore, HOP1 overexpression bypasses the Dot1 requirement for
   checkpoint activation. We propose that chromatin remodeling resulting
   from unrepaired meiotic DSBs and/or faulty interhomolog interactions
   allows Dot1-mediated H3K79me to exclude Pch2 from the chromosomes, thus
   driving localization of Hop1 along chromosome axes and enabling Mek1
   full activation to trigger downstream responses, such as meiotic arrest.

TI NonO Binds to the CpG Island of oct4 Promoter and Functions as a
   Transcriptional Activator of oct4 Gene Expression
SO MOLECULES AND CELLS
AB We investigated the relationship between oct4 gene expression patterns
   and CpG sites methylation profiles during ES cell differentiation into
   neurons, and identified relevant binding factor. The oct4 gene
   expression level gradually declined as ES cell differentiation
   progressed, and the CpG sites in the oct4 proximal enhancer (PE) and
   promoter regions were methylated in concert with ES cell
   differentiation. An electro-mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that
   putative proteins bind to CpG sites in the oct4 PE/promoter. We purified
   CpG binding proteins with DNA-binding purification method, and NonO was
   identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. EMSA with
   specific competitors revealed that NonO specifically binds to the
   conserved CCGGTGAC sequence in the oct4 promoter. Methylation at a
   specific cytosine residue (CC*GGTGAC) reduced the binding affinity of
   NonO for the recognition sequence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
   analysis confirmed that NonO binds to the unmethylated oct4 promoter.
   There were no changes in the NonO mRNA and protein levels between ES
   cells and differentiated cells. The transcriptional role of NonO in oct4
   gene expression was evaluated by luciferase assays and knockdown
   experiments. The luciferase activity significantly increased threefold
   when the NonO expression vector was co-transfected with the NonO
   recognition sequence, indicating that NonO has a transcription activator
   effect on oct4 gene expression. In accordance with this effect, when
   NonO expression was inhibited by siRNA treatment, oct4 expression was
   also significantly reduced. In summary, we purified NonO, a novel
   protein that binds to the CpG island of oct4 promoter, and positively
   regulates oct4 gene expression in ES cells.

TI Yeast Rrp8p, a novel methyltransferase responsible for m(1)A 645 base
   modification of 25S rRNA
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Ribosomal RNA undergoes various modifications to optimize ribosomal
   structure and expand the topological potential of RNA. The most common
   nucleotide modifications in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are pseudouridylations
   and 2'-O methylations (Nm), performed by H/ACA box snoRNAs and C/D box
   snoRNAs, respectively. Furthermore, rRNAs of both ribosomal subunits
   also contain various base modifications, which are catalysed by specific
   enzymes. These modifications cluster in highly conserved areas of the
   ribosome. Although most enzymes catalysing 18S rRNA base modifications
   have been identified, little is known about the 25S rRNA base
   modifications. The m(1)A modification at position 645 in Helix 25.1 is
   highly conserved in eukaryotes. Helix formation in this region of the
   25S rRNA might be a prerequisite for a correct topological framework for
   5.8S rRNA to interact with 25S rRNA. Surprisingly, we have identified
   ribosomal RNA processing protein 8 (Rrp8), a nucleolar Rossman-fold like
   methyltransferase, to carry out the m(1)A base modification at position
   645, although Rrp8 was previously shown to be involved in A2 cleavage
   and 40S biogenesis. In addition, we were able to identify specific point
   mutations in Rrp8, which show that a reduced S-adenosyl-methionine
   binding influences the quality of the 60S subunit. This highlights the
   dual functionality of Rrp8 in the biogenesis of both subunits.

TI Histone Deacetylase Inhibition Activates Transgene Expression from
   Integration-Defective Lentiviral Vectors in Dividing and Non-Dividing
   Cells
SO HUMAN GENE THERAPY
AB Integration-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) are being increasingly
   deployed in both basic and preclinical gene transfer settings. Often,
   however, the IDLV transgene expression profile is muted when compared to
   that of their integration-proficient counterparts. We hypothesized that
   the episomal nature of IDLVs turns them into preferential targets for
   epigenetic silencing involving chromatin-remodeling histone
   deacetylation. Therefore, vectors carrying an array of cis-acting
   elements and transcriptional unit components were assembled with the aid
   of packaging constructs encoding either the wild-type or the class I
   mutant D116N integrase moieties. The transduction levels and
   transgene-product yields provided by each vector class were assessed in
   the presence and absence of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
   sodium butyrate and trichostatin A. To investigate the role of the
   target cell replication status, we performed experiments in
   growth-arrested human mesenchymal stem cells and in post-mitotic
   syncytial myotubes. We found that IDLVs are acutely affected by HDACs
   regardless of their genetic makeup or target cell replication rate.
   Interestingly, the magnitude of IDLV transgene expression rescue due to
   HDAC inhibition varied in a vector backbone-and cell type-dependent
   manner. Finally, investigation of histone modifications by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) revealed a
   paucity of euchromatin marks distributed along IDLV genomes when
   compared to those measured on isogenic integration-competent vector
   templates. These findings support the view that IDLVs constitute
   preferential targets for epigenetic silencing involving histone
   deacetylation, which contributes to dampening their full transcriptional
   potential. Our data provide leads on how to most optimally titrate and
   deploy these promising episomal gene delivery vehicles.

TI Neural correlates of settlement in veliger larvae of the gastropod,
   Crepidula fornicata
SO INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY
AB Settlement behavior of molluscan veliger larvae prior to metamorphosis
   requires cessation of swimming, accomplished by arrest of prototrochal
   cilia on the margin of the velum (the larval swimming organ). Ciliary
   arrest in larvae of gastropods is mediated by an action potential that
   occurs synchronously across the velum as a consequence of electrical
   coupling between the prototrochal ciliated cells. We developed a
   preparation for extracellular recording of such ciliary arrest spikes
   from intact swimming and crawling veliger larvae of the caenogastropod
   Crepidula fornicata, using a fine wire electrode. Ciliary arrest spike
   rates during bouts of substrate crawling were significantly higher than
   those recorded during preceding swimming periods in larvae that were
   competent for metamorphosis, but not in precompetent larvae. Spike rates
   were similar on clean polystyrene substrates, and on substrates that had
   been coated with a natural cue for metamorphosis (mucus from conspecific
   adults). We used immunohistochemical methods to localize neuromodulators
   that might regulate the function of velar cilia. Labeled terminals for
   serotonin, FMRFamide, and tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme for
   catecholamine synthesis) were located in positions consistent with
   modulatory effects on the prototrochal ciliated cells. Prototrochal
   ciliary arrest spike rates and beat frequencies were measured in
   isolated velar lobes from competent larvae, which were exposed to
   serotonin, FMRFamide, and dopamine (105molL1). Serotonin abolished
   arrest spiking and increased beat frequency; dopamine also increased
   beat frequency, and FMRFamide depressed it. Competent larvae tested in a
   small static water column swam to the top of the column when exposed to
   serotonin, but occupied lower positions than controls when in the
   presence of dopamine and FMRFamide. The larval nervous system appears to
   regulate velar functions that are critical for settlement behavior, and
   is likely to do so by integrating different sensory modalities in an
   age-dependent manner.

TI Thyroid Volume and Severity of Graves' Orbitopathy
SO THYROID
AB Background: Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is thought to be related to one or
   more autoantigens present in the thyroid and in orbital tissues.
   Although this may not imply a quantitative relation between thyroid
   antigens and degree of GO, which in turn is a risk factor for a more
   pronounced GO, we postulated that the severity of GO may parallel the
   amount of thyroid tissue, namely, the size of the thyroid gland. This
   hypothesis is also based on the observation that patients with Graves'
   disease presenting with large goiters tend to have more severe
   hyperthyroidism. Thus, we evaluated retrospectively whether there is a
   correlation between the degree of GO at its first observation and, among
   other parameters, the thyroid volume.
   Methods: Eighty-six consecutive patients with untreated GO lasting for
   no longer than 24 months underwent an endocrinological and an
   ophthalmological evaluation, the latter including: exophthalmometry,
   eyelid width, clinical activity score (CAS), diplopia, and visual
   acuity. The overall degree of GO was ranked using the NOSPECS score as
   well as a modification of the NOSPECS score. The following parameters
   were considered for correlations: time since GO appearance, time since
   detection of hyperthyroidism, FT3, anti-thyrotropin receptor antibodies,
   thyroid volume, and cigarette-years.
   Results: Thyroid volume, but not the other parameters, correlated
   significantly by simple regression with exophthalmometry (p = 0.02) and
   CAS (p = 0.02). The standard NOSPECS score correlated with FT3 (p =
   0.05), thyroid volume (p = 0.02), and cigarette-years (p = 0.03), by
   simple, but not by multiple regression analysis. The modified NOSPECS
   score correlated with thyroid volume (p = 0.007) and cigarette-years (p
   = 0.04) by simple regression, and with thyroid volume also by multiple
   regression analysis (p = 0.05).
   Conclusions: Thyroid volume correlates with the severity of GO at its
   first observation, especially with exophthalmometry and CAS. The finding
   is in line with a possible pathogenetic role of antigens shared by the
   thyroid and orbital tissues. Nevertheless, other mechanisms may explain
   this observation, including an overall more reactive immune system in
   patients with a large goiter, resulting in more severe thyroid and eye
   disease, regardless of the nature of the autoantigen, or whether it is
   shared by the thyroid and the orbit.

TI ATR-like kinase Mec1 facilitates both chromatin accessibility at DNA
   replication forks and replication fork progression during replication
   stress
SO GENES & DEVELOPMENT
AB Faithful DNA replication is essential for normal cell division and
   differentiation. In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication takes place on
   chromatin. This poses the critical question as to how DNA replication
   can progress through chromatin, which is inhibitory to all DNA-dependent
   processes. Here, we developed a novel genome-wide method to measure
   chromatin accessibility to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) that is
   normalized for nucleosome density, the NCAM (normalized chromatin
   accessibility to MNase) assay. This method enabled us to discover that
   chromatin accessibility increases specifically at and ahead of DNA
   replication forks in normal S phase and during replication stress. We
   further found that Mec1, a key regulatory ATR-like kinase in the S-phase
   checkpoint, is required for both normal chromatin accessibility around
   replication forks and replication fork rate during replication stress,
   revealing novel functions for the kinase in replication stress response.
   These results suggest a possibility that Mec1 may facilitate DNA
   replication fork progression during replication stress by increasing
   chromatin accessibility around replication forks.

TI Signaling pathways in follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas
   (Review)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignant endocrine neoplasia.
   Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) represent more than 90% of all
   thyroid carcinomas and comprise the papillary and follicular thyroid
   carcinoma subtypes. Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas correspond to less
   than 1% of all thyroid tumors and can arise de novo or by
   dedifferentiation of a differentiated tumor. The etiology of DTCs is not
   fully understood. Several genetic events have been implicated in thyroid
   tumorigenesis. Point mutations in the BRAF or RAS genes or rearranged in
   transformation (RET)/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) gene
   rearrangements are observed in approximately 70% of papillary cancer
   cases. Follicular carcinomas commonly harbor RAS mutations and paired
   box gene 8 (PAX8)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR
   gamma) rearrangements. Anaplastic carcinomas may have a wide set of
   genetic alterations, that include gene effectors in the
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   (PI3K) and/or beta-catenin signaling pathways. These distinct genetic
   alterations constitutively activate the MAPK, PI3K and beta-catenin
   signaling pathways, which have been implicated in thyroid cancer
   development and progression. In this context, the evaluation of specific
   genes, as well as the knowledge of their effects on thyroid
   carcinogenesis may provide important information on disease
   presentation, prognosis and therapy, through the development of specific
   tyrosine kinase targets. In this review, we aimed to present an updated
   and comprehensive review of the recent advances in the understanding of
   the genetic basis of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, as well
   as the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor development and
   progression.

TI H3K9 Trimethylation Precedes DNA Methylation during Sheep Oogenesis:
   HDAC1, SUV39H1, G9a, HP1, and Dnmts Are Involved in These Epigenetic
   Events
SO JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY & CYTOCHEMISTRY
AB The oocyte, to become a fully mature gamete, has to acquire a correct
   pattern of DNA methylation on its genome; this epigenetic event
   represents the major point of the molecular mechanisms that occur during
   postnatal oogenesis. It is known that an intimate link exists between
   DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications, such as
   trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3), that is essential in
   the silencing of gene transcription. What remains unclear is the precise
   sequence of these two epigenetic events and the protein expression of
   the enzymes that catalyze this epigenetic maturation during oogenesis.
   To identify the key molecules involved in global DNA methylation and
   H3K9me3, a biological network-based computational model was realized.
   Then, the spatiotemporal distribution of the proteins, identified from
   the biological network, was assessed during postnatal oogenesis. The
   results obtained suggest the existence of a sequential cascade of events
   in which H3K9me3 is the primary step followed by DNA methylation. These
   two epigenetic marks are realized due to the recruitment of the HDAC1,
   SUV39H1, G9a, HP1, and Dnmt3a, which were always localized in the nuclei
   of the oocytes and were dependent on chromatin configuration. These
   results involving DNA methylation and H3K9me3 are crucial in defining
   the oocyte developmental competence. (J Histochem Cytochem 61: 75-89,

TI Rare Tracheal Tumors and Lesions Initially Diagnosed as Isolated
   Differentiated Thyroid Cancers
SO THYROID
AB Background: Thyroid carcinoma with tracheal invasion is uncommon;
   however, this is significantly more prevalent than primary tracheal
   tumors. Rare tracheal tumors at the level of the thyroid can be
   misinterpreted as invasive thyroid cancer upon initial diagnosis. We
   present a series of tumors within the tracheal wall that were initially
   misdiagnosed as isolated, but aggressive, thyroid cancer, and later
   diagnosed to be different histopathologic entities.
   Methods: The series consisted of four women and five men, all but two
   age 60 or older, who were initially diagnosed with tracheal invasion
   from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Eight had obstructive
   airway symptoms and one experienced gagging and choking sensations.
   Preoperatively, the patients underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and
   imaging studies. A complete resection of the involved airway in
   combination with the thyroid gland was performed in all patients.
   Results: In this series of patients, the final diagnosis was tracheal
   stenosis, recurrent laryngeal nerve schwannoma, papillary thyroid
   carcinoma (PTC) with benign intratracheal thyroid tissue, adenoid cystic
   carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, each in one patient. Two
   patients had a tracheal chondrosarcoma, and two patients had collision
   tumors (PTC with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma). All patients were
   misunderstood preoperatively as having isolated DTC with aggressive
   involvement of the trachea. An accurate diagnosis in these cases was
   difficult due to misleading FNA readings, thought due to the FNA needle
   passing through the thyroid before reaching the trachea or a tumor that
   abuts both structures on imaging. Primary tracheal tumors and a
   nontumorous lesion, as well as benign thyroidal masses, mimicked
   invasive thyroid carcinoma in this preoperative setting.
   Conclusions: Various entities other than thyroid cancer can masquerade
   as invasive thyroid cancer. In patients with an FNA showing thyroid
   tissue or suggesting PTC, but also have obstructive or other airway
   symptoms, physician awareness is needed to consider the distinct
   possibility of a primary tracheal lesion. Obtaining the correct
   preoperative diagnosis is essential for accurate surgical planning for
   patients with tracheal tumors.

TI Silencing of proviruses in embryonic cells: efficiency, stability and
   chromatin modifications
SO EMBO REPORTS
AB Embryonic stem cells repress retroviral infection through
   transcriptional silencing of proviral DNAs. We characterized two
   distinct mechanisms of silencing in embryonic mouse cells infected by
   Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MLV): a highly efficient one targeting
   the proline transfer RNA primer-binding site (PBSpro), and a less
   efficient one operating independently of the PBS. Rare virus-expressing
   populations were isolated, and the timing and efficiency of
   establishment of silencing were determined. Superinfection of the
   selected virus-expressing cells with a second virus carrying a
   distinguishable reporter revealed that the PBSpro-directed silencing was
   still largely intact, whereas the PBS-independent silencing was
   partially reduced. The timing and stability of silencing, and the
   associated chromatin modifications on newly established and endogenous
   proviruses were determined. The results indicate that epigenetic
   mechanisms with different specificity and efficiency are used to silence
   the exogenous retroviral sequences in embryonic cells.

TI Alternatives to in vivo tests to detect endocrine disrupting chemicals
   (EDCs) in fish and amphibians - screening for estrogen, androgen and
   thyroid hormone disruption
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Endocrine disruption is considered a highly relevant hazard for
   environmental risk assessment of chemicals, plant protection products,
   biocides and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, screening tests with a focus on
   interference with estrogen, androgen, and thyroid hormone pathways in
   fish and amphibians have been developed. However, they use a large
   number of animals and short-term alternatives to animal tests would be
   advantageous. Therefore, the status of alternative assays for endocrine
   disruption in fish and frogs was assessed by a detailed literature
   analysis. The aim was to (i) determine the strengths and limitations of
   alternative assays and (ii) present conclusions regarding chemical
   specificity, sensitivity, and correlation with in vivo data. Data from
   1995 to present were collected related to the detection/testing of
   estrogen-, androgen-, and thyroid-active chemicals in the following test
   systems: cell lines, primary cells, fish/frog embryos, yeast and
   cell-free systems. The review shows that the majority of alternative
   assays measure effects directly mediated by receptor binding or
   resulting from interference with hormone synthesis. Other mechanisms
   were rarely analysed. A database was established and used for a
   quantitative and comparative analysis. For example, a high correlation
   was observed between cell-free ligand binding and cell-based reporter
   cell assays, between fish and frog estrogenic data and between fish
   embryo tests and in vivo reproductive effects. It was concluded that
   there is a need for a more systematic study of the predictive capacity
   of alternative tests and ways to reduce inter-and intra-assay
   variability.

TI Conventional and Nanotechniques for DNA Methylation Profiling
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB DNA methylation is critical for gene silencing and is associated with
   the incidence of many diseases, including cancer. Underlying molecular
   mechanisms of human diseases and tissue-specific gene expression have
   been elucidated based on DNA methylation studies. This review highlights
   the advantages and drawbacks of various methylation screening
   techniques: blotting, genomic sequencing, bisulfite sequencing,
   methylation-specific PCR, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation, microarray
   analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
   mass spectroscopy, nanowire transistor detection procedure, quantum
   dot-based nanoassay, single-molecule real-time detection, fluorimetric
   assay, electrochemical detection, and atomic force spectroscopy. The
   review provides insight for selecting a method or a combination of
   methods for DNA methylation analysis. Convergence of conventional and
   contemporary nanotechniques to enumerate methylation at specific CpG
   sites of oncogene would fill the gap in diagnosis of cancer. (3 Mol

TI Human diseases versus mouse models: insights into the regulation of
   genomic imprinting at the human 11p15/mouse distal chromosome 7 region
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS
AB The 11p15 region is organised into two independent imprinted domains
   controlled by imprinting control regions, which carry opposite germline
   imprints. Dysregulation of 11p15 genomic imprinting results in two human
   fetal growth disorders (Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS, MIM 180860) and
   Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, MIM 130650)) with opposite growth
   phenotypes. The mouse orthologous region on distal chromosome 7 (dist7)
   is well conserved in its organisation and its regulation. Targeted
   mutagenesis in mice has provided highly valuable clues in terms of the
   mechanisms involved in the regulation of genomic imprinting of the
   11p15/dist7 imprinted region. On the other hand, the recent
   identification of unexpected genetic defects in BWS and SRS patients
   also brought new insights into the mechanisms of 11p15 imprinting
   regulation. However, some mouse models and human genetic defects show
   contradictions in term of growth phenotypes and parental transmission.
   In this review, we extensively analyse those various mouse and human
   models and more particularly models with mutations affecting the two
   imprinting centres, in order to improve our understanding of regulation
   of 11p15/dist7 genomic imprinting.

TI DNA Methylation as a Mechanism of Nutritional Plasticity: Limited
   Support From Horned Beetles
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL
   EVOLUTION
AB Epigenetic changes to DNA, potentially heritable alterations above the
   sequence level, such as DNA methylation, are thought to underlie many
   instances of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Our understanding of the
   links between epigenetic variation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity in
   natural populations is limited. If DNA methylation underlies adaptive
   responses to different nutritional environments, methylation patterns
   should be correlated with differences in performance across nutritional
   environments, and respond to changes in the environment. Additionally,
   genotypes that can cope with a broader range of nutritional environments
   are expected to have greater flexibility in methylation patterns. We
   tested these predictions using horned beetles (genus Onthophagus), which
   can cope with a wide range of variation in larval nutrition. We surveyed
   levels of methylation across several methylated loci in lab-reared
   beetles originating from natural populations using a
   methylation-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   analysis. For less than half the of the loci investigated, methylation
   level was correlated with performance, measured as adult body size
   attained on a given diet, in different nutritional environments, with an
   overall greater effect in males (the more nutritionally plastic sex)
   than females. Methylation levels at most sites were influenced more by
   genotype (iso-female line) than by environment (dung type). Only 1 site
   (of 12) showed a significant genotype-by-environment interaction. Taken
   together, our results provide modest support for the hypothesis that DNA
   methylation underlies nutritional plasticity, as only 816% of methylated
   sites conformed to all of our predictions. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

TI mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation status of CDKi p21 and p57
   genes in ex vivo expanded CD34(+) cells following co-culture with
   mesenchymal stromal cells and growth factors
SO HEMATOLOGY
AB Background: Several studies indicate that ex vivo cytokine-based
   expansion of cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells can induce cell cycle
   abnormality in expanded cells. Cycline-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21
   and p57, are critical regulators of cell cycle. We investigated mRNA
   expression and promoter DNA methylation status of p21 and p57 genes in
   ex vivo expanded CD34(+) cells in different culture conditions.
   Materials and methods: Human CB CD34(+) cells were cultured either in
   cytokine-supplemented liquid culture or in co-culture with mesenchymal
   stromal cells (co-culture system) in presence and absence of cytokine.
   After 14 days, expansion fold in total nucleated cells (TNCs), CD34(+)
   cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells and colony-forming units in culture (CFU-C)
   count was determined. Moreover, mRNA expression level and promoter DNA
   methylation status of p21 and p57 genes in expanded CD34(+) cells were
   analyzed by realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) and methylation-specific PCR technique, respectively.
   Results: Maximum expansion of TNC, CD34(+) cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells
   and CFU-C was seen at day 10 in all three culture conditions. p21 and
   p57 mRNA expression level decreased in both cytokine liquid culture and
   co-culture system with cytokine, while in the co-culture system without
   cytokine, the mRNA expression of p21 and p57 genes relatively increased.
   In addition, promoter DNA methylation status of p21 and p57 genes did
   not change during expansion in all three culture conditions.
   Conclusions: Co-culture of CB CD34(+) cells with mesenchymal stromal
   cells, especially in the absence of cytokines, maintained mRNA
   expression of p21 and p57 genes in ex vivo expanded CD34(+) cells.
   Moreover, transcriptional repression of p21 and p57 genes in ex vivo
   expanded CD34(+) cells was not mediated by promoter DNA methylation.

SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an endocrine disruptor
   affecting the reproductive system in humans. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the effects of TCDD administered to pregnant mice at two
   different doses (2-10 ng/kg/day), on imprinted genes in the male
   offspring. The degree of methylation and the mRNA expression of Snrpn,
   Peg3 and Igf2r were analyzed in the sperm, skeletal muscle and liver.
   TCDD administration (10 ng/kg/day) decreased the sperm count in the male
   offspring. It did not affect methylation but increased mRNA expression
   of Snrpn, Peg3, Igf2r and Air ncRNA. In muscle and liver, TCDD (10
   ng/kg/day) induced increases in methylation and decreases in mRNA
   expression of Igf2r. These results show that the robust effects of TCDD
   on the mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3 and Igf2r genes in the sperm and
   of Igf2r in the muscle and liver are unrelated to changes in methylation
   in their respective genes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Allergen Sensitization Is Associated with Increased DNA Methylation in
   Older Men
SO INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: Variation in epigenetic modifications, arising from either
   environmental exposures or internal physiological changes, can influence
   gene expression and may ultimately contribute to complex diseases such
   as asthma and allergies. We examined the association of asthma and
   allergic phenotypes with DNA methylation levels of
   retrotrans-poson-derived elements. Methods: We used data from 704 men
   (mean age 73 years) in the longitudinal Normative Aging Study to assess
   the relationship between asthma, allergic phenotypes and DNA methylation
   levels of the retrotrans-poson-derived elements Alu and long
   interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1. Retrotransposons represent a
   large fraction of the genome (>30%) and are heavily methylated to
   prevent expression. Percent methylation of Alu and LINE-1 elements in
   peripheral white blood cells was quantified using PCR pyrosequencing.
   Data on sensitization to common allergens from skin prick testing,
   asthma and methacholine responsiveness were gathered approximately 8
   years prior to DNA methylation analysis. Results: Prior allergen
   sensitization was associated with increased methylation of Alu (beta =
   0.32 for sensitized vs. nonsensitized patients; p = 0.003) in models
   adjusted for pack-years of smoking, body mass index, current smoking,
   air pollutants, percentage of eosinophils, white blood cell count and
   age. Of the men interviewed, 5% of subjects reported a diagnosis of
   asthma. Neither Alu nor LINE-1 methylation was associated with asthma.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that increased DNA methylation of
   repetitive elements may be associated with allergen sensitization but
   does not appear to be associated with asthma. Future work is needed to
   identify potential underlying mechanisms for these relationships.

TI FadE: whole genome methylation analysis for multiple sequencing
   platforms
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB DNA methylation plays a central role in genomic regulation and disease.
   Sodium bisulfite treatment (SBT) causes unmethylated cytosines to be
   sequenced as thymine, which allows methylation levels to reflected in
   the number of 'C'-'C' alignments covering reference cytosines. Di-base
   color reads produced by lifetech's SOLiD sequencer provide unreliable
   results when translated to bases because single sequencing errors effect
   the downstream sequence. We describe FadE, an algorithm to accurately
   determine genome-wide methylation rates directly in color or nucleotide
   space. FadE uses SBT unmethylated and untreated data to determine
   background error rates and incorporate them into a model which uses
   Newton-Raphson optimization to estimate the methylation rate and provide
   a credible interval describing its distribution at every reference
   cytosine. We sequenced two slides of human fibroblast cell-line
   bisulfite-converted fragment library with the SOLiD sequencer to
   investigate genome-wide methylation levels. FadE reported widespread

TI Absence of global hypomethylation in promoter hypermethylated Mixed
   Lineage Leukaemia-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Background: Mixed Lineage Leukaemia (MLL)-rearranged acute lymphoblastic
   leukaemia (ALL) in infants represents a highly aggressive type of
   leukaemia that is often characterised by severe promoter CpG island
   hypermethylation. Consequently, MLL-rearranged ALL cells respond well to
   demethylating cytosine analogue drugs. In human cancer cells, enhanced
   promoter methylation is typically accompanied by global loss of
   methylation in non-promoter regions of the genome. In turn, global
   hypomethylation usually leads to genomic instability, which may have
   contributed to cancer development.
   Design and methods: Here we examined global methylation densities in
   MLL-rearranged infant ALL (n = 45) samples in comparison with germline
   MLL infant ALL (n = 11), non-infant B-cell precursor ALL (n = 11) and
   normal paediatric bone marrow (n = 9) samples. For this we performed
   high-resolution bisulfite pyrosequencing to determine methylation levels
   at the repetitive elements LINE-1, Alu and satellite alpha (SAT-alpha).
   As an additional measure of global methylation levels we used the
   LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA).
   Results: We found that MLL-rearranged infant ALL is not characterised by
   global hypomethylation, despite its characteristic promoter CpG
   hypermethylation patterns. Instead we observed a moderate trend towards
   global hypermethylation and demonstrated that these methylated
   non-promoter sequences are responsive to demethylating agents.
   Conclusions: MLL-rearranged infant ALL cells are characterised by an
   overall methylated genomic state, and both promoter and non-promoter
   methylation responds to demethylating agents, which may further explain
   the remarkable sensitivity of these cells for the methylation-inhibiting
   therapeutics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI CpG_MPs: identification of CpG methylation patterns of genomic regions
   from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB High-throughput bisulfite sequencing is widely used to measure cytosine
   methylation at single-base resolution in eukaryotes. It permits
   systems-level analysis of genomic methylation patterns associated with
   gene expression and chromatin structure. However, methods for
   large-scale identification of methylation patterns from bisulfite
   sequencing are lacking. We developed a comprehensive tool, CpG_MPs, for
   identification and analysis of the methylation patterns of genomic
   regions from bisulfite sequencing data. CpG_MPs first normalizes
   bisulfite sequencing reads into methylation level of CpGs. Then it
   identifies unmethylated and methylated regions using the methylation
   status of neighboring CpGs by hotspot extension algorithm without
   knowledge of pre-defined regions. Furthermore, the conservatively and
   differentially methylated regions across paired or multiple samples
   (cells or tissues) are identified by combining a combinatorial algorithm
   with Shannon entropy. CpG_MPs identified large amounts of genomic
   regions with different methylation patterns across five human bisulfite
   sequencing data during cellular differentiation. Different sequence
   features and significantly cell-specific methylation patterns were
   observed. These potentially functional regions form candidate regions
   for functional analysis of DNA methylation during cellular
   differentiation. CpG_MPs is the first user-friendly tool for identifying
   methylation patterns of genomic regions from bisulfite sequencing data,
   permitting further investigation of the biological functions of
   genome-scale methylation patterns.

TI Epigenetics of the Depressed Brain: Role of Histone Acetylation and
   Methylation
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Major depressive disorder is a chronic, remitting syndrome involving
   widely distributed circuits in the brain. Stable alterations in gene
   expression that contribute to structural and functional changes in
   multiple brain regions are implicated in the heterogeneity and
   pathogenesis of the illness. Epigenetic events that alter chromatin
   structure to regulate programs of gene expression have been associated
   with depression-related behavior, antidepressant action, and resistance
   to depression or 'resilience' in animal models, with increasing evidence
   for similar mechanisms occurring in postmortem brains of depressed
   humans. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding
   of epigenetic contributions to depression, in particular the role of
   histone acetylation and methylation, which are revealing novel
   mechanistic insight into the syndrome that may aid in the development of
   novel targets for depression treatment. Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews

TI Control of epigenetic states by WT1 via regulation of de novo DNA
   methyltransferase 3A
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB Although tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation is a universal feature
   of cancer cells, little is known about the necessary molecular triggers.
   Here, we show that Wilms tumour 1 (WT1), a developmental master
   regulator that can also act as a tumour suppressor or oncoprotein,
   transcriptionally regulates the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A
   (DNMT3A) and that cellular WT1 levels can influence DNA methylation of
   gene promoters genome-wide. Specifically, we demonstrate that depletion
   of WT1 by short-interfering RNAs leads to reduced DNMT3A in Wilms tumour
   cells and human embryonal kidney-derived cell lines. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate WT1 recruitment to the DNMT3A
   promoter region and reporter assays confirm that WT1 directly
   transactivates DNMT3A expression. Consistent with this regulatory role,
   immunohistochemical analysis shows co-expression of WT1 and DNMT3A
   proteins in nuclei of blastemal cells in human fetal kidney and Wilms
   tumours. Using genome-wide promoter methylation arrays, we show that
   human embryonal kidney cells over-expressing WT1 acquire DNA methylation
   changes at specific gene promoters where DNMT3A recruitment is
   increased, with hypermethylation being associated with silencing of gene
   expression. Elevated DNMT3A is also demonstrated at hypermethylated
   genes in Wilms' tumour cells, including a region of long-range
   epigenetic silencing. Finally, we show that depletion of WT1 in Wilms
   tumour cells can lead to reactivation of gene expression from methylated
   promoters, such as TGFB2, a key modulator of epithelialmesenchymal
   transitions. Collectively, our work defines a new regulatory modality
   for WT1 involving elicitation of epigenetic alterations which is most
   likely crucial to its functions in development and disease.

TI Mammalian cells acquire epigenetic hallmarks of human cancer during
   immortalization
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Progression to malignancy requires that cells overcome senescence and
   switch to an immortal phenotype. Thus, exploring the genetic and
   epigenetic changes that occur during senescence/immortalization may help
   elucidate crucial events that lead to cell transformation. In the
   present study, we have globally profiled DNA methylation in relation to
   gene expression in primary, senescent and immortalized mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts. Using a high-resolution genome-wide mapping technique,
   followed by extensive locus-specific validation assays, we have
   identified 24 CpG islands that display significantly higher levels of
   CpG methylation in immortalized cell lines as compared to primary murine
   fibroblasts. Several of these hypermethylated CpG islands are associated
   with genes involved in the MEK-ERK pathway, one of the most frequently
   disrupted pathways in cancer. Approximately half of the hypermethylated
   targets are developmental regulators, and bind to the repressive
   Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, often in the context of bivalent
   chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells. Because PcG-associated aberrant
   DNA methylation is a hallmark of several human malignancies, our
   methylation data suggest that epigenetic reprogramming of pluripotency
   genes may initiate cell immortalization. Consistent with methylome
   alterations, global gene expression analysis reveals that the vast
   majority of genes dysregulated during cell immortalization belongs to
   gene families that converge into the MEK-ERK pathway. Additionally,
   several dysregulated members of the MAP kinase network show concomitant
   hypermethylation of CpG islands. Unlocking alternative epigenetic routes
   for cell immortalization will be paramount for understanding crucial
   events leading to cell transformation. Unlike genetic alterations,
   epigenetic changes are reversible events, and as such, can be amenable
   to pharmacological interventions, which makes them appealing targets for
   cancer therapy when genetic approaches prove inadequate.

TI Vimentin DNA methylation predicts survival in breast cancer
SO BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB The Vimentin gene plays a pivotal role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition and is known to be overexpressed in the prognostically poor
   basal-like breast cancer subtype. Recent studies have reported Vimentin
   DNA methylation in association with poor clinical outcomes in other
   solid tumors, but not in breast cancer. We therefore quantified Vimentin
   DNA methylation using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in breast tumors and
   matched normal pairs in association with gene expression and survival in
   a hospital-based study of breast cancer patients. Gene expression data
   via qRT-PCR in cell lines and oligomicroarray data from breast tissues
   were correlated with percent methylation in the Vimentin promoter. A
   threshold of 20 percent average methylation compared with matched normal
   pairs was set for bivariate and multivariate tests of association
   between methylation and tumor subtype, tumor histopathology, and
   survival. Vimentin was differentially methylated in luminal breast
   cancer cell lines, and in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2-enriched breast
   tumor subtypes, but was rare in basal-like cell lines and tumors.
   Increased methylation was strongly correlated with decreased mRNA
   expression in cell lines, and had a moderate inverse correlation in
   breast tumors. Vimentin methylation predicted poor overall survival
   independent of race, subtype, stage, nodal status, or metastatic disease
   and holds promise as a new prognostic biomarker for breast cancer
   patients.

TI SP1 mediates the link between methylation of the tumour suppressor
   miR-149 and outcome in colorectal cancer
SO JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Although recent studies indicate that DNA methylation contributes to the
   down-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC), this
   field remains largely unexplored. To identify methylation-silenced
   miRNAs and clarify their role in CRC, we performed a microarray analysis
   and screened for miRNAs that were induced in CRC cells by
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment or by the knockdown of DNA
   methyltransferases. The DNA methylation status of the candidate miRNA
   was analysed by bisulphite sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR.
   We found that miRNA-149 (miR-149) was epigenetically silenced in CRC and
   down-regulation of miR-149 was associated with hypermethylation of the
   neighbouring CpG island (CGI). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated
   that the miR-149 level was markedly reduced in 51.6% of the CRC tissues
   compared with matched non-cancerous tissues. In addition, low expression
   of miR-149 was associated with a greater depth of invasion (p = 0.012),
   lower 5-year survival rate (p = 0.025), and was found to be an
   independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.016) in a
   multivariate analysis. Moreover, transfection of miR-149 inhibited cell
   growth and invasion of CRC cells in vitro. We also identified mRNA for
   Specificity Protein 1 (SP1, Sp1), a potential oncogenic protein, as a
   target of miR-149. Our data suggest that, as a methylation-sensitive
   miRNA, miR-149 may play an important role as a tumour suppressor in CRC,
   which has prognostic and therapeutic implications. Copyright (C) 2012

TI Allotransplantation of cryopreserved prepubertal mouse ovaries restored
   puberty and fertility without affecting methylation profile of Snrpn-DMR
SO FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB Objective: To evaluate the genetic safety of vitrification on the
   methylation imprints and the development and fertility potential of
   prepubertal mouse ovaries.
   Design: Experimental animal study.
   Setting: University-based fertility center.
   Animal(s): Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) 10-day-old female mice,
   10-week-old adult female mice, and 12-week-old adult male mice.
   Intervention(s): Vitrification of juvenile mouse ovaries was performed
   using ED20 and EG5.5/30 solutions followed by retrieval of fresh and
   vitrified-warmed germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes for Snrpn differentially
   methylated regions (DMR) methylation analyses, collection of mature
   oocytes from superovulated ovarian grafts, in vitro fertility(IVF), and
   early embryonic development after heterotopic allotransplantation.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Analysis of methylation status of Snrpn-DMR,
   percentage of fertilization, and blastocysts formation.
   Result(s): Methylation status of Snrpn-DMR from vitrified-warmed GV
   oocytes did not show significant alteration compared with that of
   controls, although a significant reduction of viable oocytes was
   observed. Puberty as well as endocrine function was restored, and no
   significant difference was shown in number of follicles, percentage of
   mice retaining fertility, and blastocyst formation among three groups.
   Conclusion(s): Our study proved that vitrification of prepubertal mouse
   ovaries did not alter the methylation profile of Snrpn-DMR and
   subsequent allotransplantation; IVF could restore the development and
   fertility potential. (Fertil Steril (R) 2013;99:241-7. (C) 2013 by

TI Effect of CpG methylation at different sequence context on acrolein- and
   BPDE-DNA binding and mutagenesis
SO CARCINOGENESIS
AB Acrolein (Acr), an ,-unsaturated aldehyde, is abundant in tobacco smoke
   and cooking and exhaust fumes. Acr induces mutagenic - and -
   hydroxy-1,N(2)-cyclic propano-deoxyguanosine adducts in normal human
   bronchial epithelial cells. Our earlier work has found that Acr-induced
   DNA damage preferentially occurs at lung cancer p53 mutational hotspots
   that contain CpG sites and that methylation at CpG sites enhances
   Acr-DNA binding at these sites. Based on these results, we hypothesized
   that this enhancement of Acr-DNA binding leads to p53 mutational
   hotspots in lung cancer. In this study, using a shuttle vector supF
   system, we tested this hypothesis by determining the effect of CpG
   methylation on Acr-DNA binding and the mutations in human lung
   fibroblasts. We found that CpG methylation enhances Acr-induced
   mutations significantly. Although CpG methylation enhances Acr-DNA
   binging at all CpG sites, it enhances mutations at selectiveuTCGAusites.
   Similarly, we found that CpG methylation enhances benzo(a)pyrene diol
   epoxide binding at all CpG- sites. However, the methylated CpG sequences
   in which benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide-induced mutations are enhanced are
   different from the CpG sequences in which Acr-induced mutations are
   enhanced. CpG methylation greatly increases Acr-induced G to T and G to
   A mutation frequency to levels similar to these types of mutations found
   in the CpG sites in the p53 gene in tobacco smokerelated lung cancer.
   These results indicate that both CpG sequence context and the chemical
   nature of the carcinogens are crucial factors for determining the effect
   of CpG methylation on mutagenesis.

TI Epigenetics and Cardiovascular Disease
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB A commonly-assumed paradigm holds that the primary genetic determinant
   of cardiovascular disease resides within the DNA sequence of our genes.
   This paradigm can be challenged. For example, how do sequence changes in
   the non-coding region of the genome influence phenotype? Why are all
   diseases not shared between identical twins? Part of the answer lies in
   the fact that the environment or exogenous stimuli clearly influence
   disease susceptibility, but it was unclear in the past how these effects
   were signalled to the static DNA code. Epigenetics is providing a newer
   perspective on these issues. Epigenetics refers to chromatin-based
   mechanisms important in the regulation of gene expression that do not
   involve changes to the DNA sequence per se. The field can be broadly
   categorized into three areas: DNA base modifications (including cytosine
   methylation and cytosine hydroxymethylation), post-translational
   modifications of histone proteins, and RNA-based mechanisms that operate
   in the nucleus. Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached
   from the epigenetic perspective, including those associated with
   atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and the
   cardiovascular response to hypoxia and shear stress, among many others.
   With increasing interest and expanding partnerships in the field, we can
   expect new insights to emerge from epigenetic perspectives of
   cardiovascular health. This paper reviews the principles governing
   epigenetic regulation, discusses their presently-understood importance
   in cardiovascular disease, and considers the growing significance we are
   likely to attribute to epigenetic contributions in the future, as they
   provide new mechanistic insights and a host of novel clinical
   applications.

TI Viral Genome Methylation Differentially Affects the Ability of BZLF1
   versus BRLF1 To Activate Epstein-Barr Virus Lytic Gene Expression and
   Viral Replication
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early proteins BZLF1 and BRLF1
   can both induce lytic EBV reactivation when overexpressed in latently
   infected cells. Although EBV genome methylation is required for
   BZLF1-mediated activation of lytic gene expression, the effect of viral
   genome methylation on BRLF1-mediated viral reactivation has not been
   well studied. Here, we have compared the effect of viral DNA methylation
   on BZLF1-versus BRLF1-mediated activation of lytic EBV gene
   transcription and viral genome replication. We show that most early
   lytic viral promoters are preferentially activated by BZLF1 in the
   methylated form, while methylation decreases the ability of BRLF1 to
   activate most early lytic promoters, as well as the BLRF2 late viral
   promoter. Moreover, methylation of bacmid constructs containing the EBV
   genome enhances BZLF1-mediated, but decreases BRLF1-mediated, early
   lytic gene expression. Methylation of viral promoter DNA does not affect
   BRLF1 binding to a variety of different CpG-containing BRLF1 binding
   motifs (RREs) in vitro or in vivo. However, BRLF1 preferentially induces
   H3K9 histone acetylation of unmethylated promoters in vivo. The
   methylated and unmethylated forms of an oriLyt-containing plasmid
   replicate with similar efficiency when transfected into EBV-positive
   cells that express the essential viral replication proteins in trans.
   Most importantly, we demonstrate that lytic viral gene expression and
   replication can be induced by BRLF1, but not BZLF1, expression in an
   EBV-positive telomerase-immortalized epithelial cell line (NOKs-Akata)
   in which lytic viral gene promoters remain largely unmethylated. These
   results suggest that the unmethylated form of the EBV genome can undergo
   viral reactivation and replication in a BRLF1-dependent manner.

TI Cigarette Smoke Condensate Induces Differential Expression and Promoter
   Methylation Profiles of Critical Genes Involved in Lung Cancer in NL-20
   Lung Cells In Vitro: Short-Term and Chronic Exposure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY
AB Establishing early diagnostic markers of harm is critical for effective
   prevention programs and regulation of tobacco products. This study
   examined effects of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) on expression and
   promoter methylation profile of critical genes (DAPK, ECAD, MGMT, and
   RASSF1A) involved in lung cancer development in different human lung
   cell lines. NL-20 cells were treated with 0.1-100 mu g/ml of CSC for 24
   to 72 hrs for short-term exposures. DAPK expression or methylation
   status was not significantly affected. However, CSC treatment resulted
   in changes in expression and promoter methylation profile of ECAD, MGMT,
   and RASSF1A. For chronic studies, cells were exposed to 1 or 10 mu g/ml
   CSC up to 28 days. Cells showed morphological changes associated with
   transformation and changes in invasion capacities and global methylation
   status. This study provides critical data suggesting that epigenetic
   changes could serve as an early biomarker of harm due to exposure to
   cigarette smoke.

TI Identification of DNA methylation of SOX9 in cervical cancer using
   methylated-CpG island recovery assay
SO ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB The aim of the present study was to identify novel methylation markers
   for cervical cancer screening and to test the clinical application of
   the most promising biomarker in cervical scrapings. Methylated-CpG
   island recovery assay-based microarray analysis was carried out on a
   discovery set consisting of cervical cancer tissue and normal cervical
   tissue to identify significantly hypermethylated genes. Five hundred and
   four CpG islands, corresponding to 378 genes, were differentially
   methylated between cervical cancer tissue and normal cervical tissue.
   Among them, 30 genes were significantly hypermethylated. Of the 30
   genes, SOX9, PKLR and DLX4 were selected for further validation by
   direct bisulfite sequencing. The SOX9 gene revealed complete methylation
   in the cervical cancer tissue and complete non-methylation in the normal
   control tissue. A TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay was performed to
   detect the methylation levels of the SOX9 gene in 156 cervical
   scrapings, including 48 normal cervical scrapings, 30 scrapings with
   cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), 30 scrapings with CIN2-3
   and 48 scrapings with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The methylation
   levels (methylation score) of the SOX9 gene increased significantly with
   the severity of cervical squamous lesions. The area under the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) revealed that the methylation
   score of the SOX9 gene could be used to segregate SCC/CIN2-3 from
   CIN1/normal (AUC, 0.961; p=0.000). At the optimal cut-off value, a
   sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 89.7% were obtained. In
   conclusion, SOX9 methylation is frequently involved in cervical
   carcinogenesis, and may provide a valuable molecular biomarker for early
   detection of cervical cancer.

TI Histone Methyltransferase Inhibitors: Novel Epigenetic Agents for Cancer
   Treatment
SO CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in gene activity and
   expression that occur without alteration in DNA sequence. The gene
   transcription is strictly correlated to chromatin structure, which could
   undergo covalent modifications of histones involving acetylation,
   methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Alterations in histones
   are implicated in many diseases, including cancer, by leading to tumor
   suppressor silencing or pro-apoptotic proteins downregulation. Although
   post-translational addition of methyl groups to the histone lysine has
   been discovered three decades ago, the importance of this epigenetic
   modification has emerged only in the last few years. Thenceforward
   histone methyltransferase inhibitors have been developed as potential
   therapeutic cancer agents. It should not be long before some selective
   inhibitors make their way into clinical trials. This review is mainly
   focused on the evolution in the development of new epigenetic modifier
   molecules modulating histone marks.

TI Methylation of RASSF1A gene promoter is regulated by p53 and DAXX
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB Inactivation of the tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 1
   isoform A (RASSF1A) due to epigenetic silencing occurs in a variety of
   human cancers, and still largely unknown are the regulators and
   mechanisms underlying RASSF1A gene promoter methylation. Herein, we
   report that this methylation is regulated by p53 and death-associated
   protein 6 (DAXX) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We found that
   p53 bound to the RASSF1A promoter, recruiting DAXX as well as DNA
   methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) for DNA methylation, which subsequently
   resulted in inactivation of RASSF1A in wild-type p53 ALL cells. Although
   the presence of p53 was required for the recruitment of DAXX and DNMT1
   to the RASSF1A promoter, fluctuation in p53 protein levels did not
   affect the rates of RASSF1A methylation. Conversely, methylation of
   RASSF1A promoter was critically controlled by DAXX, as the enforced
   overexpression of DAXX led to enhanced RASSF1A promoter methylation,
   whereas inhibition of DAXX reduced RASSF1A methylation. Interestingly,
   we found that the p53/DAXX-mediated RASSF1A methylation regulated murine
   double minute 2 (MDM2) protein stability in ALL. Our results reveal a
   novel function for p53 in the methylation of RASSF1A promoter by its
   interaction with DAXX. Discovery of this mechanism provides new insight
   into the interactions among the tumor-related factors p53, RASSF1A,
   DAXX, and MDM2 in cancer pathogenesis.-Zhang, H., He, J., Li, J., Tian,

TI Array-Based Profiling of DNA Methylation Changes Associated with Alcohol
   Dependence
SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background Epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation may influence
   vulnerability to numerous disorders, including alcohol dependence (AD).
   Methods Peripheral blood DNA methylation levels of 384 CpGs in the
   promoter regions of 82 candidate genes were examined in 285 African
   Americans (AAs; 141 AD cases and 144 controls) and 249 European
   Americans (EAs; 144 AD cases and 105 controls) using Illumina GoldenGate
   Methylation Array assays. Association of AD and DNA methylation changes
   was analyzed using multivariate analyses of covariance with frequency of
   intoxication, sex, age, and ancestry proportion as covariates. CpGs
   showing significant methylation alterations in AD cases were further
   examined in a replication sample (49 EA cases and 32 EA controls) using
   Sequenom's MassARRAY EpiTYPER technology. Results In AAs, 2 CpGs in 2
   genes (GABRB3 and POMC) were hypermethylated in AD cases compared with
   controls (p = 0.001). In EAs, 6 CpGs in 6 genes (HTR3A, NCAM1, DRD4,
   MBD3, HTR2B, and GRIN1) were hypermethylated in AD cases compared with
   controls (p = 0.001); CpG cg08989585 in the HTR3A promoter region showed
   a significantly higher methylation level in EA cases than in EA controls
   after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.00007). Additionally, methylation
   levels of 6 CpGs (including cg08989585) in the HTR3A promoter region
   were analyzed in the replication sample. Although the 6 HTR3A promoter
   CpGs did not show significant methylation differences between EA cases
   and EA controls (p = 0.067 to 0.877), the methylation level of CpG
   cg08989585 was nonsignificantly higher in EA cases (26.9%) than in EA
   controls (18.6%; p = 0.139). Conclusions The findings from this study
   suggest that DNA methylation profile appears to be associated with AD in
   a population-specific way and the predisposition to AD may result from a
   complex interplay of genetic variation and epigenetic modifications.

TI Loss of heterozygosity and methylation of multiple tumor suppressor
   genes on chromosome 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Genetic and epigenetic alterations are the two key mechanisms in the
   development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, how they
   contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis and the correlation between them has
   not been fully elucidated.
   A total of 48 paired HCCs and noncancerous tissues were used to detect
   loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and the methylation profiles of five tumor
   suppressor genes (RASSF1A, BLU, FHIT, CRBP1, and HLTF) on chromosome 3
   by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation-specific PCR.
   Gene expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and reverse
   transcription (RT)-PCR.
   Sixteen of 48 (33.3 %) HCCs had LOH on at least one locus on chromosome
   3, and two smallest common deleted regions (3p22.3-24.3 and 3p12.3-14.2)
   were identified. RASSF1A, BLU, and FHIT showed very high frequencies of
   methylation in HCCs (100, 81.3, and 64.6 %, respectively) and
   noncancerous tissues, but not in liver tissues from control patients.
   Well-differentiated HCCs showed high methylation frequencies of these
   genes but very low frequencies of LOH. Furthermore, BLU methylation was
   associated with an increased level of alpha-fetoprotein, and FHIT
   methylation was inversely correlated with HCC recurrence. In comparison,
   CRBP1 showed moderate frequencies of methylation, while HLTF showed low
   frequencies of methylation, and CRBP1 methylation occurred mainly in
   elderly patients. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine demethylated at
   least one of these genes and restored their expression in a DNA
   methylation-dependent or -independent manner.
   Hypermethylation of RASSF1A, BLU, and FHIT is a common and very early
   event in hepatocarcinogenesis; CRBP1 methylation may also be involved in
   the later stage. Although LOH was not too frequent on chromosome 3, it
   may play a role as another mechanism in hepatocarcinogenesis.

TI Promoter methylation of serotonin transporter gene is associated with
   obesity measures: a monozygotic twin study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY
AB OBJECTIVE: Epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly being recognized as an
   important factor for obesity. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4)
   has a critical role in regulating food intake, body weight and energy
   balance. This study examines the potential association between SLC6A4
   promoter methylation and obesity measures in a monozygotic (MZ) twin
   sample.
   METHODS: We studied 84 MZ twin pairs drawn from the Vietnam Era Twin
   Registry. Obesity measures include body mass index (BMI), body weight,
   waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). The SLC6A4 promoter
   methylation profile in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by
   bisulfite pyrosequencing. The association between methylation variation
   and obesity parameters was examined by mixed-model regression and
   matched pair analysis, adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption,
   physical activity and total daily energy intake. Multiple testing was
   controlled using the adjusted false discovery rate (q-value).
   RESULTS: Mean methylation level was positively correlated with BMI (r =
   0.29; P = 0.0002), body weight (r = 0.31; P<0.0001) and WC (r = 0.20; P
   = 0.009), but not WHR. Intra-pair differences in mean methylation were
   significantly correlated with intra-pair differences in BMI, body weight
   and WC, but not WHR. On average, a 1% increase in mean methylation was
   associated with 0.33 kg m(-2) increase in BMI (95% CI: 0.02-0.65; P =
   0.03), 1.16 kg increase in body weight (95% CI, 0.16-2.16; P = 0.02) and
   0.78 cm increase in WC (95% CI, 0.05-1.50; P = 0.03) after controlling
   for potential confounders.
   CONCLUSIONS: SLC6A4 promoter hypermethylation is significantly
   associated with an increased prevalence of obesity within a MZ twin
   study. International Journal of Obesity (2013) 37, 140-145; doi:

TI Epigenetic Modifications in Hepatic Stellate Cells Contribute to Liver
   Fibrosis
SO TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Liver fibrosis represents the final common pathway of virtually all
   types of chronic liver diseases, and it has been a major public health
   concern. Many genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the
   pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, while the mechanisms underlying gene
   regulation still needs further research. On the other hand, hepatic
   stellate cells (HSCs) are quiescent cells in the perisinusoidal space in
   liver. HSCs facilitate hepatocytes interactions via releasing soluble
   inflammatory factors and producing extracellular matrix. HSCs can be
   activated in response to liver injury, and they differentiate to
   myofibroblasts, which greatly contribute to the fibrogenesis process.
   Various epigenetic procedures, including DNA methylation, histone
   modification and formation of particular chromatin structure, play
   crucial roles in the gene transcriptional expression in HSCs, regulating
   various vital processes. For instance, epigenetic modulation on the
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) gene
   promoter accounts for HSC differentiation through interacting pathways.
   Aberrant expression of a series of histones and chemokines in activated
   HSCs can aggravate inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn
   promotes differentiation of HSCs to myofibroblasts and enhances the
   whole fibrogenesis process. Degradation of extracellular matrix is also
   regulated through epigenetic modulation on matrix associated enzymes.
   Moreover, fibrosis-related epigenetic modifications in the parental
   generation may be inherited to their offspring. In this review, we
   firstly summarize the vital epigenetic modifications of fibrosis-related
   genes in HSCs, and highlight specific nucleic acid sequences and
   structures in gene promoters as important action sites, which may
   provide indicators for liver fibrosis diagnosis in the future.

TI Aberrant DNA methylation of imprinted loci in human spontaneous
   abortions after assisted reproduction techniques and natural conception
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB STUDY QUESTION: Do assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) affect DNA
   methylation of imprinted genes and does aberrant methylation of
   imprinted genes account for the incidence of human spontaneous abortion
   (SA)?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Our results show that imprinting errors of imprinted
   genes may contribute to human SA, and the occurrence of aberrant
   methylation of imprinted genes in ART pregnancies was comparable with
   that in natural pregnancies.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Animal data and human studies demonstrated that
   in vitro culture of embryos can cause methylation defects in individual
   genes, which might affect subsequent embryonic development and
   contribute to SA. However, our previous studies showed an abnormal
   methylation pattern of PEG1 in human aborted chrionic villus samples
   (CVS) but an increased occurrence of aberrant methylation in CVS from
   ART-derived pregnancies was not observed.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: CVS were collected from women who
   underwent abortion procedures in the Department of Gynecology and
   Obstetrics in Nanfang Hospital from May 2008 to July 2011. Muscle
   samples (MS) were obtained from aborted fetuses and stillbirths. The
   samples were divided into four experimental groups: (A) SA/stillbirth
   after ART (n = 75), (B) multi-fetal reduction after ART (n 73), (C)
   SA/stillbirth of natural pregnancies (n 90) and (D) induced abortion
   (IA) of natural pregnancies (n 82).
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: The mean +/- SD age of
   patients was 31.0 +/- 4.1 (range: 18-45 years). The DNA methylation
   patterns of one paternally methylated (H19) and two maternally
   methylated (LIT1 and SNRPN) genes were analyzed in CVS and MS using
   pyrosequencing and bisulfite sequencing PCR.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Clear hypo-methylation (<10%) or
   hyper-methylation (>90%) were not detected in LIT1 and SNRPN but two
   regions of hyper-methylation (91.7 and 91.4%) were observed in H19. The
   mean percentage of methylation in the SA samples (groups A and C) was
   higher than that in the IA samples (groups B and D; P < 0.05). Box plot
   analyses showed that in the 165 SA samples, methylation values for
   40/495 (8.1%) differentially methylated regions of the three genes
   represented outliers. The incidence of outlier was highest for LIT1
   (13.3%, 22/165). In contrast, no outliers were found in the 155 IA
   samples. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed a
   positive correlation between percentage methylation of all three genes
   and incidence of SA (P, 0.05). In addition, the conception modes
   (natural versus ART) and the fertilization methods used in ART (IVF and
   ICSI) did not affect the methylation patterns of the imprinted genes. No
   increase in the rate of abnormal methylation was found in the ART
   samples.
   LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION: The studied loci represent only a
   small fraction of developmentally important genes. Further studies are
   needed to evaluate changes in the expression and the methylation status
   of other genes that may lead to SA.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings provide new insights
   into the etiology of human SA. The possibility that the abnormal
   methylation seen is a consequence of the defect that led to the SA
   cannot be excluded.
   STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None of the authors has any
   competing interest. This study was supported by National Natural Science
   Foundation of China (81170574), The National Key Basic Research
   Development Plan of China (973 Program) (2007CB948104), Comprehensive

TI RNA polymerase V targets transcriptional silencing components to
   promoters of protein-coding genes
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB Transcriptional gene silencing controls transposons and other repetitive
   elements through RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and heterochromatin
   formation. A key component of the Arabidopsis RdDM pathway is ARGONAUTE4
   (AGO4), which associates with siRNAs to mediate DNA methylation. Here,
   we show that AGO4 preferentially targets transposable elements embedded
   within promoters of protein-coding genes. This pattern of AGO4 binding
   cannot be simply explained by the sequences of AGO4-bound siRNAs;
   instead, AGO4 binding to specific gene promoters is also mediated by
   long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) produced by RNA polymerase V.
   lncRNA-mediated AGO4 binding to gene promoters directs asymmetric DNA
   methylation to these genomic regions and is involved in regulating the
   expression of targeted genes. Finally, AGO4 binding overlaps sites of
   DNA methylation affected by the biotic stress response. Based on these
   findings, we propose that the targets of AGO4-directed RdDM are
   regulatory units responsible for controlling gene expression under
   specific environmental conditions.

TI H3K9me-Enhanced DNA Hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) Gene: An
   Epigenetic Signature for Spontaneous Transformation of Rat Mesenchymal
   Stem Cells
SO STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB To explore the mechanisms underlying spontaneous transformation of
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), changes in senescence-associated
   molecules, particularly the epigenetic modification of the p16(INK4a)
   gene, including histone H3 lysine 27/9 methylation (H3K27/9me) and DNA
   methylation, were investigated in cultured adult rat bone marrow MSCs at
   different stages during the transformation process. It was shown that
   the MSCs underwent replicative senescence after 24 to 25 population
   doublings, characterized by positive staining for senescence-associated
   beta-galactosidase, increased expression of p16(INK4a) and p21, and
   downregulated phosphorylation of Rb. The upregulation of p16(INK4a) was
   associated with decreased expression of enhancer of the zeste homolog 2
   (Ezh2), and reduced levels of H3K27me and DNA methylation in the
   p16(INK4a) gene. At week 4 of senescence, reproliferating cells emerged
   among the senescent MSCs. These senescence-escaped MSCs lost their
   senescence-related markers (including p16(INK4)a) and became highly
   proliferative. In addition to H3K27me, another H3 modification pattern,
   H3K9me, appeared in the p16(INK4a) gene, accompanied by an enhanced DNA
   methylation. With continued culture, the senescence-escaped MSCs did not
   show any sign of growth arrest and gained the capacity for
   anchorage-independent growth. These immortalized (transformed) MSCs
   showed further enhanced DNA methylation of the p16(INK4a) gene by
   increased H3K9me. Ezh2 knockdown with shRNA eliminated H3K27me-mediated
   DNA methylation of the p16(INK4a) gene in presenescent MSCs, but had no
   effect on H3K9me-enhanced DNA hypermethylation in the cells after
   senescence escape. These findings identify an Ezh2- and
   H3K27me-independent, but H3K9me-enhanced, DNA hypermethylation of the
   p16(INK4a) gene, which might be an epigenetic signature for MSC
   spontaneous transformation.

TI Epigenetic Modification of Sod2 in the Development of Diabetic
   Retinopathy and in the Metabolic Memory: Role of Histone Methylation
SO INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE
AB PURPOSE. Mitochondrial superoxide levels are elevated in the retina in
   diabetes, and their scavenging enzyme, MnSOD, becomes subnormal. The
   objective of this study is to investigate the role of histone
   methylation of Sod2, the gene that encodes MnSOD, in the development of
   diabetic retinopathy and in the metabolic memory phenomenon associated
   with its continued progression after termination of hyperglycemia.
   METHODS. Effect of high glucose on monomethyl H3K4 (H3K4me1), dimethyl
   H3K4 (H3K4me2), and lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) was quantified
   at Sod2 by chromatin immunoprecipitation in isolated retinal endothelial
   cells. The role of histone methylation in the metabolic memory
   phenomenon was investigated in the retina of rats maintained in poor
   glycemic control (PC, approximately 12% glycated hemoglobin [GHb]) for 3
   months followed by in good glycemic control (GC, approximately 6% GHb)
   for 3 months.
   RESULTS. Hyperglycemia reduced H3K4me1 and -me2, and increased the
   binding of LSD1 and Sp1 at Sod2. Regulation of LSD1 by LSD1-siRNA
   ameliorated glucose-induced decrease in H3K4 methylation at Sod2, and
   prevented decrease in Sod2 gene expression. In rats, re-institution of
   GC failed to reverse decrease in H3K4me1 and -me2 at Sod2, and LSD1
   remained active with increased binding of LSD1 and Sp1 at Sod2. Retina
   from human donors with diabetic retinopathy also had decreased H3K4me2
   and increased LSD1 at Sod2.
   CONCLUSIONS. Histone methylation of retinal Sod2 has an important role
   in the development of diabetic retinopathy and in the metabolic memory
   phenomenon associated with its continued progression. Targeting enzymes
   important for histone methylation may serve as a potential therapy to
   halt the development of diabetic retinopathy. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis

TI HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 Interacts with HSL1 and Participates in the
   Repression of Seed Maturation Genes in Arabidopsis Seedlings
SO PLANT CELL
AB The seed maturation genes are specifically and highly expressed during
   late embryogenesis. In this work, yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular
   fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed
   that HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) interacted with the HIGH-LEVEL
   EXPRESSION OF SUGAR-INDUCIBLE GENE2-LIKE1 (HSL1), and the zinc-finger CW
   [conserved Cys (C) and Trp (W) residues] domain of HSL1 was responsible
   for the interaction. Furthermore, we found that mutations in HDA19
   resulted in the ectopic expression of seed maturation genes in
   seedlings, which was associated with increased levels of gene activation
   marks, such as Histone H3 acetylation (H3ac), Histone H4 acetylation
   (H4ac), and Histone H3 Lys 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), but decreased
   levels of the gene repression mark Histone H3 Lys 27 tri-methylation
   (H3K27me3) in the promoter and/or coding regions. In addition, elevated
   transcription of certain seed maturation genes was also found in the
   hsl1 mutant seedlings, which was also accompanied by the enrichment of
   gene activation marks but decreased levels of the gene repression mark.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that HDA19 could directly
   bind to the chromatin of the seed maturation genes. These results
   suggest that HDA19 and HSL1 may act together to repress seed maturation
   gene expression during germination. Further genetic analyses revealed
   that the homozygous hsl1 hda19 double mutants are embryonic lethal,
   suggesting that HDA19 and HSL1 may play a vital role during
   embryogenesis.

TI CTCFBSDB 2.0: a database for CTCF-binding sites and genome organization
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB CTCF is a highly conserved transcriptional regulator protein that
   performs diverse functions such as regulating gene expression and
   organizing the 3D structure of the genome. Here, we describe recent
   updates to a database of CTCF-binding sites, CTCFBSDB
   (http://insulatordb.uthsc.edu/), which now contains almost 15 million
   CTCF-binding sequences in 10 species. Since the original publication of
   the database, studies of the 3D structure of the genome, such as those
   provided by Hi-C experiments, have suggested that CTCF plays an
   important role in mediating intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions.
   To reflect this important progress, we have integrated CTCF-binding
   sites with genomic topological domains defined using Hi-C data.
   Additionally, the updated database includes new features enabled by new
   CTCF-binding site data, including binding site occupancy and the ability
   to visualize overlapping CTCF-binding sites determined in separate
   experiments.

TI Genome-wide profiling of histone H3K4-tri-methylation and gene
   expression in rice under drought stress
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Histone modifications affect gene expression level. Several studies have
   shown that they may play key roles in regulating gene expression in
   plants under abiotic stress, but genome-wide surveys of such
   stress-related modifications are very limited, especially for crops. By
   using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, we investigated the genome-wide distribution
   pattern of histone H3 lysine4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and the
   pattern's association with whole genome expression profiles of rice
   (Oryza sativa L.) under drought stress, one of the major and
   representative abiotic stresses. We detected 51.1 and 48 % of annotated
   genes with H3K4me3 modification in rice seedlings under normal growth
   (control) and drought stress conditions, respectively. By RNA-Seq, 76.7
   and 79 % of annotated genes were detected with expression in rice
   seedlings under the control and drought stress conditions, respectively.
   Furthermore, 4,837 genes were differentially H3K4me3-modified (H3M),
   (3,927 genes with increased H3M; 910 genes with decreased H3M) and 5,866
   genes were differentially expressed (2,145 up-regulated; 3,721
   down-regulated) in drought stress. Differential H3K4me3 methylation only
   affects a small proportion of stress-responsive genes, and the H3K4me3
   modification level was significantly and positively correlated with
   transcript level only for a subset of genes showing changes both in
   modification and expression with drought stress. Moreover, for the
   H3K4me3-regulated stress-related genes, the H3K4me3 modification level
   was mainly increased in genes with low expression and decreased in genes
   with high expression under drought stress. The comprehensive data of
   H3K4me3 and gene expression profiles in rice under drought stress
   provide a useful resource for future epigenomic regulation studies in
   plants under abiotic stresses.

TI Neonatal tryptophan depletion and corticosterone supplementation modify
   emotional responses in adult male mice
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   axis are crucially involved in the regulation of emotions. Specifically,
   spontaneous and/or environmentally mediated modulations of the
   functionality of these systems early in development may favour the onset
   of depressive- and anxiety-related phenotypes. While the independent
   contribution of each of these systems to the emergence of abnormal
   phenotypes has been detailed in clinical and experimental studies, only
   rarely has their interaction been systematically investigated. Here, we
   addressed the effects of reduced serotonin and environmental stress
   during the early stages of postnatal life on emotional regulations in
   mice. To this aim, we administered, to outbred CD1 mouse dams, during
   their first week of lactation, a tryptophan deficient diet (T) and
   corticosterone via drinking water (C; 80 mu g/ml). Four groups of dams
   (animal facility rearing, AFR; T treated, T; C treated, C; T and C
   treated, TC) and their male offspring were used in the study. Maternal
   care was scored throughout treatment and adult offspring were tested
   for: anhedonia (progressive ratio schedule); anxiety-related behaviour
   (approach-avoidance conflict paradigm); BDNF, dopamine and serotonin
   concentrations in selected brain areas. T, C and TC treatments reduced
   active maternal care compared to AFR. Adult IC offspring showed
   significantly increased anxiety- and anhedonia-related behaviours,
   reduced striatal and increased hypothalamic BDNF and reduced dopamine
   and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex and their turnover in the
   hippocampus. Thus, present findings support the view that neonatal
   variations in the functionality of the serotonergic system and of HPA
   axis may jointly contribute to induce emotional disturbances in
   adulthood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Epigenetic Mechanisms in Learned Fear: Implications for PTSD
SO NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB One of the most exciting discoveries in the learning and memory field in
   the past two decades is the observation that active regulation of gene
   expression is necessary for experience to trigger lasting functional and
   behavioral change, in a wide variety of species, including humans. Thus,
   as opposed to the traditional view of 'nature' (genes) being separate
   from 'nurture' (environment and experience), it is now clear that
   experience actively drives alterations in central nervous system (CNS)
   gene expression in an ongoing fashion, and that the resulting
   transcriptional changes are necessary for experience to trigger altered
   long-term behavior. In parallel over the past decade, epigenetic
   mechanisms, including regulation of chromatin structure and DNA
   methylation, have been shown to be potent regulators of gene
   transcription in the CNS. In this review, we describe data supporting
   the hypothesis that epigenetic molecular mechanisms, especially DNA
   methylation and demethylation, drive long-term behavioral change through
   active regulation of gene transcription in the CNS. Specifically, we
   propose that epigenetic molecular mechanisms underlie the formation and
   stabilization of context-and cue-triggered fear conditioning based in
   the hippocampus and amygdala, a conclusion reached in a wide variety of
   studies using laboratory animals. Given the relevance of cued and
   contextual fear conditioning to post-traumatic stress, by extension we
   propose that these mechanisms may contribute to post-traumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) in humans. Moreover, we speculate that epigenetically
   based pharmacotherapy may provide a new avenue of drug treatment for
   PTSD-related cognitive and behavioral function. Neuropsychopharmacology

TI Histone Demethylase KDM6B Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event that occurs
   in embryonic development, tissue repair control, organ fibrosis, and
   carcinoma invasion and metastasis. Although significant progress has
   been made in understanding the molecular regulation of EMT, little is
   known about how chromatin is modified in EMT. Chromatin modifications
   through histone acetylation and methylation determine the precise
   control of gene expression. Recently, histone demethylases were found to
   play important roles in gene expression through demethylating mono-,
   di-, or trimethylated lysines. KDM6B (also known as JMJD3) is a histone
   demethylase that might activate gene expression by removing repressive
   histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation marks from chromatin. Here we report
   that KDM6B played a permissive role in TGF-beta-induced EMT in mammary
   epithelial cells by stimulating SNAI1 expression. KDM6B was induced by
   TGF-beta, and the knockdown of KDM6B inhibited EMT induced by TGF-beta.
   Conversely, overexpression of KDM6B induced the expression of
   mesenchymal genes and promoted EMT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
   assays revealed that KDM6B promoted SNAI1 expression by removing histone
   H3 lysine trimethylation marks. Consistently, our analysis of the
   Oncomine database found that KDM6B expression was significantly
   increased in invasive breast carcinoma compared with normal breast
   tissues. The knockdown of KDM6B significantly inhibited breast cancer
   cell invasion. Collectively, our study uncovers a novel epigenetic
   mechanism regulating EMT and tumor cell invasion, and has important
   implication in targeting cancer metastasis.

TI The Dynamics of Genome-wide DNA Methylation Reprogramming in Mouse
   Primordial Germ Cells
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB Genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming occurs in mouse primordial
   germ cells (PGCs) and preimplantation embryos, but the precise dynamics
   and biological outcomes are largely unknown. We have carried out
   whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) and RNA-Seq across key stages
   from E6.5 epiblast to E16.5 PGCs. Global loss of methylation takes place
   during PGC expansion and migration with evidence for passive
   demethylation, but sequences that carry long-term epigenetic memory
   (imprints, CpG islands on the X chromosome, germline-specific genes)
   only become demethylated upon entry of PGCs into the gonads. The
   transcriptional profile of PGCs is tightly controlled despite global
   hypomethylation, with transient expression of the pluripotency network,
   suggesting that reprogramming and pluripotency are inextricably linked.
   Our results provide a framework for the understanding of the epigenetic
   ground state of pluripotency in the germline.

TI Ordered changes in histone modifications at the core of the Arabidopsis
   circadian clock
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Circadian clock function in Arabidopsis thaliana relies on a complex
   network of reciprocal regulations among oscillator components. Here, we
   demonstrate that chromatin remodeling is a prevalent regulatory
   mechanism at the core of the clock. The peak-to-trough circadian
   oscillation is paralleled by the sequential accumulation of H3
   acetylation (H3K56ac, K9ac), H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and H3K4me2.
   Inhibition of acetylation and H3K4me3 abolishes oscillator gene
   expression, indicating that both marks are essential for gene
   activation. Mechanistically, blocking H3K4me3 leads to increased
   clock-repressor binding, suggesting that H3K4me3 functions as a
   transition mark modulating the progression from activation to
   repression. The histone methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP 2/ARABIDOPSIS
   TRITHORAX RELATED 3 (SDG2/ATXR3) might contribute directly or indirectly
   to this regulation because oscillator gene expression, H3K4me3
   accumulation, and repressor binding are altered in plants misexpressing
   SDG2/ATXR3. Despite divergences in oscillator components, a
   chromatin-dependent mechanism of clock gene activation appears to be
   common to both plant and mammal circadian systems.

TI Stress-induced epigenetic transcriptional memory of acetylcholinesterase
   by HDAC4
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Stress induces long-lasting changes in neuronal gene expression and
   cholinergic neurotransmission, but the underlying mechanism(s) are
   incompletely understood. Here, we report that chromatin structure and
   histone modifications are causally involved in this transcriptional
   memory. Specifically, the AChE gene encoding the
   acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase is known to
   undergo long-lasting transcriptional and alternative splicing changes
   after stress. In mice subjected to stress, we identified two alternative
   5' exons that were down-regulated after stress in the hippocampus,
   accompanied by reduced acetylation and elevated trimethylation of H3K9
   at the corresponding promoter. These effects were reversed completely by
   daily administration of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium
   butyrate for 1 wk after stress. H3K9 hypoacetylation was associated with
   a selective, sodium butyrate-reversible promoter accumulation of HDAC4.
   Hippocampal suppression of HDAC4 in vivo completely abolished the
   long-lasting AChE-related and behavioral stress effects. Our findings
   demonstrate long-lasting stress-inducible changes in AChE's promoter
   choices, identify the chromatin changes that support this long-term
   transcriptional memory, and reveal HDAC4 as a mediator of these effects
   in the hippocampus.

TI Exposure to dexamethasone during late gestation causes female-specific
   decreases in core body temperature and prepro-thyrotropin-releasing
   hormone expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in
   rats
SO PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
AB Synthetic glucocorticoids (GC) have been used to promote lung
   development in preterm infants, thereby decreasing respiratory distress
   syndrome and mortality, yet, concern has arisen from reports that such
   treatment predisposes individuals to disease in adulthood. Given the
   variety of preclinical studies that show metabolic and behavioral
   abnormalities in adulthood following fetal exposure to synthetic GC, we
   examined the effect of in utero exposure to the synthetic GC,
   dexamethasone (DEX), on hypothalamic expression of thyrotropin-releasing
   hormone (TRH) a central neuropeptide involved in mediating behavior and
   metabolic balance. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 0.4
   mg/kg DEX on gestational days 18-21. As adults (postnatal day (PD) 60),
   the offspring were fitted with temperature sensing transmitters allowing
   real-time monitoring of core body temperature (CBT) across the 24 h
   light dark period. This revealed a significant decrease in CBT
   throughout the day in prenatal DEX-treated females on estrus and
   diestrus, but not in male offspring. The reduction in CBT by prenatal
   DEX,exposure was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression
   of Trh transcript in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
   (PVN) of female rats at PD 60 and this effect was also present on PD7.
   There was also a female-specific reduction in the number of
   preproTRH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the PVN, with ppTRH-ir nerve
   fibers decreases that were present in both male and female offspring. No
   changes in thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, 13; thyroxine, 14) were
   observed in adult offspring, but during development, both males and
   females (PD14) had lower T3 and 14 levels. These data indicate abnormal
   expression of TRH results from fetal DEX exposure during late gestation,
   possibly explaining the decreased CBT observed in the-female offspring.

TI Case-control study of HLA-G promoter methylation status, HPV infection
   and cervical neoplasia in Curitiba, Brazil: a pilot analysis
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: The causal association between persistent human
   papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer has been established,
   but the mechanisms that favor HPV persistence in cervical cells are
   still unknown. The diminished capability of the immune system to control
   and resolve HPV infection is one of several hypotheses. The tolerogenic
   protein HLA-G has shown aberrant expression in a variety of cancers,
   which has been suggested as a mechanism for tumor escape from
   immunosurveillance. In the present study we evaluate the role of
   epigenetic modification (promoter de-methylation) of the HLA-G gene on
   susceptibility to HPV infection and development of high-grade cervical
   lesions.
   Methods: A case-control study was carried out in Curitiba, Brazil,
   between February and June 2010. A total of 789 women aged 15-47 years
   were recruited: 510 controls with normal cervical cytology, and 279
   cases with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
   grade 2 (CIN2, N = 150) or grade 3 (CIN3, N = 129). All women were
   administered a questionnaire by interview, which collected information
   on demographic and lifestyle factors, and a cervical sample was
   collected. HPV DNA detection was performed by GP5+/GP6+ primer-mediated
   PCR. HPV-positive samples were genotyped by multiplex PCR. A pilot
   analysis of HLA-G promoter methylation was carried out in a subset of
   the study population (96 cases and 76 controls) by pyrosequencing. HLA-G
   methylation and HPV infection status of cases and controls were
   compared, and confounding factors were computed by t Student and
   non-parametric Wilcoxon tests. Comparison of HLA-G methylation between
   cases and controls was assessed by the Bonferroni correction. The
   association of HLA-G methylation with CIN2/3 was evaluated by logistic
   regression.
   Results: HPV prevalence was 19.6% in controls and 94.3% in CIN2/3 cases.
   HPV16, 31, 33, 35 and 18 were the most prevalent types. Methylation
   analysis of seven CpGs in the HLA-G promoter did not reveal any
   spontaneous de-methylation events in CIN2/3 cases (mean proportion of
   methylation: 75.8%) with respect to controls (mean 73.7%; odds ratio
   1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.96, 1.07).
   Conclusions: This study did not support the hypothesis that spontaneous
   de-methylation events in the HLA-G promoter play a primary role in
   promoting escape from immunosurveillance in the development of
   precancerous cervical lesions.

TI Foxa2 and H2A.Z Mediate Nucleosome Depletion during Embryonic Stem Cell
   Differentiation
SO CELL
AB Nucleosome occupancy is fundamental for establishing chromatin
   architecture. However, little is known about the relationship between
   nucleosome dynamics and initial cell lineage specification. Here, we
   determine the mechanisms that control global nucleosome dynamics during
   embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation into endoderm. Both nucleosome
   depletion and de novo occupation occur during the differentiation
   process, with higher overall nucleosome density after differentiation.
   The variant histone H2A.Z and the winged helix transcription factor
   Foxa2 both act to regulate nucleosome depletion and gene activation,
   thus promoting ES cell differentiation, whereas DNA methylation promotes
   nucleosome occupation and suppresses gene expression. Nucleosome
   depletion during ES cell differentiation is dependent on Nap1l1-coupled
   SWI/SNF and INO80 chromatin remodeling complexes. Thus, both epigenetic
   and genetic regulators cooperate to control nucleosome dynamics during
   ES cell fate decisions.

TI MeCP2 Binds to 5hmC Enriched within Active Genes and Accessible
   Chromatin in the Nervous System
SO CELL
AB The high level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) present in neuronal
   genomes suggests that mechanisms interpreting 5hmC in the CNS may differ
   from those present in embryonic stem cells. Here, we present
   quantitative, genome-wide analysis of 5hmC, 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and
   gene expression in differentiated CNS cell types in vivo. We report that
   5hmC is enriched in active genes and that, surprisingly, strong
   depletion of 5mC is observed over these regions. The contribution of
   these epigenetic marks to gene expression depends critically on cell
   type. We identify methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the major
   5hmC-binding protein in the brain and demonstrate that MeCP2 binds 5hmC-
   and 5mC-containing DNA with similar high affinities. The
   Rett-syndrome-causing mutation R133C preferentially inhibits 5hmC
   binding. These findings support a model in which 5hmC and MeCP2
   constitute a cell-specific epigenetic mechanism for regulation of
   chromatin structure and gene expression.

TI The Effect of DNA CpG Methylation on the Dynamic Conformation of a
   Nucleosome
SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that is known to induce
   chromatin condensation and gene silencing. We used a time-domain
   fluorescence lifetime measurement to quantify the effects of DNA
   hypermethylation on the conformation and dynamics of a nucleosome.
   Nucleosomes reconstituted on an unmethylated and a methylated DNA both
   exhibit dynamic conformations under physiological conditions. The DNA
   end breathing motion and the H2A-H2B dimer destabilization dominate the
   dynamic behavior of nucleosomes at low to medium ionic strength.
   Extensive DNA CpG methylation, surprisingly, does not help to restrain
   the DNA breathing motion, but facilitates the formation of a more open
   nucleosome conformation. The presence of the divalent cation, Mg(2+)
   essential for chromatin compaction, and the methyl donor molecule SAM,
   required for DNA methyltransferase reaction, facilitate the compaction
   of both types of nucleosomes. The difference between the unmethylated
   and the methylated nucleosome persists within a broad range of salt
   concentrations, but vanishes under high magnesium concentrations.
   Reduced DNA backbone rigidity due to the presence of methyl groups is
   believed to contribute to the observed structural and dynamic
   differences. The observation of this study suggests that DNA methylation
   alone does not compact chromatin at the nucleosomal level and provides
   molecular details to understand the regulatory role of DNA methylation
   in gene expression.

TI CTCF/cohesin-mediated DNA looping is required for protocadherin alpha
   promoter choice
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The closely linked human protocadherin (Pcdh) alpha, beta, and gamma
   gene clusters encode 53 distinct protein isoforms, which are expressed
   in a combinatorial manner to generate enormous diversity on the surface
   of individual neurons. This diversity is a consequence of stochastic
   promoter choice and alternative pre-mRNA processing. Here, we show that
   Pcdh alpha promoter choice is achieved by DNA looping between two
   downstream transcriptional enhancers and individual promoters driving
   the expression of alternate Pcdha isoforms. In addition, we show that
   this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex
   to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally
   active promoters and in one of the enhancers. These findings have
   important implications regarding enhancer/promoter interactions in the
   generation of complex Pcdh cell surface codes for the establishment of
   neuronal identity and self-avoidance in individual neurons.

TI Haloperidol induces demethylation and expression of the dual specificity
   phosphatase 6 gene in MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells
SO LIFE SCIENCES
AB Aims: The effects of antipsychotics on various gene expressions through
   change in DNA methylation have been reported. Dual-specificity
   phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) is an extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2
   (ERK1/2)-selective phosphatase, and its expression can be suppressed by
   intronic methylation. Antipsychotic agent haloperidol affects ERK1/2
   activity and could induce changes in DNA methylation as well as histone
   acetylation. In this study, we examined the effects of haloperidol on
   DUSP6 expression related to DNA methylation changes.
   Main methods: The effects of haloperidol and 5-azacytidine, a
   demethylating agent, on expression and methylation of DUSP6 were
   quantitatively measured in MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells,
   in which DUSP6 expression is suppressed due to intronic
   hypermethylation. The growth rate of MIA PaCa-2 cells was also examined
   after treatment with haloperidol or 5-azacytidine.
   Key findings: Haloperidol increased DUSP6 expression in a
   concentration-dependent manner and inhibited MIA PaCa-2 cell
   proliferation: effects were comparable to those of 5-azacytidine.
   However, haloperidol did not induce DUSP6 expression in PANC-1 cells,
   another pancreatic cancer cell line without transcriptional suppression
   of DUSP6. Pyrosequencing methylation analysis confirmed the intronic
   hypermethylation of DUSP6 in MIA PaCa-2 and revealed that haloperidol
   and 5-azcytidine induced demethylation of CpG sequences in this region.
   Significance: Haloperidol induced DUSP6 expression related to intronic
   demethylation and inhibited MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation, which
   suggests demethylating activity and anti-cancer effects of haloperidol.
   These findings suggest the possible involvement of epigenetic regulatory
   mechanisms in the action mechanism of haloperidol. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Systemic Steroid Exposure Is Associated with Differential Methylation in
   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Rationale: Systemic glucocorticoids are used therapeutically to treat a
   variety of medical conditions. Epigenetic processes such as DNA
   methylation may reflect exposure to glucocorticoids and may be involved
   in mediating the responses and side effects associated with these
   medications.
   Objectives: To test the hypothesis that differences in DNA methylation
   are associated with current systemic steroid use.
   Methods: We obtained DNA methylation data at 27,578 CpG sites in 14,475
   genes throughout the genome in two large, independent cohorts: the
   International COPD Genetics Network (n(discovery) = 1,085) and the
   Boston Early Onset COPD study (n(replication) = 369). Sites were tested
   for association with current systemic steroid use using generalized
   linear mixed models.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 511 sites demonstrated
   significant differential methylation by systemic corticosteroid use in
   all three of our primary models. Pyrosequencing validation confirmed
   robust differential methylation at CpG sites annotated to genes such as
   SLC22A18, LRP3, HIPK3, SCNN1A, FXYD1, IRF7, AZU1, SIT1, GPR97, ABHD16B,
   and RABGEF1. Functional annotation clustering demonstrated significant
   enrichment in intrinsic membrane components, hemostasis and coagulation,
   cellular ion homeostasis, leukocyte and lymphocyte activation and
   chemotaxis, protein transport, and responses to nutrients.
   Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that systemic steroid use is
   associated with site-specific differential methylation throughout the
   genome. Differentially methylated CpG sites were found in biologically
   plausible and previously unsuspected pathways; these genes and pathways
   may be relevant in the development of novel targeted therapies.

TI Tandem PHD Fingers of MORF/MOZ Acetyltransferases Display Selectivity
   for Acetylated Histone H3 and Are Required for the Association with
   Chromatin
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB MORF [MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein)-related factor] and
   MOZ are catalytic subunits of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes
   essential in hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, skeletogenesis and other
   developmental programs and implicated in human leukemias. The canonical
   HAT domain of MORF/MOZ is preceded by a tandem of plant homeodomain
   (PHD) fingers whose biological roles and requirements for MORF/MOZ
   activity are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the tandem PHD1/2
   fingers of MORF recognize the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Acetylation
   of Lys9 (H3K9ac) or Lys14 (H3K14ac) enhances binding of MORF PHD1/2 to
   unmodified H3 peptides twofold to threefold. The selectivity for
   acetylated H3 tail is conserved in the double PHD1/2 fingers of MOZ.
   This interaction requires the intact N-terminus of histone H3 and is
   inhibited by trimethylation of Lys4. Biochemical analysis using NMR,
   fluorescence spectroscopy and mutagenesis identified key amino acids of
   MORF PHD1/2 necessary for the interaction with histones. Fluorescence
   microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that both PHD
   fingers are required for binding to H3K14ac in vivo and localization to
   chromatin. The HAT assays indicate that the interaction with H3K14ac may
   promote enzymatic activity in trans. Together, our data suggest that the
   PHD1/2 fingers play a role in MOZ/MORF HATs association with the
   chromatic regions enriched in acetylated marks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Transcription Factor Positive Regulatory Domain 4 (PRDM4) Recruits
   Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) to Mediate Histone Arginine
   Methylation and Control Neural Stem Cell Proliferation and
   Differentiation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB During development of the cerebral cortex, neural stem cells (NSCs)
   undergo a temporal switch from proliferative (symmetric) to
   neuron-generating (asymmetric) divisions. We investigated the role of
   Schwann cell factor 1 (SC1/PRDM4), a member of the PRDM family of
   transcription factors, in this critical transition. We discovered that
   SC1 recruits the chromatin modifier PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase
   that catalyzes symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 arginine 3
   (H4R3me2s) and that this modification is preferentially associated with
   undifferentiated cortical NSCs. Overexpressing SC1 in embryonic NSCs led
   to an increase in the number of Nestin-expressing precursors; mutational
   analysis of SC1 showed that this was dependent on recruitment of PRMT5.
   We found that SC1 protein levels are down-regulated at the onset of
   neurogenesis and that experimental knockdown of SC1 in primary NSCs
   triggers precocious neuronal differentiation. We propose that SC1 and
   PRMT5 are components of an epigenetic regulatory complex that maintains
   the "stem-like" cellular state of the NSC by preserving their
   proliferative capacity and modulating their cell cycle progression. Our
   findings provide evidence that histone arginine methylation regulates
   NSC differentiation.

TI In Vitro Transcription Activities of Pol IV, Pol V, and RDR2 Reveal
   Coupling of Pol IV and RDR2 for dsRNA Synthesis in Plant RNA Silencing
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB In Arabidopsis, RNA-dependent DNA methylation and transcriptional
   silencing involves three nuclear RNA polymerases that are biochemically
   undefined: the presumptive DNA-dependent RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol
   V and the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2. Here we
   demonstrate their RNA polymerase activities in vitro. Unlike Pol II,
   Pols IV and V require an RNA primer, are insensitive to alpha-amanitin,
   and differ in their ability to displace the nontemplate DNA strand
   during transcription. Biogenesis of 24 nt small interfering RNAs
   (siRNAs), which guide cytosine methylation to corresponding sequences,
   requires both Pol IV and RDR2, which physically associate in vivo.
   Whereas Pol IV does not require RDR2 for activity, RDR2 is nonfunctional
   in the absence of associated Pol IV. These results suggest that the
   physical and mechanistic coupling of Pol IV and RDR2 results in the
   channeled synthesis of double-stranded precursors for 24 nt siRNA
   biogenesis.

TI Lamin B Receptor Recognizes Specific Modifications of Histone H4 in
   Heterochromatin Formation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Inner nuclear membrane proteins provide a structural framework for
   chromatin, modulating transcription beneath the nuclear envelope. Lamin
   B receptor (LBR) is a classical inner nuclear membrane protein that
   associates with heterochromatin, and its mutations are known to cause
   Pelger-Huet anomaly in humans. However, the mechanisms by which LBR
   organizes heterochromatin remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that
   LBR represses transcription by binding to chromatin regions that are
   marked by specific histone modifications. The tudor domain (residues
   1-62) of LBR primarily recognizes histone H4 lysine 20 dimethylation and
   is essential for chromatin compaction, whereas the whole nucleoplasmic
   region (residues 1-211) is required for transcriptional repression. We
   propose a model in which the nucleoplasmic domain of LBR tethers
   epigenetically marked chromatin to the nuclear envelope and
   transcriptional repressors are loaded onto the chromatin through their
   interaction with LBR.

TI ANKRD18A as a novel epigenetic regulation gene in lung cancer
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality
   worldwide. Effective early diagnosis and targeted therapies for lung
   cancer to reduce incidence and mortality would benefit from a better
   understanding of the key molecular changes that occur from normal to
   malignant tumor cells during lung cancer initiation and development, but
   these are largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that DNA
   methylation, an important mechanism for the regulation of gene
   expression, plays a key role in lung carcinogenesis. In this study, we
   screened a novel methylation gene. ANKRD18A, encoding ankyrin repeat
   domain 18A, to determine whether it is regulated by DNA methylation in
   lung cancer. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR were
   used to analyze gene methylation status, and real-time quantitative
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) examined mRNA
   levels. Promoter hypermethylation of ANKRD18A was detected in 68.4%
   (26/38) of lung cancer tissues but not (0/20) in normal lung tissues (P
   < 0.01), whereas ANKRD18A mRNA expression was significantly decreased in
   lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. In addition,
   we found that ANKRD18A expression was significantly decreased in 9, of
   10 lung cancer cell lines. This was associated with hypermethylation of
   the ANKRD18A promoter region. Moreover, weak expression of ANKRD18A in
   methylated lung cancer cell lines increased markedly after treatment
   with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. These results
   suggest that ANKRD18A hypermethylation and consequent mRNA alterations
   might be a vital molecular mechanism in lung cancer. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI Tcra gene recombination is supported by a Tcra enhancer- and
   CTCF-dependent chromatin hub
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Antigen receptor locus V(D)J recombination requires interactions between
   widely separated variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene
   segments, but the mechanisms that generate these interactions are not
   well understood. Here we assessed mechanisms that direct developmental
   stage-specific long-distance interactions at the Tcra/Tcrd locus. The
   Tcra/Tcrd locus recombines Tcrd gene segments in CD4(-)CD8(-)
   double-negative thymocytes and Tcra gene segments in CD4(+)CD8(+)
   double-positive thymocytes. Initial V(alpha)-to-J(alpha) recombination
   occurs within a chromosomal domain that displays a contracted
   conformation in both thymocyte subsets. We used chromosome conformation
   capture to demonstrate that the Tcra enhancer (E(alpha)) interacts
   directly with V(alpha) and J(alpha) gene segments distributed across
   this domain, specifically in double-positive thymocytes. Moreover,
   E(alpha) promotes interactions between these V(alpha) and J(alpha)
   segments that should facilitate their synapsis. We found that the
   CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binds to E(alpha) and to many locus
   promoters, biases E(alpha) to interact with these promoters, and is
   required for efficient V(alpha)-J(alpha) recombination. Our data
   indicate that E(alpha) and CTCF cooperate to create a developmentally
   regulated chromatin hub that supports V(alpha)-J(alpha) synapsis and
   recombination.

TI Aberrant methylation of the M-type phospholipase A(2) receptor gene in
   leukemic cells
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: The M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R1) plays a
   crucial role in several signaling pathways and may act as
   tumor-suppressor. This study examined the expression and methylation of
   the PLA2R1 gene in Jurkat and U937 leukemic cell lines and its
   methylation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute
   leukemia.
   Methods: Sites of methylation of the PLA2R1 locus were identified by
   sequencing bisulfite-modified DNA fragments. Methylation specific-high
   resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis was then carried out to quantify
   PLA2R1 methylation at 5'-CpG sites identified with differences in
   methylation between healthy control subjects and leukemic patients using
   sequencing of bisulfite-modified genomic DNA.
   Results: Expression of PLA2R1 was found to be completely down-regulated
   in Jurkat and U937 cells, accompanied by complete methylation of PLA2R1
   promoter and down-stream regions; PLA2R1 was re-expressed after exposure
   of cells to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. MS-HRM analysis of the PLA2R1 locus
   in patients with different types of leukemia indicated an average
   methylation of 28.9% +/- 17.8%, compared to less than 9% in control
   subjects. In MDS patients the extent of PLA2R1 methylation significantly
   increased with disease risk. Furthermore, measurements of PLA2R1
   methylation appeared useful for predicting responsiveness to the
   methyltransferase inhibitor, azacitidine, as a pre-emptive treatment to
   avoid hematological relapse in patients with high-risk MDS or acute
   myeloid leukemia.
   Conclusions: The study shows for the first time that PLA2R1 gene
   sequences are a target of hypermethylation in leukemia, which may have
   pathophysiological relevance for disease evolution in MDS and
   leukemogenesis.

TI Transcription in the Absence of Histone H3.2 and H3K4 Methylation
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB Histone H3 proteins play fundamental roles in DNA packaging, gene
   transcription, and the transmission of epigenetic states. In addition to
   posttranslational modifications of their N termini, the use of H3
   variants contributes to their regulatory repertoire. Canonical histone
   H3.2 is expressed during S phase and differs by four amino acid residues
   from the variant histone H3.3, which is synthesized in a
   cell-cycle-independent manner [1]. Because H3.3 is enriched within
   actively transcribed loci [1-3], and because di- and trimethylation of
   H3 lysine 4 are hallmarks of chromatin at such sites in the genome [4],
   the H3.3K4 residue is considered to serve as the major regulatory
   determinant for the transcriptional state of a gene. Here we use genetic
   approaches in Drosophila to replace all 46 gene copies of His3.2 with
   mutant derivatives and thereby demonstrate that canonical and variant H3
   can functionally replace each other. Cells are able to divide and
   differentiate when H3.2 is entirely absent but replaced by S
   phase-expressed H3.3. Moreover, although slowed down in their
   proliferative capacity, cells that code for a nonmethylatable residue
   instead of K4 in all canonical and variant H3 genes are competent to
   respond to major developmental signaling pathways by activating target
   gene expression. Hence, the presence of different H3 protein species is
   not essential in Drosophila and transcriptional regulation can occur in
   the complete absence of H3K4 methylation.

SO NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB The progressive and latent nature of neurodegenerative diseases, such as
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates the role of epigenetic modification
   in disease susceptibility. Previous studies from our lab show that
   developmental exposure to lead (Pb) perturbs the expression of

   methylation as an epigenetic modifications mechanism in gene expression
   regulation, an integrative study of global gene expression and
   methylation profiles is essential. Given the different formats of gene
   expression and methylation data, combining these data for integrative
   analysis can be challenging. In this paper we describe a method to
   integrate and analyze gene expression and methylation arrays.
   Methylation array raw data contain the signal intensities of each probe
   of CpG sites, whereas gene expression data measure the signal intensity
   values of genes. In order to combine these data, methylation data of CpG

SO HERPETOLOGICA
AB Understanding the relationship between climate-driven habitat conditions
   and survival is key to preserving biodiversity in the face of rapid
   climate change. Hydroperiod-the length of time water is in a wetland-is
   a critical limiting habitat variable for amphibians as larvae must
   metamorphose before ponds dry. Changes in precipitation and temperature

   using individuals collected from ponds spanning a range of natural
   hydroperiods (Colorado Front Range, USA). To assess the effects of
   experimental hydroperiod reduction, we measured mortality, time to
   metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis. We found that tadpoles grew at
   rates reflecting the hydroperiods of their native ponds, regardless of
   experimental treatment. Tadpoles from permanent ponds metamorphosed
   faster than those from ephemeral ponds across all experimental
   treatments, a pattern which may represent a predation selection gradient
   or countergradient variation in developmental rates. Size at
   metamorphosis did not vary across experimental treatments. Mortality was
   low overall but varied with pond of origin. Our results suggest that
   adaptation to local hydroperiod and/or predation and temperature
   conditions is important in P. maculate. Moreover, the lack of a plastic
   response to reduced hydroperiods suggests that P. maculate may not be
   able to metamorphose quickly enough to escape drying ponds. These
   results have important implications for amphibian persistence in ponds
   predicted to dry more quickly due to rapid climate change.

TI Evaluation of single CpG sites as proxies of CpG island methylation
   states at the genome scale
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Methylation of a CpG island is a faithful marker of silencing of its
   associated gene. Different approaches report the methylation status of a
   CpG island based on the determination of one or a few CpG sites by
   assuming the homogeneity of methylation along the element. This strategy
   is frequently applied in both locus-specific and genome-wide studies,
   but often without a validation of the representativeness of the
   interrogated CpG site compared with the whole element. We have evaluated
   the predictive informativeness of the HpaII sites located in CpG islands
   using data from high-resolution methylome maps, which offer the
   possibility to assess the methylation homogeneity of each CpG island and
   to determine the reporter accuracy of single sites as surrogate markers.
   An excellent correlation was observed between the HpaII and CpG island
   methylation levels (r > 0.93). At the qualitative level, the predictive
   sensitivity of HpaII was >95% with >92% specificity for methylated CpG
   islands and >90% sensitivity with >95% specificity for unmethylated CpG
   islands. This analysis provides a global validation framework for
   strategies based on the use of the methylation-sensitive HpaII
   restriction enzyme.

TI Pmt1, a Dnmt2 homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, mediates tRNA
   methylation in response to nutrient signaling
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe carries a cytosine
   5-methyltransferase homolog of the Dnmt2 family (termed pombe
   methyltransferase 1, Pmt1), but contains no detectable DNA methylation.
   Here, we found that Pmt1, like other Dnmt2 homologs, has in vitro
   methylation activity on cytosine 38 of tRNA(Asp) and, to a lesser
   extent, of tRNA(Glu), despite the fact that it contains a non-consensus
   residue in catalytic motif IV as compared with its homologs. In vivo
   tRNA methylation also required Pmt1. Unexpectedly, however, its in vivo
   activity showed a strong dependence on the nutritional status of the
   cell because Pmt1-dependent tRNA methylation was induced in cells grown
   in the presence of peptone or with glutamate as a nitrogen source.
   Furthermore, this induction required the serine/threonine kinase Sck2,
   but not the kinases Sck1, Pka1 or Tor1 and was independent of glucose
   signaling. Taken together, this work reveals a novel connection between
   nutrient signaling and tRNA methylation that thus may link tRNA
   methylation to processes downstream of nutrient signaling like ribosome
   biogenesis and translation initiation.

TI The goitrogenic efficiency of thioamides in a marine teleost, sea bream
   (Sparus auratus)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Studies on the role of thyroid hormones (THs) in teleost fish physiology
   have deployed the synthetic goitrogens, methimazol (MMI),
   propilthiouracil (PTU) and thiourea (TU) that are used to treat human
   hyperthyroidism. However, the action of the goitrogens, MMI, PTU and TU
   at different levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in
   teleosts is largely unknown. The central importance of the hypothalamus
   and pituitary in a number of endocrine regulated systems and the
   cross-talk that occurs between different endocrine axes makes it
   pertinent to characterize the effects of MMI, PTU and TU, on several
   endpoints of the thyroid system. The marine teleost, sea bream (Sparus
   auratus) was exposed to MMI, PTU and TU (1 mg/kg wet weight per day),
   via the diet for 21 days. Radioimmunoassays (RIA) of plasma THs and
   ELISA of the TH carrier transthyretin (TTR) revealed that MMI was the
   only chemical that significantly reduced plasma TH levels (p <0.05).
   although both MMI and PTU significantly (p <0.05) reduced plasma levels
   of circulating TTR (p <0.05). Histological analysis of the thyroid
   tissue revealed modifications in thyrocyte activity that explain the
   reduced circulating levels of THs. MMI also significantly (p < 0.05)
   up-regulated transcript abundance of liver deiodinase 1 and 2 while
   significantly (p <0.05) decreasing TR beta expression in the pituitary,
   all hallmarks of HPT axis action of goitrogens in vertebrates. The
   results indicate that in the sea bream MMI is the most effective
   goitrogen followed by PTU and that TU (1 mg/kg wet weight for 21 days)
   failed to have a goitrogenic effect. The study highlights the
   non-uniform effect of goitrogens on the thyroid axis of sea bream and
   provides the basis for future studies of thyroid disrupting pollutants.

TI Associations between Arsenic Exposure and Global Posttranslational
   Histone Modifications among Adults in Bangladesh
SO CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
AB Background: Exposure to arsenic (As) is associated with an increased
   risk of several cancers as well as cardiovascular disease, and childhood
   neuro-developmental deficits. Arsenic compounds are weakly mutagenic,
   alter gene expression and posttranslational histone modifications
   (PTHMs) in vitro.
   Methods: Water and urinary As concentrations as well as global levels of
   histone 3 lysine 9 di-methylation and acetylation (H3K9me2 and H3K9ac),
   histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylation and acetylation (H3K27me3 and
   H3K27ac), histone 3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac), and histone 3
   lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) were measured in peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a subset of participants (N = 40) of a
   folate clinical trial in Bangladesh (FACT study).
   Results: Total urinary As (uAs) was positively correlated with H3K9me2
   (r = 0.36, P = 0.02) and inversely with H3K9ac (r = -0.47, P = 0.002).
   The associations between As and other PTHMs differed in a
   gender-dependent manner. Water As (wAs) was positively correlated with
   H3K4me3 (r = 0.45, P = 0.05) and H3K27me3 (r = 0.50, P = 0.03) among
   females and negatively correlated among males (H3K4me3: r = -0.44, P =
   0.05; H3K27me3: r = -0.34, P = 0.14). Conversely, wAs was inversely
   associated with H3K27ac among females (r = -0.44, P = 0.05) and
   positively associated among males (r = 0.29, P = 0.21). A similar
   pattern was observed for H3K18ac (females: r = -0.22, P = 0.36; males: r
   = 0.27, P = 0.24).
   Conclusion: Exposure to As is associated with alterations of global
   PTHMs; gender-specific patterns of association were observed between As
   exposure and several histone marks.
   Impact: These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence
   linking As exposure to epigenetic dysregulation, which may play a role
   in the pathogenesis of As toxicity. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev;

TI A chemoprotective fish oil/pectin diet enhances apoptosis via Bcl-2
   promoter methylation in rat azoxymethane-induced carcinomas
SO EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB We have demonstrated that diets containing fish oil and pectin (FO/P)
   reduce colon tumor incidence relative to control (corn oil and cellulose
   [CO/C]) in part by inducing apoptosis of DNA-damaged colon cells.
   Relative to FO/P, CO/C promotes colonocyte expression of the
   antiapoptotic modulator, Bcl-2, and Bcl-2 promoter methylation is
   altered in colon cancer. To determine if FO/P, compared with CO/C,
   limits Bcl-2 expression by enhancing promoter methylation in colon
   tumors, we examined Bcl-2 promoter methylation, mRNA levels, colonocyte
   apoptosis and colon tumor incidence in azoxymethane (AOM)-injected rats.
   Rats were provided diets containing FO/P or CO/C, and were terminated 16
   and 34 weeks after AOM injection. DNA isolated from
   paraformaldehyde-fixed colon tumors and uninvolved tissue was bisulfite
   modified and amplified by quantitative reverese transcriptase-polymerase
   chain reaction to assess DNA methylation in Bcl-2 cytosine-guanosine
   islands. FO/P increased Bcl-2 promoter methylation (P = 0.009) in tumor
   tissues and colonocyte apoptosis (P = 0.020) relative to CO/C. An
   inverse correlation between Bcl-2 DNA methylation and Bcl-2 mRNA levels
   was observed in the tumors. We conclude that dietary FO/P promotes
   apoptosis in part by enhancing Bcl-2 promoter methylation. These Bcl-2
   promoter methylation responses, measured in vivo, contribute to our
   understanding of the mechanisms involved in chemoprevention of colon
   cancer by diets containing FO/P.

TI Suppression and recovery of BRCA1-mediated transcription by HP1 gamma
   via modulation of promoter occupancy
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Heterochromatin protein 1 gamma (HP1 gamma) is a chromatin protein
   involved in gene silencing. Herein, we show that HP1 gamma interacts
   with breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and regulates
   BRCA1-mediated transcription via modulation of promoter occupancy and
   histone modification. We used several HP1 gamma mutants and small
   interfering RNAs for histone methyltransferases to show that BRCA1-HP1
   gamma interaction, but not methylated histone binding, is important in
   HP1 gamma repression of BRCA1-mediated transcription. Time-lapse studies
   on promoter association and histone methylation after DNA damage
   revealed that HP1 gamma accumulates at the promoter before DNA damage,
   but BRCA1 is recruited at the promoter after the damage while
   promoter-resident HP1 gamma is disassembled. Importantly, HP1 gamma
   assembly recovers after release from the damage in a BRCA1-HP1 gamma
   interaction-dependent manner and targets SUV39H1. HP1 gamma/SUV39H1
   restoration at the promoter results in BRCA1 disassembly and histone
   methylation, after which transcription repression resumes. We propose
   that through interaction with BRCA1, HP1 gamma is guided to the BRCA1
   target promoter during recovery and functions in the
   activation-repression switch and recovery from BRCA1-mediated
   transcription in response to DNA damage.

TI Spreading of Heterochromatin Is Limited to Specific Families of Maize
   Retrotransposons
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Transposable elements (TEs) have the potential to act as controlling
   elements to influence the expression of genes and are often subject to
   heterochromatic silencing. The current paradigm suggests that
   heterochromatic silencing can spread beyond the borders of TEs and
   influence the chromatin state of neighboring low-copy sequences. This
   would allow TEs to condition obligatory or facilitated epialleles and
   act as controlling elements. The maize genome contains numerous families
   of class I TEs (retrotransposons) that are present in moderate to high
   copy numbers, and many are found in regions near genes, which provides
   an opportunity to test whether the spreading of heterochromatin from
   retrotransposons is prevalent. We have investigated the extent of
   heterochromatin spreading into DNA flanking each family of
   retrotransposons by profiling DNA methylation and di-methylation of
   lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me2) in low-copy regions of the maize genome.
   The effects of different retrotransposon families on local chromatin are
   highly variable. Some retrotransposon families exhibit enrichment of
   heterochromatic marks within 800-1,200 base pairs of insertion sites,
   while other families exhibit very little evidence for the spreading of
   heterochromatic marks. The analysis of chromatin state in genotypes that
   lack specific insertions suggests that the heterochromatin in low-copy
   DNA flanking retrotransposons often results from the spreading of
   silencing marks rather than insertion-site preferences. Genes located
   near TEs that exhibit spreading of heterochromatin tend to be expressed
   at lower levels than other genes. Our findings suggest that a subset of
   retrotransposon families may act as controlling elements influencing
   neighboring sequences, while the majority of retrotransposons have
   little effect on flanking sequences.

TI Nestling corticosterone response to microclimate in an altricial bird
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE
AB Although altricial young are dependent on their parents during early
   life, they must respond to environmental variation to maintain
   homeostasis. The hormone corticosterone (CORT) may be an important link
   between environment and phenotype during early life; however, no
   previous study has experimentally assessed the sensitivity of CORT to
   nest microclimate in altricial birds beginning to thermoregulate. We
   tested the hypothesis that microclimate influences CORT by
   cross-fostering nestling Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor (Vieillot,
   1808)) between thicker-walled "aspen" nest boxes and thinner-walled
   "plywood" nest boxes. Quantification of CORT in nestling feathers
   allowed us to consider hormone secreted over days, rather than
   instantaneously from blood samples. In agreement with our hypothesis, we
   detected significant positive relationships between feather CORT and
   increased temperature variability and maximum, but not minimum, nest box
   temperatures. This could reflect the energetic challenge of warmer
   temperatures or positive developmental effects on the nestling
   hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. Feather CORT was significantly
   lower in chicks hatched in aspen nest boxes compared with plywood ones,
   but cross-fostering did not influence nestling CORT. This suggests that
   the influence of natal nest box environment on feather CORT was likely
   greater than the influence of the foster nest box environment. The
   relationships we detected highlight the sensitivity of feather CORT to
   environmental variation and contribute insight into nestling responses
   to environmental change.

TI Nucleic acid modifications with epigenetic significance
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression without alterations
   to the underlying nucleic acid sequence. In addition to the well-known
   5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine
   (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) have recently been discovered in
   genomic DNA, which all result from iterative oxidation of 5mC by the TET
   (Ten-Eleven-Translocate) family of enzymes. Recent studies have proposed
   the roles of these oxidized cytosines in mediating active demethylation
   of 5mC. Through affinity-based genome-wide sequencing and
   oxidation-assisted base-resolution sequencing methods, 5hmC is found to
   be dynamically regulated during development, and is enriched mainly in
   distal regulatory elements in human and mouse embryonic cells. Among RNA
   modifications, N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a widespread yet poorly
   studied base modification in mRNA and non-coding RNA. The recent
   discovery that m(6)A in RNA is the major substrate of the fat mass and
   obesity associated (FTO) protein draws attention to the potential
   regulatory functions of reversible RNA methylations, which can be
   dynamic, and could be important in many fundamental cellular functions.

TI Scriptaid and 5-aza-2 ' deoxycytidine Enhanced Expression of Pluripotent
   Genes and in vitro Developmental Competence in Interspecies Black-Footed
   Cat Cloned Embryos
SO REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB Contents Somatic cell nuclear transfer offers the possibility of
   preserving endangered species including the black-footed cat, which is
   threatened with extinction. The effectiveness and efficiency of somatic
   cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) depends on a variety of factors, but
   inappropriate epigenetic reprogramming of the transplanted nucleus is
   the primary cause of the developmental failure of cloned embryos.
   Abnormal epigenetic events such as DNA methylation and histone
   modifications during SCNT perturb the expression of imprinted and
   pluripotent-related genes that, consequently, may result in foetal and
   neonatal abnormalities. We have demonstrated that pregnancies can be
   established after transfer of black-footed cat cloned embryos into
   domestic cat recipients, but none of the implanted embryos developed to
   term and the foetal failure has been associated to aberrant
   reprogramming in cloned embryos. There is growing evidence that
   modifying the epigenetic pattern of the chromatin template of both donor
   cells and reconstructed embryos with a combination of inhibitors of
   histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases results in enhanced gene
   reactivation and improved in vitro and in vivo developmental competence.
   Epigenetic modifications of the chromatin template of black-footed cat
   donor cells and reconstructed embryos with epigenetic-modifying
   compounds enhanced in vitro development, and regulated the expression of
   pluripotent genes, but these epigenetic modifications did not improve in
   vivo developmental competence.

TI The Diversity of Stemona Stilbenoids As a Result of Storage and Fungal
   Infection
SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS
AB In relation to their biogenetic origin, 68 Stemona stilbenoids have been
   grouped into four structural types and are listed in order of increasing
   substitution pattern. Besides different hydroxylations and
   methoxylations, the rare C-methylations of the aromatic rings represent
   a typical chemical feature of these compounds. The formation of
   phenylbenzofurans constitutes another important chemical character
   separating Stemona species into two groups consistent with morphological
   and DNA data. Fungal infection leads to an increasing accumulation of
   stilbenes, dihydrostilbenes, and phenylbenzofurans with unsubstituted
   A-rings, suggesting the ecological role of these compounds as
   phytoalexins. Further oxygenations and methylations of both rings are
   interpreted as a result of aging or the drying processes. Bioautographic
   tests on TLC plates and germ-tube inhibition assays in microwells
   against four different fungi exhibited antifungal activities for almost
   all stilbenoids tested. Some derivatives also showed effects against
   yeasts and bacteria. Further activities may also be seen as
   dormancy-inducing factors of Stemona species occurring in periodically
   dry habitats. A leucotriene biosynthesis inhibition assay using 15
   stilbenoids showed interesting structure-activity relationships, with
   more potent effects of some compounds than the commercial 5-lipoxygenase
   inhibitor zileuton being observed. Potential neuroprotective activities
   have been reported for three dihydrostilbene glucosides against
   6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SYSY
   cells.

   monomethylation (H3K9me1): Distribution and their association in
   regulating gene expression under hyperglycaemic/hyperinsulinemic
   conditions in 3T3 cells
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia are leading cause for the induction type
   2 diabetes and the role of post-translational histone modifications in
   dysregulating the expression of genes has emerged as potential important
   contributor in the progression of disease. The paradoxical nature of
   histone H3-Lysine 4 and Lysine 9 mono-methylation (H3K4me1 and H3K9me1)
   in both gene activation and repression motivated us to elucidate the
   functional relationship of these histone modifications in regulating
   expression of genes under hyperglycaemic/hyperinsulinemic condition.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) was
   performed with H3 acetylation, H3K4me1 and H3K9me1 antibody. CLUSTER
   analysis of ChIP-chip (Chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray
   analysis) data showed that mRNA expression and H3 acetylation/H3K4me1
   levels on genes were inversely correlated with H3K9me1 levels on the
   transcribed regions, after 30 min of insulin stimulation under
   hyperglycaemic condition. Interestingly, we provide first evidence
   regarding regulation of histone de/acetylases and de/methylases; Myst4,
   Jmjd2b, Aof1 and Set by H3Ac, H3K4me1 and H3K9me1 under
   hyperinsulinemic/hyperglycaemic condition. ChIP-qPCR analysis shows
   association of increased H3Ac/H3K4me1 and decreased levels of H3K9me1 in
   up regulation of Myst4, Jmjd2, Set and Aof1 genes. We further analyse
   promoter occupancy of histone modifications by ChIP walking and observed
   increased occupancy of H3Ac/H3K4me1 on promoter region (-1000 to -1) of
   active genes and H3K9me1 on inactive genes under
   hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic condition. To best of our knowledge this
   is the first report that shows regulation of chromatin remodelling genes
   by alteration in the occupancy of histone H3Ac/H3K4/K9me on both

TI The SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA Represses Abscisic Acid
   Responses in the Absence of the Stress Stimulus in Arabidopsis
SO PLANT CELL
AB The survival of plants as sessile organisms depends on their ability to
   cope with environmental challenges. Of key importance in this regard is
   the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA not only promotes seed
   dormancy but also triggers growth arrest in postgermination embryos that
   encounter water stress. This is accompanied by increased desiccation
   tolerance. Postgermination ABA responses in Arabidopsis thaliana are
   mediated in large part by the ABA-induced basic domain/leucine zipper
   transcription factor ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5). Here, we show that loss of
   function of the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM)
   causes ABA hypersensitivity during postgermination growth arrest. ABI5
   expression was derepressed in brm mutants in the absence of exogenous
   ABA and accumulated to high levels upon ABA sensing. This effect was
   likely direct; chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed BRM binding to the
   ABI5 locus. Moreover, loss of BRM activity led to destabilization of a
   nucleosome likely to repress ABI5 transcription. Finally, the abi5 null
   mutant was epistatic to BRM in postgermination growth arrest. In
   addition, vegetative growth defects typical of brm mutants in the
   absence of ABA treatment could be partially overcome by reduction of ABA
   responses, and brm mutants displayed increased drought tolerance. We
   propose a role for BRM in the balance between growth or stress
   responses.

TI Active behavioral coping alters the behavioral but not the endocrine
   response to stress
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Exposure to traumatic stressors typically causes lasting changes in
   emotionality and behavior. However, coping strategies have been shown to
   prevent and alleviate many stress consequences and the biological
   mechanisms that underlie coping are of great interest. Whereas the
   laboratory stressor inescapable tail-shock induces anxiety-like
   behaviors, here we demonstrate that permitting a rat to chew on a wooden
   dowel during administration of tail-shock prevented the development of
   anxiety like behaviors in the open field and juvenile social exploration
   tests. Uncontrollable stressors increase corticosterone and decrease
   thyroid hormone, and we hypothesized that coping would blunt these
   changes. While tail-shock did produce these effects, active coping did
   not alter hormone levels. The dissociation between behavioral resilience
   and circulating hormones is discussed with regard to the utility of
   these molecules as biomarkers for psychiatric disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI The effect of isoflurane anaesthesia and vasectomy on circulating
   corticosterone and ACTH in BALB/c mice
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The use of blood corticosterone and faecal corticosterone metabolites as
   biomarkers of post-surgical stress and pain in laboratory animals has
   increased during the last decade. However, many aspects of their
   reliability in laboratory mice remain uninvestigated. This study
   investigated serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
   in mice subjected to isoflurane anaesthesia and vasectomy, and mice
   subjected to isoflurane anaesthesia without surgery. Serum levels of
   corticosterone and ACTH after pretreatment with dexamethasone were
   analysed to provide further information about the stress hormone
   profiles. Vasectomy resulted in an increase in corticosterone for at
   least four hours after surgery with a peak 30 min after the mice
   regained righting reflex. Mice subjected to isoflurane anaesthesia
   without surgery had the highest level of serum corticosterone 5 min
   after regained righting reflex and the level returned to baseline levels
   four hours after the procedure. In vasectomised mice, treated with
   dexamethasone, high levels of corticosterone remained 30 min after the
   procedure, whereas the anaesthetised mice, treated with dexamethasone,
   had significantly lower levels of corticosterone compared to
   anaesthetised mice not treated with dexamethasone. Thus, dexamethasone
   effectively inhibited the corticosterone response in the
   anaesthetised-only mice, but not in the mice subjected to surgery. In
   conclusion, both isoflurane anaesthesia and vasectomy during isoflurane
   anaesthesia resulted in an increase in serum glucocorticoids, but the
   negative feedback mechanism of newly operated mice, was altered. This
   may have consequences for the interpretation of glucocorticoids
   measurements as a biomarker of post-surgical stress in mice. (C) 2012

TI Effects of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus and Four Insecticides on Pacific
   Treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla)
SO JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
AB Chemical contamination may influence host-pathogen interactions, which
   has implications for amphibian population declines. We examined the
   effects of four insecticides alone or as a mixture on development and
   metamorphosis of Pacific Treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) in the presence
   or absence of the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis [Bd]). Bd exposure had a negative impact on tadpole
   activity, survival to metamorphosis, time to metamorphosis, and time of
   tail absorption (with a marginally negative effect on mass at
   metamorphosis); however, no individuals tested positive for Bd at
   metamorphosis. The presence of sublethal concentrations of insecticides
   alone or in a mixture did not impact Pacific Treefrog activity as
   tadpoles, survival to metamorphosis, or time and size to metamorphosis.
   Insecticide exposure did not influence the effect of Bd exposure. Our
   study did not support our prediction that effects of Bd would be greater
   in the presence of expected environmental concentrations of
   insecticide(s), but it did show that Bd had negative effects on
   responses at metamorphosis that could reduce the quality of juveniles
   recruited into the population.

TI The emerging role of DNA methylation in epileptogenesis
SO EPILEPSIA
AB DNA methylation is a covalent chromatin modification, characterized by
   the biochemical addition of a methyl group (-CH3) to cytosine
   nucleotides via a DNA methyltransferase enzyme. 5'-Methylcytosine
   (5-mC), frequently called the fifth base, has been implicated in genome
   stability, silencing of transposable elements, and repression of gene
   expression. Through the latter, DNA methylation dynamics broadly
   influence brain development, function, and aging. Aberrant DNA
   methylation patterns, either localized to specific gene regions or
   scattered throughout the genome, are associated with many neurologic
   disorders. Herein, we discuss the emerging role of DNA methylation in
   epileptogenesis and the perspectives arising from epigenetic medicine as
   new therapeutic strategy in difficult-to-treat epilepsies.

TI Concordance in hippocampal and fecal Nr3c1 methylation is moderated by
   maternal behavior in the mouse
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Recent advances in genomic technologies now enable a reunion of
   molecular and evolutionary biology. Researchers investigating naturally
   living animal populations are thus increasingly able to capitalize upon
   genomic technologies to connect molecular findings with multiple levels
   of biological organization. Using this vertical approach in the
   laboratory, epigenetic gene regulation has emerged as an important
   mechanism integrating genotype and phenotype. To connect phenotype to
   population fitness, however, this same vertical approach must now be
   applied to naturally living populations. A major obstacle to studying
   epigenetics in noninvasive samples is tissue specificity of epigenetic
   marks. Here, using the mouse as a proof-of-principle model, we present
   the first known attempt to validate an epigenetic assay for use in
   noninvasive samples. Specifically, we compare DNA methylation of the
   NGFI-A (nerve growth factor-inducible protein A) binding site in the
   promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) gene between central
   (hippocampal) and peripheral noninvasive (fecal) tissues in juvenile
   Balb/c mice that had received varying levels of postnatal maternal care.
   Our results indicate that while hippocampal DNA methylation profiles
   correspond to maternal behavior, fecal DNA methylation levels do not.
   Moreover, concordance in methylation levels between these tissues within
   individuals only emerges after accounting for the effects of postnatal
   maternal care. Thus, although these findings may be specific to the
   Nr3c1 gene, we urge caution when interpreting DNA methylation patterns
   from noninvasive tissues, and offer suggestions for further research in
   this field.

TI Protein arginine methylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB Recent research has implicated arginine methylation as a major regulator
   of cellular processes, including transcription, translation,
   nucleocytoplasmic transport, signalling, DNA repair, RNA processing and
   splicing. Arginine methylation is evolutionarily conserved, and it is
   now thought that it may rival other post-translational modifications
   such as phosphorylation in terms of its occurrence in the proteome. In
   addition, multiple recent examples demonstrate an exciting new theme:
   the interplay between methylation and other post-translational
   modifications such as phosphorylation. In this review, we summarize our
   current understanding of arginine methylation and the recent advances
   made, with a focus on the lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We
   cover the types of methylated proteins, their responsible
   methyltransferases, where and how the effects of arginine methylation
   are seen in the cell, and, finally, discuss the conservation of the
   biological function of methylarginines between S. cerevisiae and
   mammals.

TI Association of modified cytosines and the methylated DNA-binding protein
   MeCP2 with distinctive structural domains of lampbrush chromatin
SO CHROMOSOME RESEARCH
AB We have investigated the association of DNA methylation and proteins
   interpreting methylation state with the distinctive closed and open
   chromatin structural domains that are directly observable in the
   lampbrush chromosomes (LBCs) of amphibian oocytes. To establish the
   distribution in LBCs of MeCP2, one of the key proteins binding
   5-methylcytosine-modified DNA (5mC), we expressed HA-tagged MeCP2
   constructs in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Full-length MeCP2 was
   predominantly targeted to the closed, transcriptionally inactive
   chromomere domains in a pattern proportional to chromomeric DNA density
   and consistent with a global role in determining chromatin state. A
   minor fraction of HA-MeCP2 was also found to associate with a
   distinctive structural domain, namely a short region at the bases of
   some of the extended lateral loops. Expression in oocytes of deleted
   constructs and of point mutants derived from Rett syndrome patients
   demonstrated that the association of MeCP2 with LBCs was determined by
   its 5mC-binding domain. We also examined more directly the distribution
   of 5mC by immunostaining Xenopus and axolotl LBCs and confirmed the
   pattern suggested by MeCP2 targeting of intense staining of the
   chromomeres and of some loop bases. In addition, we found in the longer
   loops of axolotl LBCs that short interstitial regions could also be
   clearly stained for 5mC. These 5mC regions corresponded precisely to
   unusual segments of active transcription units from which RNA polymerase
   II (pol II) and nascent transcripts were simultaneously absent. We also
   examined by immunostaining the distribution in lampbrush chromatin of
   the oxidized 5mC derivative, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Although in
   general, the pattern resembled that obtained for 5mC, one antibody
   against 5hmC produced intense staining of restricted chromosomal foci.
   These foci corresponded to a third type of lampbrush chromatin domain,
   the transcriptionally active but less extended structures formed by
   clusters of genes transcribed by pol III. This raises the possibility
   that 5hmC may play a role in establishing the distinctive patterns of
   gene repression and activation that characterize specific pol
   III-transcribed gene families in amphibian genomes.

TI Inverse urinary corticosterone and testosterone metabolite responses to
   different durations of restraint in the cane toad (Rhinella marina)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Non-invasive measurement of urinary corticosterone and testosterone
   metabolites in amphibians provides opportunities for endocrine studies
   of responses to physiological and psychological stressors. Typically,
   corticosterone metabolite concentrations increase in frog urine within
   1-2 h of a mild capture and handling stress protocol. However, no study
   has investigated the effect of duration of manual restraint on the
   changes in corticosterone and reproductive hormones in amphibians. We
   quantified urinary corticosterone and testosterone metabolite responses
   for 8 h following various durations of manual restraint (control, 5, 15
   or 30 min) in adult male cane toads (Rhinella marina) under controlled
   laboratory conditions. All toads had a corticosterone stress response
   over 8 h to our standard capture and handling stressor. The mean
   corticosterone stress response was significantly higher after 15 or 30
   min restraint in comparison to the control (no restraint) or to 5 min
   restraint. Manual restraint for 5, 15 or 30 min caused a significant
   reduction in urinary testosterone concentrations over 8 h. We also
   provide a novel method of quantifying plasticity in corticosterone
   stress responses in amphibians with respect to restraint duration using
   the concept of a "reaction norm". The reaction norm, which was
   calculated as slope of the regression line of integrated corticosterone
   response against restraint duration, was 9.69 (pg corticosterone/mu g
   creatinine h)/min for male toads. In summary, corticosterone and
   testosterone responses to restraint are affected by restraint duration
   in male toads. Glucocorticoid reaction norms can be applied to study the
   change in physiological stress hormonal response with respect to
   restraint duration in other amphibian species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Effect of starvation, body size, and temperature on the onset of
   metamorphosis in Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica)
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE
AB We assessed the effects of starvation, body size, and water temperature
   on the onset of metamorphosis in leptocephali of Japanese eel (Anguilla
   japonica Temminck and Schlegel, 1846) as determined by the morphological
   criteria of proportion, preanal length, and body depth to total length.
   Leptocephali of mean total length 55.6 mm that had been reared in
   captivity for 241 days from hatching were divided into unfed (n=-28) and
   fed (n=30) groups in triplicate and reared for an additional 2 weeks.
   The mean percentage of larvae starting metamorphosis within 2 weeks was
   significantly higher in the unfed than in the fed groups (70% vs.
   28.6%), suggesting that food deprivation acted as a cue for
   metamorphosis. The critical size for metamorphosis was a total length of
   50-55 mm; smaller larvae did not start metamorphosis even in the absence
   of food, whereas larvae reaching that critical size were induced to
   undergo metamorphosis by starvation. The start of metamorphosis under
   unfed conditions was independent of diel-varying water temperature (day
   23 degrees C; night 21-29 degrees C), suggesting a high plasticity in
   response to a wide range of environmental temperatures. These findings
   suggest methods for the efficient production of glass eels, as well as
   new insights into the mechanism of eel metamorphosis.

TI DNA methylation differences in exposed workers and nearby residents of
   the Ma Ta Phut industrial estate, Rayong, Thailand
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background Adverse biological effects from airborne pollutants are a
   primary environmental concern in highly industrialized areas. Recent
   studies linked air pollution exposures with altered blood
   Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, but effects from industrial
   sources and underlying biological mechanisms are still largely
   unexplored.
   Methods The Ma Ta Phut industrial estate (MIE) in Rayong, Thailand hosts
   one of the largest steel, oil refinery and petrochemical complexes in
   south-eastern Asia. We measured a panel of blood DNA methylation markers
   previously associated with air pollution exposures, including repeated
   elements [long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and Alu] and
   genes [p53, hypermethylated-in-cancer-1 (HIC1), p16 and interleukin-6
   (IL-6)], in 67 MIE workers, 65 Ma Ta Phut residents and 45 rural
   controls. To evaluate the role of DNA damage and oxidation, we
   correlated DNA methylation measures with bulky DNA and
   3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentafuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2-alpha]purin-10(3H)
   -one deoxyguanosine (M(1)dG) adducts.
   Results In covariate-adjusted models, MIE workers, compared with rural
   residents, showed lower LINE-1 (74.8% vs 78.0%; P < 0.001), p53 (8.0% vs
   15.7%; P < 0.001) and IL-6 methylation (39.2% vs 45.0%; P = 0.027) and
   higher HIC1 methylation (22.2% vs 15.3%, P < 0.001). For all four
   markers, Ma Ta Phut residents exhibited methylation levels intermediate
   between MIE workers and rural controls (LINE-1, 75.7%, P < 0.001; p53,
   9.0%, P < 0.001; IL-6, 39.8%, P = 0.041; HIC1, 17.8%, P = 0.05; all
   P-values vs rural controls). Bulky DNA adducts showed negative
   correlation with p53 methylation (P = 0.01). M(1)dG showed negative
   correlations with LINE-1 (P = 0.003) and IL-6 methylation (P = 0.05).
   Conclusions Our findings indicate that industrial exposures may induce
   alterations of DNA methylation patterns detectable in blood leucocyte
   DNA. Correlation of DNA adducts with DNA hypomethylation suggests
   potential mediation by DNA damage.

TI Increase in Histone Methylation in the Cat Germinal Vesicle Related to
   Acquisition of Meiotic and Developmental Competence
SO REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB Contents This study identified specific changes in histone lysine
   methylation patterns of the feline germinal vesicle (GV) during
   pre-antral-to-antral follicle transition, the latter being a key
   interval for competence acquisition. Oocytes from adult cats were
   isolated from pre-antral, early (=0.5mm diameter), small (0.61mm) or
   large (13.5mm) antral follicles and immuno-stained with anti-histones H3
   trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), lysine 4 (H3K4me3), lysine 27
   (H3K27me3) or H3 dimethylated at lysine 79 (H3K79me2). The vast majority
   of oocytes (range, 72.285.4%; p>0.05) contained a GV with H3K9me3 or
   H3K27me3, regardless of follicular stage/size. However, the proportion
   of GVs with H3K4me3 or H3K79me2 was higher in early antral follicles
   (42.6%; p<0.05) compared with other stages (range, 12.115.2%).
   Therefore, H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 (both known to be associated with
   selective gene activation) appear to be reliable markers of onset of GV
   competence during the pre-antral-to-antral transition phase. By
   contrast, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (both known to be related to selective
   gene repression) seem more linked to expression patterns during the GV
   stage and are less useful indicators during the entire folliculogenesis
   interval.

   action at the molecular level in both of these processes based primarily
   on studies in the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, the flour beetle
   Tribolium castaneum, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and the fruit fly
   Drosophila melanogaster. The roles of the JH receptor complex and the

TI Distinct modes of DNA accessibility in plant chromatin
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins is a major property of
   the chromatin environment that favours or hinders transcription. Recent
   studies in flies reported that H3K9me2-marked heterochromatin is
   accessible while H3K27me3-marked chromatin forms extensive domains of
   low accessibility. Here we show that plants regulate DNA accessibility
   differently. H3K9me2-marked heterochromatin is the least accessible in
   the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and H3K27me3-marked chromatin also has
   low accessibility. We see that very long genes without H3K9me2 or
   H3K27me3 are often inaccessible and generated significantly lower
   amounts of antisense transcripts than other genes, suggesting that
   reduced accessibility is associated with reduced recognition of
   alternative promoters. Low accessibility of H3K9me2-marked
   heterochromatin and long genes depend on cytosine methylation,
   explaining why chromatin accessibility differs between plants and flies.
   Together, we conclude that restriction of DNA accessibility is a local
   property of chromatin and not necessarily a consequence of
   microscopically visible compaction.

TI Levels of DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation change
   in root tip cells of soybean seedlings grown at different temperatures
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In order to check whether changes in DNA and histone modifications occur
   in the nuclei of root tip cells of soybean seedlings grown 1) under
   control conditions (25 degrees C), 2) subjected to chilling stress (10
   degrees C) and 3) recovered (25 degrees C) after chilling, measurements
   of fluorescence intensity with the use of antibodies to heterochromatin
   as well as to euchromatin markers were carried out. Moreover, the number
   and sizes of chromocentres were analyzed. The studies showed that during
   chilling stress the fluorescence intensity for the markers
   characteristic of heterochromatin increased while for the markers of
   euchromatin decreased in comparison to the control. After the recovery
   the converse situation was observed, i.e. increase in fluorescence
   intensity for euchromatin markers and decrease in heterochromatin
   markers. The number of chromocentres remained unchanged in the nuclei of
   all three studied variants. However, differences in the sizes of
   chromocentres were observed - the highest number of big chromocentres
   and simultaneously the lowest number of small chromocentres were in the
   nuclei of stressed plants. Conversely - in the nuclei of recovered
   plants there were the lowest number of big chromocentres and the highest
   number of small ones. The treatment of seedlings with the inhibitors of
   DNA methylation (5-aza-dC) and histone deacetylation (NaBu) also caused

TI Telomere length homeostasis and telomere position effect on a linear
   human artificial chromosome are dictated by the genetic background
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Telomere position effect (TPE) is the influence of telomeres on
   subtelomeric epigenetic marks and gene expression. Previous studies
   suggested that TPE depends on genetic background. As these analyses were
   performed on different chromosomes, cell types and species, it remains
   unclear whether TPE represents a chromosome-rather than genetic
   background-specific regulation. We describe the development of a Linear
   Human Artificial Chromosome (L-HAC) as a new tool for telomere studies.
   The L-HAC was generated through the Cre-loxP-mediated addition of
   telomere ends to an existing circular HAC (C-HAC). As it can be
   transferred to genetically distinct cell lines and animal models the
   L-HAC enables the study of TPE in an unprecedented manner. The HAC was
   relocated to four telomerase-positive cell lines via microcell-mediated
   chromosome transfer and subsequently to mice via blastocyst injection of
   L-HAC(+)-ES-cells. We could show consistent genetic background-dependent
   adaptation of telomere length and telomere-associated de novo
   subtelomeric DNA methylation in mouse ES-R1 cells as well as in mice.
   Expression of the subtelomeric neomycin gene was inversely correlated
   with telomere length and subtelomeric methylation. We thus provide a new
   tool for functional telomere studies and provide strong evidence that
   telomere length, subtelomeric chromatin marks and expression of
   subtelomeric genes are genetic background dependent.

TI Epigenetic modifications and mRNA levels of the imprinted gene Grb10 in
   serially passaged fibroblast cells
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB The imprinted gene Grb10 influences fetal growth, adult behavior and
   tumor formation. Investigating this gene often involves consecutive
   passaging of cells in vitro. We analyzed changes in Grb10 DNA
   methylation and histone modifications in serially passaged adult mouse
   tail-tip fibroblast cells with bisulfite genomic sequencing method and
   chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) respectively. There was a
   significant reduction in global DNA methylation, but no changes in
   methylation at CpG island 1 (CGI1) of Grb10. There were no changes in
   methylation at histone H3K4me2, but less methylated histone H3K27me3 was
   detected, along with more of the acetylated histones H3Ac and H4Ac. The
   major-type transcript level of Grb10 in fibroblasts increased mildly
   after extended cultivation. These results suggest consecutive passaging
   may affect epigenetic modifications of Grb10 in adult fibroblast cells.

TI SuperTAG Methylation-specific Digital Karyotyping Reveals Uremia-induced
   Epigenetic Dysregulation of Atherosclerosis-Related Genes
SO CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR GENETICS
AB Background-Accelerated atherosclerosis is a hallmark of chronic kidney
   disease (CKD). Although the role of epigenetic dysregulation in
   atherosclerosis is increasingly appreciated, only a few studies focused
   on epigenetics in CKD-associated cardiovascular disease, virtually all
   of which assessed epigenetic dysregulation globally. We hypothesized
   that gene-specific epigenetic dysregulation in CKD exists, affecting
   genes pertinent to inflammation and atherosclerosis.
   Methods and Results-Ten clinically stable patients undergoing
   hemodialysis therapy and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were
   recruited. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed by
   SuperTAG methylation-specific digital karyotyping, in order to identify
   genes differentially methylated in CKD. Analysis of 27 043 436 tags
   revealed 4288 genomic loci with differential DNA methylation (P<10(-10))
   between hemodialysis patients and control subjects. Annotation of
   UniTags to promoter databases allowed us to identify 52 candidate genes
   associated with cardiovascular disease and 97 candidate genes associated
   with immune/infection diseases. These candidate genes could be
   classified to distinct proatherogenic processes, including lipid
   metabolism and transport (eg, HMGCR, SREBF1, LRP5, EPHX2, and FDPS),
   cell proliferation and cell-cycle regulation (eg, MIK67, TP53, and
   ALOX12), angiogenesis (eg, ANGPT2, ADAMTS10, and FLT4), and inflammation
   (eg, TNFSF10, LY96, IFNGR1, HSPA1A, and IL12RB1).
   Conclusions-We provide a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide
   epigenetic alterations in CKD, identifying candidate genes associated
   with proatherogenic and inflammatory processes. These results may spur
   further research in the field of epigenetics in kidney disease and point
   to new therapeutic strategies in CKD-associated atherosclerotic disease.

TI G9a functions as a molecular scaffold for assembly of transcriptional
   coactivators on a subset of Glucocorticoid Receptor target genes
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Histone H3 lysine-9 methyltransferase G9a/EHMT2/KMT1C is a key
   corepressor of gene expression. However, activation of a limited number
   of genes by G9a (independent of its catalytic activity) has also been
   observed, although the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. By
   using RNAi in combination with gene expression microarray analysis, we
   found that G9a functions as a positive and a negative transcriptional
   coregulator for discrete subsets of genes that are regulated by the
   hormone-activated Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). G9a was recruited to
   GR-binding sites (but not to the gene body) of its target genes and
   interacted with GR, suggesting recruitment of G9a by GR. In contrast to
   its corepressor function, positive regulation of gene expression by G9a
   involved G9a-mediated enhanced recruitment of coactivators CARM1 and
   p300 to GR target genes. Further supporting a role for G9a as a
   molecular scaffold for its coactivator function, the G9a-specific
   methyltransferase inhibitor UNC0646 did not affect G9a coactivator
   function but selectively decreased G9a corepressor function for
   endogenous target genes. Overall, G9a functioned as a coactivator for
   hormone-activated genes and as a corepressor in support of
   hormone-induced gene repression, suggesting that the positive or
   negative actions of G9a are determined by the gene-specific regulatory
   environment and chromatin architecture. These findings indicate distinct
   mechanisms of G9a coactivator vs. corepressor functions in
   transcriptional regulation and provide insight into the molecular
   mechanisms of G9a coactivator function. Our results also suggest a
   physiological role of G9a in fine tuning the set of genes that respond
   to glucocorticoids.

TI Ethanol extracts from Hemerocallis citrina attenuate the decreases of
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor, TrkB levels in rat induced by
   corticosterone administration
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hemerocallis citrina, a traditional
   herbal medicine, has been used for the improvement of behavioral and
   emotional status in Eastern-Asia countries.
   Aim of the study: Our previous studies have demonstrated that the
   ethanol extracts of H. citrina flowers (HCE) reversed the behavioral
   alterations and monoamine neurotransmitter dysfunctions in stressed
   mice. However, the relation of its antidepressant-like action with
   neurotrophic molecular expressions remains unknown.
   Materials and methods: To clarify this, we explored the effect of HCE
   (32.5, 65, 130 mg/kg, p.o.) on the behavior, brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (BDNF) and its receptor (TrkB) in depression-like rats induced by
   exogenous administration of the stress hormone corticosterone (40 mg/kg,
   s.c.).
   Results: It was observed that repeated administration of corticosterone
   induced an elevation on the serum corticosterone levels, which caused
   the abnormalities observed in the sucrose preference test and forced
   swimming test (FST). Administration of HCE (65 and 130 mg/kg) reversed
   the changes above and up-regulated the BDNF and TrkB receptor protein
   expressions in the brain region of frontal cortex and hippocampus.
   Conclusion: These findings confirm that HCE produce an
   antidepressant-like effect in corticosterone-induced depression-like
   model of rats and this effect is at least partly mediated by BDNF-TrkB
   signaling in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. (C) 2012 Elsevier

TI The SNF2 family ATPase LSH promotes phosphorylation of H2AX and
   efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB LSH, a protein related to the SNF2 family of chromatin-remodelling
   ATPases, is essential for the correct establishment of DNA methylation
   levels and patterns in plants and mammalian cells. However, some of the
   phenotypes resulting from LSH deficiency cannot be explained easily by
   defects in DNA methylation. Here we show that LSH-deficient mouse and
   human fibroblasts show reduced viability after exposure to ionizing
   radiation and repair DNA double-strand breaks less efficiently than
   wild-type cells. A more detailed characterisation of this phenotype
   revealed that, in the absence of LSH, the histone variant H2AX is not
   efficiently phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. This results in
   impaired recruitment of MDC1 and 53BP1 proteins to DNA double-strand
   breaks and compromises phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase CHK2.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ability of LSH to hydrolyse ATP is
   necessary for efficient phosphorylation of H2AX at DNA double-strand
   breaks and successful repair of DNA damage. Taken together, our data
   reveal a previously unsuspected role of LSH ATPase in the maintenance of
   genome stability in mammalian somatic cells, which is independent of its
   function in de novo DNA methylation during development.

TI KNOX1 is expressed and epigenetically regulated during in vitro
   conditions in Agave spp
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Background: The micropropagation is a powerful tool to scale up plants
   of economical and agronomical importance, enhancing crop productivity.
   However, a small but growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic
   mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can be
   affected under the in vitro conditions characteristic of
   micropropagation. Here, we tested whether the adaptation to different in
   vitro systems (Magenta boxes and Bioreactors) modified epigenetically
   different clones of Agave fourcroydes and A. angustifolia. Furthermore,
   we assessed whether these epigenetic changes affect the regulatory
   expression of KNOTTED1-like HOMEOBOX (KNOX) transcription factors.
   Results: To gain a better understanding of epigenetic changes during in
   vitro and ex vitro conditions in Agave fourcroydes and A. angustifolia,
   we analyzed global DNA methylation, as well as different histone
   modification marks, in two different systems: semisolid in Magenta boxes
   (M) and temporary immersion in modular Bioreactors (B). No significant
   difference was found in DNA methylation in A. fourcroydes grown in
   either M or B. However, when A. fourcroydes was compared with A.
   angustifolia, there was a two-fold difference in DNA methylation between
   the species, independent of the in vitro system used. Furthermore, we
   detected an absence or a low amount of the repressive mark H3K9me2 in ex
   vitro conditions in plants that were cultured earlier either in M or B.
   Moreover, the expression of AtqKNOX1 and AtqKNOX2, on A. fourcroydes and
   A. angustifolia clones, is affected during in vitro conditions.
   Therefore, we used Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) to know whether
   these genes were epigenetically regulated. In the case of AtqKNOX1, the
   H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 were affected during in vitro conditions in
   comparison with AtqKNOX2.
   Conclusions: Agave clones plants with higher DNA methylation during in
   vitro conditions were better adapted to ex vitro conditions. In
   addition, A. fourcroydes and A. angustifolia clones displayed
   differential expression of the KNOX1 gene during in vitro conditions,
   which is epigenetically regulated by the H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 marks. The
   finding of an epigenetic regulation in key developmental genes will make
   it important in future studies to identify factors that help to find
   climate-resistant micropropagated plants.

TI MAOA promoter methylation and susceptibility to carotid atherosclerosis:
   role of familial factors in a monozygotic twin sample
SO BMC MEDICAL GENETICS
AB Background: Atherosclerosis is a complex process involving both genetic
   and epigenetic factors. The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene regulates
   the metabolism of key neurotransmitters and has been associated with
   cardiovascular risk factors. This study investigates whether MAOA
   promoter methylation is associated with atherosclerosis, and whether
   this association is confounded by familial factors in a monozygotic (MZ)
   twin sample.
   Methods: We studied 84 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs drawn from the
   Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was
   measured by ultrasound. DNA methylation in the MAOA promoter region was
   quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing using genomic DNA isolated from
   peripheral blood leukocytes. The association between DNA methylation and
   IMT was first examined by generalized estimating equation, followed by
   matched pair analyses to determine whether the association was
   confounded by familial factors.
   Results: When twins were analyzed as individuals, increased methylation
   level was associated with decreased IMT at four of the seven studied CpG
   sites. However, this association substantially reduced in the matched
   pair analyses. Further adjustment for MAOA genotype also considerably
   attenuated this association.
   Conclusions: The association between MAOA promoter methylation and
   carotid IMT is largely explained by familial factors shared by the
   twins. Because twins reared together share early life experience, which
   may leave a long-lasting epigenetic mark, aberrant MAOA methylation may
   represent an early biomarker for unhealthy familial environment.
   Clarification of familial factors associated with DNA methylation and
   early atherosclerosis will provide important information to uncover
   clinical correlates of disease.

TI Thyroid-like cholangiocarcinoma of the liver: an unusual morphologic
   variant with follicular, trabecular and insular patterns
SO ANNALS OF HEPATOLOGY
AB We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with a 19 cm malignant hepatic
   neoplasm with morphological features that closely resembled a follicular
   thyroid carcinoma. Despite this, it was interpreted as a
   cholangiocarcinoma due to the absence of a primary thyroid tumor and the
   lack of thyroglobulin and TTF-1 immunoreactivity by the hepatic tumor.
   The left hepatic lobectomy specimen showed an encapsulated and
   multinodular gray-white mass with cystic and hemorrhagic areas.
   Microscopically, it displayed predominant macro and microfolicullar
   patterns with focal solid, trabecular and insular areas. The small and
   distended follicles contained a colloid-like secretion and were lined by
   low cuboidal cells with scant cytoplasm, round or oval hyperchromatic
   nuclei with fine chromatin. The solid areas, trabecular and insular
   structures were similar to those of follicular or papillary thyroid
   carcinomas. In addition, some of the neoplastic cells had clear nuclei
   with occasional grooves. The tumor was positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7,
   CK 19 and CD138, and negative for TTF-1, thyroglobulin, Hepar-1,
   Glypican-3, alpha-fetoprotein and neuroendocrine markers. A thyroid
   neoplasm was excluded clinically and by ultrasound and computed
   tomography. Although, the residual hepatic parenchyma was initially not
   cirrhotic, the patient eventually developed cryptogenic cirrhosis. The
   patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and died of metastatic disease 18
   months after surgery. The thyroid-like pattern broadens the morphologic
   spectrum of cholangiocarcinoma.

TI Five Friends of Methylated Chromatin Target of
   Protein-Arginine-Methyltransferase[Prmt]-1 (Chtop), a Complex Linking
   Arginine Methylation to Desumoylation
SO MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS
AB Chromatin target of Prmt1 (Chtop) is a vertebrate-specific
   chromatin-bound protein that plays an important role in transcriptional
   regulation. As its mechanism of action remains unclear, we identified
   Chtop-interacting proteins using a biotinylation-proteomics approach.
   Here we describe the identification and initial characterization of Five
   Friends of Methylated Chtop (5FMC). 5FMC is a nuclear complex that can
   only be recruited by Chtop when the latter is arginine-methylated by
   Prmt1. It consists of the co-activator Pelp1, the Sumo-specific protease
   Senp3, Wdr18, Tex10, and Las1L. Pelp1 functions as the core of 5FMC, as
   the other components become unstable in the absence of Pelp1. We show
   that recruitment of 5FMC to Zbp-89, a zinc-finger transcription factor,
   affects its sumoylation status and transactivation potential.
   Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic link between arginine
   methylation and (de) sumoylation in the control of transcriptional
   activity. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 11: 10.1074/mcp.M112.017194,

TI HP1a Recruitment to Promoters Is Independent of H3K9 Methylation in
   Drosophila melanogaster
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)proteins, recognized readers of the
   heterochromatin mark methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), are
   important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and
   chromosome structure. In Drosophila melanogaster three histone lysine
   methyl transferases (HKMTs)are associated with the methylation of H3K9:
   Su(var)3-9, Setdb1, and G9a. To probe the dependence of HP1a binding on
   H3K9me, its dependence on these three HKMTs, and the division of labor
   between the HKMTs, we have examined correlations between HP1a binding
   and H3K9me patterns in wild type and null mutants of these HKMTs. We
   show here that Su(var)3-9 controls H3K9me-dependent binding of HP1a in
   pericentromeric regions, while Setdb1 controls it in cytological region
   2L:31 and (together with POF)in chromosome 4. HP1a binds to the
   promoters and within bodies of active genes in these three regions. More
   importantly, however, HP1a binding at promoters of active genes is
   independent of H3K9me and POF. Rather, it is associated with
   heterochromatin protein 2 (HP2)and open chromatin. Our results support a
   hypothesis in which HP1a nucleates with high affinity independently of
   H3K9me in promoters of active genes and then spreads via H3K9
   methylation and transient looping contacts with those H3K9me target
   sites.

   study, the methylation status of the UNC5C gene was examined in primary
   carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues derived from 42 patients
   with HCC. Results: Methylation of the UNC5C gene was detected in 11 out

   was frequently detected in colorectal cancers. However, the relationship
   between the WNT5A methylation and the characteristics of gastric cancer
   remains unknown. Methodology: Methylation status of the WNT5A gene was
   examined in primary carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues
   derived from 38 patients with gastric cancer using quantitative
   methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and the correlation between the
   methylation status and the clinicopathological findings was evaluated.
   Results: Aberrant methylation of the WNT5A gene was detected in 7 out of
   the 38 (18%) primary gastric carcinomas, suggesting that the methylation
   of WNT5A is observed in gastric carcinomas as well as colorectal ones.
   The clinicopathological data were correlated with the methylation
   results. A significant difference was observed in the extent of tumor
   (p=0.0226). Moreover, a trend was shown towards early TNM stages in
   methylated tumors (p=0.209). Conclusions: WNT5A was more frequently
   methylated in early gastric carcinomas.

TI Histone demethylase JMJD2B-mediated cell proliferation regulated by
   hypoxia and radiation in gastric cancer cell
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Histone modifying factors are functional components of chromatin and
   play a role in gene regulation. The expression level of JMJD2B, a
   histone demethylase, is notably up-regulated in cancer tissues.
   Upregulation of JMJD2B promotes cancer cell proliferation under hypoxic
   conditions through target gene expression. Here, we describe the
   patterns of histone methylation and JMJD2B expression under various
   stressed conditions, such as hypoxia and radiation, in a gastric cancer
   cell line. JMJD2B expression in AGS cells was actively regulated by
   hypoxia and radiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
   demonstrated that binding of JMJD2B on the cyclin A1 (CCNA1) promoter
   resulted in CCNA1 upregulation under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we
   confirmed that AGS cell proliferation was directly affected by JMJD2B
   and CCNA1 expression by performing experiments with JMJD2B depleted
   cells. Interestingly, the effects of JMJD2B on cell growth under hypoxia
   were remarkably repressed after gamma-ray irradiation. These results
   suggest that JMJD2B may play a central role in gastric cancer cell
   growth and might constitute a novel therapeutic target to overcome
   hypoxia-induced radio-resistance, thereby improving the efficiency of
   radiation therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI SATB1-mediated functional packaging of chromatin into loops
SO METHODS
AB Mammalian genomes are organized into multiple layers of higher-order
   chromatin structure, and in this organization chromatin looping is a
   striking and crucial feature that brings together distal genomic loci
   into close spatial proximity. Such three-dimensional organization of
   chromatin has been suggested to be functionally important in gene
   regulation. Many important questions need to be addressed, such as what
   types of nuclear proteins are responsible for folding chromatin into
   loops, whether there are any genomic marks that serve as the core sites
   of chromatin folding events, how distal genomic sites are brought
   together, and what are the biological consequences for interactions
   between distal genomic loci. In order to address these fundamental
   questions, it is essential to devise and employ methods that can capture
   higher-order structures formed by specific nuclear proteins at high
   resolution. In this article, in order to describe methods of analyzing
   protein-mediated chromatin interactions, we will use as an example a
   global genome-organizer protein, SATB1, which mediates chromatin
   looping. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Long distance relationships: Enhancer-promoter communication and dynamic
   gene transcription
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB The three-dimensional regulation of gene transcription involves loop
   formation between enhancer and promoter elements, controlling
   spatiotemporal gene expression in multicellular organisms. Enhancers are
   usually located in non-coding DNA and can activate gene transcription by
   recruiting transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors and RNA
   Polymerase II. Research over the last few years has revealed that
   enhancers have tell-tale characteristics that facilitate their detection
   by several approaches, although the hallmarks of enhancers are not
   always uniform. Enhancers likely play an important role in the
   activation of genes by functioning as a primary point of contact for
   transcriptional activators, and by making physical contact with gene
   promoters often by means of a chromatin loop. Although numerous
   transcriptional regulators participate in the formation of chromatin
   loops that bring enhancers into proximity with promoters, the
   mechanism(s) of enhancer-promoter connectivity remain enigmatic. Here we
   discuss enhancer function, review some of the many proteins shown to be
   involved in establishing enhancer-promoter loops, and describe the
   dynamics of enhancer-promoter contacts during development,
   differentiation and in specific cell types. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

TI Tissue-Specific Regulation of Chromatin Insulator Function
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Chromatin insulators organize the genome into distinct transcriptional
   domains and contribute to cell type-specific chromatin organization.
   However, factors regulating tissue-specific insulator function have not
   yet been discovered. Here we identify the RNA recognition
   motif-containing protein Shep as a direct interactor of two individual
   components of the gypsy insulator complex in Drosophila. Mutation of
   shep improves gypsy-dependent enhancer blocking, indicating a role as a
   negative regulator of insulator activity. Unlike ubiquitously expressed
   core gypsy insulator proteins, Shep is highly expressed in the central
   nervous system (CNS) with lower expression in other tissues. We
   developed a novel, quantitative tissue-specific barrier assay to
   demonstrate that Shep functions as a negative regulator of insulator
   activity in the CNS but not in muscle tissue. Additionally, mutation of
   shep alters insulator complex nuclear localization in the CNS but has no
   effect in other tissues. Consistent with negative regulatory activity,
   ChIP-seq analysis of Shep in a CNS-derived cell line indicates
   substantial genome-wide colocalization with a single gypsy insulator
   component but limited overlap with intact insulator complexes. Taken
   together, these data reveal a novel, tissue-specific mode of regulation
   of a chromatin insulator.

TI The Yeast SR-Like Protein Npl3 Links Chromatin Modification to mRNA
   Processing
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Eukaryotic gene expression involves tight coordination between
   transcription and pre-mRNA splicing; however, factors responsible for
   this coordination remain incompletely defined. Here, we explored the
   genetic, functional, and biochemical interactions of a likely
   coordinator, Npl3, an SR-like protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that
   we recently showed is required for efficient co-transcriptional
   recruitment of the splicing machinery. We surveyed the NPL3 genetic
   interaction space and observed a significant enrichment for genes
   involved in histone modification and chromatin remodeling. Specifically,
   we found that Npl3 genetically interacts with both Bre1, which
   mono-ubiquitinates histone H2B as part of the RAD6 Complex, and Ubp8,
   the de-ubiquitinase of the SAGA Complex. In support of these genetic
   data, we show that Bre1 physically interacts with Npl3 in an
   RNA-independent manner. Furthermore, using a genome-wide splicing
   microarray, we found that the known splicing defect of a strain lacking
   Npl3 is exacerbated by deletion of BRE1 or UBP8, a phenomenon
   phenocopied by a point mutation in H2B that abrogates ubiquitination.
   Intriguingly, even in the presence of wild-type NPL3, deletion of BRE1
   exhibits a mild splicing defect and elicits a growth defect in
   combination with deletions of early and late splicing factors. Taken
   together, our data reveal a connection between Npl3 and an extensive
   array of chromatin factors and describe an unanticipated functional link
   between histone H2B ubiquitination and pre-mRNA splicing.

TI Adaptive Evolution and the Birth of CTCF Binding Sites in the Drosophila
   Genome
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Changes in the physical interaction between cis-regulatory DNA sequences
   and proteins drive the evolution of gene expression. However, it has
   proven difficult to accurately quantify evolutionary rates of such
   binding change or to estimate the relative effects of selection and
   drift in shaping the binding evolution. Here we examine the genome-wide
   binding of CTCF in four species of Drosophila separated by between
   similar to 2.5 and 25 million years. CTCF is a highly conserved protein
   known to be associated with insulator sequences in the genomes of human
   and Drosophila. Although the binding preference for CTCF is highly
   conserved, we find that CTCF binding itself is highly evolutionarily
   dynamic and has adaptively evolved. Between species, binding divergence
   increased linearly with evolutionary distance, and CTCF binding profiles
   are diverging rapidly at the rate of 2.22% per million years (Myr). At
   least 89 new CTCF binding sites have originated in the Drosophila
   melanogaster genome since the most recent common ancestor with
   Drosophila simulans. Comparing these data to genome sequence data from
   37 different strains of Drosophila melanogaster, we detected signatures
   of selection in both newly gained and evolutionarily conserved binding
   sites. Newly evolved CTCF binding sites show a significantly stronger
   signature for positive selection than older sites. Comparative gene
   expression profiling revealed that expression divergence of genes
   adjacent to CTCF binding site is significantly associated with the gain
   and loss of CTCF binding. Further, the birth of new genes is associated
   with the birth of new CTCF binding sites. Our data indicate that binding
   of Drosophila CTCF protein has evolved under natural selection, and CTCF
   binding evolution has shaped both the evolution of gene expression and
   genome evolution during the birth of new genes.

TI Human-Specific Histone Methylation Signatures at Transcription Start
   Sites in Prefrontal Neurons
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Cognitive abilities and disorders unique to humans are thought to result
   from adaptively driven changes in brain transcriptomes, but little is
   known about the role of cis-regulatory changes affecting transcription
   start sites (TSS). Here, we mapped in human, chimpanzee, and macaque
   prefrontal cortex the genome-wide distribution of histone H3
   trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an epigenetic mark sharply
   regulated at TSS, and identified 471 sequences with human-specific
   enrichment or depletion. Among these were 33 loci selectively methylated
   in neuronal but not non-neuronal chromatin from children and adults,
   including TSS at DPP10 (2q14.1), CNTN4 and CHL1 (3p26.3), and other
   neuropsychiatric susceptibility genes. Regulatory sequences at DPP10 and
   additional loci carried a strong footprint of hominid adaptation,
   including elevated nucleotide substitution rates and regulatory motifs
   absent in other primates (including archaic hominins), with evidence for
   selective pressures during more recent evolution and adaptive fixations
   in modern populations. Chromosome conformation capture at two
   neurodevelopmental disease loci, 2q14.1 and 16p11.2, revealed higher
   order chromatin structures resulting in physical contact of multiple
   human-specific H3K4me3 peaks spaced 0.5-1 Mb apart, in conjunction with
   a novel cis-bound antisense RNA linked to Polycomb repressor proteins
   and downregulated DPP10 expression. Therefore, coordinated epigenetic
   regulation via newly derived TSS chromatin could play an important role
   in the emergence of human-specific gene expression networks in brain
   that contribute to cognitive functions and neurological disease
   susceptibility in modern day humans.

TI Impact of a selfish B chromosome on chromatin dynamics and nuclear
   organization in Nasonia
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB B chromosomes are centric chromosomal fragments present in thousands of
   eukaryotic genomes. Because most B chromosomes are non-essential, they
   can be lost without consequence. In order to persist, however, some B
   chromosomes can impose strong forms of intra-genomic conflict. An
   extreme case is the paternal sex ratio (PSR) B chromosome in the jewel
   wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Transmitted solely via the sperm, PSR
   'imprints' the paternal chromatin so that it is destroyed during the
   first mitosis of the embryo. Owing to the haplo-diploid reproduction of
   N. vitripennis, PSR-induced loss of the paternal chromatin converts
   embryos that should become females into PSR-transmitting males. This
   conversion is key to the persistence of PSR, although the underlying
   mechanisms are largely unexplored. We assessed how PSR affects the
   paternal chromatin and then investigated how PSR is transmitted
   efficiently at the cellular level. We found that PSR does not affect
   progression of the paternal chromatin through the cell cycle but,
   instead, alters its normal Histone H3 phosphorylation and loading of the
   Condensin complex. PSR localizes to the outer periphery of the paternal
   nucleus, a position that we propose is crucial for it to escape from the
   defective paternal set. In sperm, PSR consistently localizes to the
   extreme anterior tip of the elongated nucleus, while the normal wasp
   chromosomes localize broadly across the nucleus. Thus, PSR may alter or
   bypass normal nuclear organizational processes to achieve its position.
   These findings provide new insights into how selfish genetic elements
   can impact chromatin-based processes for their survival.

TI Analysis of the epigenetic status of telomeres by using ChIP-seq data
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The chromatin structure of eukaryotic telomeres plays an essential role
   in telomere functions. However, their study might be impaired by the
   presence of interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs), which have a
   widespread distribution in different model systems. We have developed a
   simple approach to study the chromatin structure of Arabidopsis
   telomeres independently of ITSs by analyzing ChIP-seq data. This
   approach could be used to study the chromatin structure of telomeres in
   some other eukaryotes. The analysis of ChIP-seq experiments revealed
   that Arabidopsis telomeres have higher density of histone H3 than
   centromeres, which might reflects their short nucleosomal organization.
   These experiments also revealed that Arabidopsis telomeres have lower
   levels of heterochromatic marks than centromeres (H3K9(Me2) and
   H3K27(Me)), higher levels of some euchromatic marks (H3K4(Me2) and
   H3K9Ac) and similar or lower levels of other euchromatic marks
   (H3K4(Me3), H3K36(Me2), H3K36(Me3) and H3K18Ac). Interestingly, the
   ChIP-seq experiments also revealed that Arabidopsis telomeres exhibit
   high levels of H3K27(Me3), a repressive mark that associates with many
   euchromatic genes. The epigenetic profile of Arabidopsis telomeres is
   closely related to the previously defined chromatin state 2. This
   chromatin state is found in 23% of Arabidopsis genes, many of which are
   repressed or lowly expressed. At least, in part, this scenario is
   similar in rice.

TI Chromatin signature discovery via histone modification profile
   alignments
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB We report on the development of an unsupervised algorithm for the
   genome-wide discovery and analysis of chromatin signatures. Our
   Chromatin-profile Alignment followed by Tree-clustering algorithm (ChAT)
   employs dynamic programming of combinatorial histone modification
   profiles to identify locally similar chromatin sub-regions and provides
   complementary utility with respect to existing methods. We applied ChAT
   to genomic maps of 39 histone modifications in human CD4(+) T cells to
   identify both known and novel chromatin signatures. ChAT was able to
   detect chromatin signatures previously associated with transcription
   start sites and enhancers as well as novel signatures associated with a
   variety of regulatory elements. Promoter-associated signatures
   discovered with ChAT indicate that complex chromatin signatures, made up
   of numerous co-located histone modifications, facilitate cell-type
   specific gene expression. The discovery of novel L1
   retrotransposon-associated bivalent chromatin signatures suggests that
   these elements influence the mono-allelic expression of human genes by
   shaping the chromatin environment of imprinted genomic regions. Analysis
   of long gene-associated chromatin signatures point to a role for the
   H4K20me1 and H3K79me3 histone modifications in transcriptional pause
   release. The novel chromatin signatures and functional associations
   uncovered by ChAT underscore the ability of the algorithm to yield novel
   insight on chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms.

TI Detection and differential diagnosis of colon cancer by a cumulative

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Alterations in the methylation of promoters of cancer-related genes are
   promising biomarkers for the early detection of disease. Compared with
   single methylation alteration, assessing combined methylation
   alterations can provide higher association with specific cancer. Here we
   use cationic conjugated polymer-based fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer to quantitatively analyse DNA methylation levels of seven colon
   cancer-related genes in a Chinese population. Through a stepwise
   discriminant analysis and cumulative detection of methylation
   alterations, we acquire high accuracy and sensitivity for colon cancer
   detection (86.3 and 86.7%) and for differential diagnosis (97.5 and
   94%). Moreover, we identify a correlation between the CpG island
   methylator phenotype and clinically important parameters in patients
   with colon cancer. The cumulative analysis of promoter methylation
   alterations by the cationic conjugated polymer-based fluorescence
   resonance energy transfer may be useful for the screening and
   differential diagnosis of patients with colon cancer, and for performing
   clinical correlation analyses.

TI Gene organization inside replication domains in mammalian genomes
SO COMPTES RENDUS MECANIQUE
AB We investigate the large-scale organization of human genes with respect
   to "master" replication origins that were previously identified as
   bordering nucleotide compositional skew domains. We separate genes in
   two categories depending on their CpG enrichment at the promoter which
   can be considered as a marker of germline DNA methylation. Using
   expression data in mouse, we confirm that CpG-rich genes are highly
   expressed in germline whereas CpG-poor genes are in a silent state. We
   further show that, whether tissue-specific or broadly expressed
   (housekeeping genes), the CpG-rich genes are over-represented close to
   the replication skew domain borders suggesting some coordination of
   replication and transcription. We also reveal that the transcription of
   the longest CpG-rich genes is co-oriented with replication fork
   progression so that the promoter of these transcriptionally active genes
   be located into the accessible open chromatin environment surrounding
   the master replication origins that border the replication skew domains.
   The observation of a similar gene organization in the mouse genome
   confirms the interplay of replication, transcription and chromatin
   structure as the cornerstone of mammalian genome architecture. (C) 2012

TI Genome-wide study of DNA methylation alterations in response to diazinon

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Pesticide exposure has repeatedly been associated with cancers. However,
   molecular mechanisms are largely undetermined. In this study, we
   examined whether exposure to diazinon, a common organophosphate that has
   been associated with cancers, could induce DNA methylation alterations.
   We conducted genome-wide DNA methylation analyses on DNA samples
   obtained from human hematopoietic K562 cell exposed to diazinon and
   ethanol using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip.
   Bayesian-adjusted t-tests were used to identify differentially
   methylated gene promoter CpG sites. We identified 1069 CpG sites in 984
   genes with significant methylation changes in diazinon-treated cells.
   Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that some genes are tumor suppressor
   genes, such as TP53INP1 (3.0-fold, q-value <0.001) and PTEN (2.6-fold,
   q-value <0.001), some genes are in cancer-related pathways, such as
   HDAC3 (2.2-fold, q-value = 0.002), and some remain functionally unknown.
   Our results provided direct experimental evidence that diazinon may
   modify gene promoter DNA methylation levels, which may play a
   pathological role in cancer development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

TI O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) Promoter methylation is a

SO RADIATION ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Gene silencing of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
   (MGMT) by promoter methylation improves the outcome of glioblastoma
   patients after combined therapy of alkylating chemotherapeutic agents
   and radiation. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of
   MGMT promoter methylation in soft tissue sarcoma to identify patients
   eligible for alkylating agent chemotherapy such as temozolomide.
   Findings: Paraffin tumor blocks of 75 patients with representative STS
   subtypes were evaluated. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter was
   assessed by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction analysis
   (PCR). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was applied to verify
   expression of MGMT. MGMT gene silencing was assumed if MGMT promoter
   methylation was present and the fraction of tumor cells expressing MGMT
   was 20% or less. Methylation specific PCR detected methylated MGMT
   promoter in 10/75 cases. Immunohistochemical staining of nuclear MGMT
   was negative in 15/75 cases. 6/75 tumor samples showed MGMT promoter
   methylation and negative immunohistochemical nuclear staining of MGMT.
   In none of the tested STS subtypes we found a fraction of tumors with
   MGMT silencing exceeding 22%.
   Conclusion: MGMT gene silencing is a rare event in soft tissue sarcoma
   and cannot be recommended as a selection criterion for the therapy of
   STS patients with alkylating agents such as temozolomide.

TI Epigenetic silencing of the 3p22 tumor suppressor DLEC1 by promoter CpG
   methylation in non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Inactivaion of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) by promoter CpG
   methylation frequently occurs in tumorigenesis, even in the early
   stages, contributing to the initiation and progression of human cancers.
   Deleted in lung and esophageal cancer 1 (DLEC1), located at the
   3p22-21.3 TSG cluster, has been identified frequently silenced by
   promoter CpG methylation in multiple carcinomas, however, no study has
   been performed for lymphomas yet.
   Methods: We examined the expression of DLEC1 by semi-quantitative
   reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and evaluated the promoter methylation
   of DLEC1 by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic
   sequencing (BGS) in common lymphoma cell lines and tumors.
   Results: Here we report that DLEC1 is readily expressed in normal
   lymphoid tissues including lymph nodes and PBMCs, but reduced or
   silenced in 70% (16/23) of non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines,
   including 2/6 diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL), 1/2 peripheral T cell
   lymphomas, 5/5 Burkitt, 6/7 Hodgkin and 2/3 nasal killer (NK)/T-cell
   lymphoma cell lines. Promoter CpG methylation was frequently detected in
   80% (20/25) of lymphoma cell lines and correlated with DLEC1
   downregulation/silencing. Pharmacologic demethylation reversed DLEC1
   expression in lymphoma cell lines along with concomitant promoter
   demethylation. DLEC1 methylation was also frequently detected in 32 out
   of 58 (55%) different types of lymphoma tissues, but not in normal lymph
   nodes. Furthermore, DLEC1 was specifically methylated in the sera of
   3/13 (23%) Hodgkin lymphoma patients.
   Conclusions: Thus, methylation-mediated silencing of DLEC1 plays an
   important role in multiple lymphomagenesis, and may serve as a
   non-invasive tumor marker for lymphoma diagnosis.

TI Histone acetylation mediates epigenetic regulation of transcriptional
   reprogramming in insects during metamorphosis, wounding and infection
SO FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY
AB Background: Gene expression in eukaryotes is regulated by histone
   acetylation/deacetylation, an epigenetic process mediated by histone
   acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) whose
   opposing activities are tightly regulated. The acetylation of histones
   by HATs increases DNA accessibility and promotes gene expression,
   whereas the removal of acetyl groups by HDACs has the opposite effect.
   Results: We explored the role of HDACs and HATs in epigenetic
   reprogramming during metamorphosis, wounding and infection in the
   lepidopteran model host Galleria mellonella. We measured the expression
   of genes encoding components of HATs and HDACs to monitor the
   transcriptional activity of each enzyme complex and found that both
   enzymes were upregulated during pupation. Specific HAT inhibitors were
   able to postpone pupation and to reduce insect survival following
   wounding, whereas HDAC inhibitors accelerated pupation and increased
   survival. The administration of HDAC inhibitors modulated the expression
   of effector genes with key roles in tissue remodeling (matrix
   metalloproteinase), the regulation of sepsis (inhibitor of
   metalloproteinases from insects) and host defense (antimicrobial
   peptides), and simultaneously induced HAT activity, suggesting that
   histone acetylation is regulated by a feedback mechanism. We also
   discovered that both the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae
   and the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes can delay
   metamorphosis in G. mellonella by skewing the HDAC/HAT balance.
   Conclusions: Our study provides for the first evidence that pathogenic
   bacteria can interfere with the regulation of HDACs and HATs in insects
   which appear to manipulate host immunity and development. We conclude
   that histone acetylation/deacetylation in insects mediates
   transcriptional reprogramming during metamorphosis and in response to
   wounding and infection.

TI Epigenetic regulation of stem cells differentiating along the neural
   lineage
SO CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Many lineage-specific genes are poised and silenced in stem cells. Upon
   differentiation, genes that are related to self-renewal and alternative
   lineages are stably silenced. CpG methylation at proximal promoters and
   PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 play a role in silencing genes temporarily or
   permanently, with or without coexistence of active epigenetic marks,
   respectively. Interestingly, DNA methylation on neuronal genes that is
   distal to transcription start site enable transcription activation owing
   to its ability to repel PRC2-mediated inhibition. In addition, DNA
   demethylase Tet proteins play a role in regulation of changes in DNA
   methylation and related H3K27me3 during differentiation. Collectively, a
   complex epigenetic network formed by H3K4me3, histone
   acetylation/deacetylation, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation/demethylation
   act together to regulate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

TI Chromosome-wide regulation of euchromatin-specific 5mC to 5hmC
   conversion in mouse ES cells and female human somatic cells
SO CHROMOSOME RESEARCH
AB DNA cytosine methylation (5mC) is indispensable for a number of cellular
   processes, including retrotransposon silencing, genomic imprinting, and
   X chromosome inactivation in mammalian development. Recent studies have
   focused on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a new epigenetic mark or
   intermediate in the DNA demethylation pathway. However, 5hmC itself has
   no role in pluripotency maintenance in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
   lacking Dnmt1, 3a, and 3b. Here, we demonstrated that 5hmC accumulated
   on euchromatic chromosomal bands that were marked with di- and
   tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3) in mouse ESCs. By
   contrast, heterochromatin enriched with H3K9me3, including mouse
   chromosomal G-bands, pericentric repeats, human satellite 2 and 3, and
   inactive X chromosomes, was not enriched with 5hmC. Therefore, enzymes
   that hydroxylate the methyl group of 5mC belonging to the Tet family
   might be excluded from inactive chromatin, which may restrict 5mC to
   5hmC conversion in euchromatin to prevent nonselective de novo DNA
   methylation.

TI Apicidin and Docetaxel Combination Treatment Drives CTCFL Expression and
   HMGB1 Release Acting as Potential Antitumor Immune Response Inducers in
   Metastatic Breast Cancer Cells
SO NEOPLASIA
AB Currently approved combination regimens available for the treatment of
   metastatic tumors, such as breast cancer, have been shown to increase
   response rates, often at the cost of a substantial increase in toxicity.
   An ideal combination strategy may consist of agents with different
   mechanisms of action leading to complementary antitumor activities and
   safety profiles. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   the epigenetic modulator apicidin in combination with the cytotoxic
   agent docetaxel in tumor breast cell lines characterized by different
   grades of invasiveness. We report that combined treatment of apicidin
   and docetaxel, at low toxicity doses, stimulates in metastatic breast
   cancer cells the expression of CTCF-like protein and other cancer
   antigens, thus potentially favoring an antitumor immune response. In
   addition, apicidin and docetaxel co-treatment specifically stimulates
   apoptosis, characterized by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-8
   activation. Importantly, following combined exposure to these agents,
   metastatic cells were also found to induce signals of immunogenic
   apoptosis such as cell surface expression of calreticulin and release of
   considerable amounts of high-mobility group box 1 protein, thus
   potentially promoting the translation of induced cell death into
   antitumor immune response. Altogether, our results indicate that the
   combined use of apicidin and docetaxel, at a low toxicity profile, may
   represent a potential innovative strategy able to activate complementary
   antitumor pathways in metastatic breast cancer cells, associated with a
   potential control of metastatic growth and possible induction of
   antitumor immunity. Neoplasia (2012) 14, 855-867

TI Effects of sub-chronic exposure to cadmium on some parameters of calcium
   and iodine metabolisms in the Shaw's jird Meriones shawi
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB In the present work we determined effects of a sub-chronic exposure to
   cadmium on some parameters of calcium and iodine metabolisms in Meriones
   shawi, a desert rodent species occupying the arid steppes of Tunisia and
   other countries. Fourteen jirds of both sex were equally divided into a
   control group receiving diet without cadmium and a treated group
   receiving cadmium in the diet during 30, 45, 60 and 90 days. At the end
   of each period, 5 jirds from each group were sacrificed. In
   cadmium-treated group, cadmium accumulation and total metallothioneins
   synthesis in the liver and kidneys were high and dependant on the
   duration of treatment. Cadmium caused significant modifications in the
   body weight and in the relative weights of the liver, femur and
   thyroids, in parallel to a decrease in calcium content in serum and in
   femur. Cadmium also decreased iodine content in serum and in the
   thyroids. Several impairments were dependant on the duration of exposure
   and were more pronounced at the end of the experiment. In conclusion, a
   sub-chronic exposure to cadmium induces perturbations in calcium and
   iodine metabolisms in Meriones shawi. However, effects on calcium seem
   to be more evident. We can conclude also that Meriones shawi is an
   indicator of cadmium presence in arid environments. (c) 2012 Elsevier

TI Methylation of tumor suppressor microRNAs: lessons from lymphoid
   malignancies
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
AB miRNAs are a group of small noncoding RNAs measuring 19-25 nucleotides.
   Sequence-specific binding of miRNAs to the 3' untranslated regions of
   target genes leads to translational repressions. Dysregulation of miRNA
   expression involved in cancer can be triggered by multiple mechanisms
   including aberrant DNA methylation of the miRNA gene promoter. Of note,
   DNA methylation of tumor suppressor miRNAs has been implicated in
   various human cancers. Moreover, miRNA silencing mediated by aberrant
   promoter DNA methylation can potentially be reversed by hypomethylating
   agents, and hence may pose a new therapeutic target in cancer. In this
   review, the authors will focus on the aberrant methylation of miRNAs in
   the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies including chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia, multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

TI Hypoxia-induced DNA hypermethylation in human pulmonary fibroblasts is
   associated with Thy-1 promoter methylation and the development of a
   pro-fibrotic phenotype
SO RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
AB Background: Pulmonary fibrosis is a debilitating and lethal disease with
   no effective treatment options. Understanding the pathological processes
   at play will direct the application of novel therapeutic avenues.
   Hypoxia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis
   yet the precise mechanism by which it contributes to disease progression
   remains to be fully elucidated. It has been shown that chronic hypoxia
   can alter DNA methylation patterns in tumour-derived cell lines. This
   epigenetic alteration can induce changes in cellular phenotype with
   promoter methylation being associated with gene silencing. Of particular
   relevance to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the observation that
   Thy-1 promoter methylation is associated with a myofibroblast phenotype
   where loss of Thy-1 occurs alongside increased alpha smooth muscle actin
   (alpha-SMA) expression. The initial aim of this study was to determine
   whether hypoxia regulates DNA methylation in normal human lung
   fibroblasts (CCD19Lu). As it has been reported that hypoxia suppresses
   Thy-1 expression during lung development we also studied the effect of
   hypoxia on Thy-1 promoter methylation and gene expression.
   Methods: CCD19Lu were grown for up to 8 days in hypoxia and assessed for
   global changes in DNA methylation using flow cytometry. Real-time PCR
   was used to quantify expression of Thy-1, alpha-SMA, collagen I and III.
   Genomic DNA was bisulphite treated and methylation specific PCR (MSPCR)
   was used to examine the methylation status of the Thy-1 promoter.
   Results: Significant global hypermethylation was detected in hypoxic
   fibroblasts relative to normoxic controls and was accompanied by
   increased expression of myofibroblast markers. Thy-1 mRNA expression was
   suppressed in hypoxic cells, which was restored with the demethylating
   agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. MSPCR revealed that Thy-1 became
   methylated following fibroblast exposure to 1% O(2).
   Conclusion: These data suggest that global and gene-specific changes in
   DNA methylation may play an important role in fibroblast function in
   hypoxia.

TI Methylation matters? Decreased methylation status of genomic DNA in the
   blood of schizophrenic twins
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB Studies of schizophrenia inheritance in identical twins show a
   concordance of about 50%, which supports an epigenetic model. In our
   present study we investigated methylation of genomic DNA and promoter
   methylation of Reelin and SOX10 genes in peripheral blood of twins
   suffering from schizophrenia. Global DNA methylation was reduced (52.3%)
   in schizophrenic twins if compared with healthy control twins (65.7%).
   The reduced methylation was significant in males only. We also found a
   similar hypomethylation in the non-affected twins of discordant pairs
   and a mixed group of psychiatric controls. In discordant twins there was
   a relative hypermethylation of the SOX10 promoter.
   Within-pair-difference of methylation of Reelin promoter was
   significantly lower in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. (C)

TI Hepatitis B virus X protein suppresses caveolin-1 expression in
   hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating DNA methylation
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: To understand the molecular mechanisms of caveolin-1
   downregulation by hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx).
   Methods: The DNA methylation status of the caveolin-1 promoter was
   examined by nested methylation-specific PCR of 33 hepatitis B virus
   (HBV)-infected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. The SMMC-7721
   hepatoma cell line was transfected with a recombinant HBx adenoviral
   vector, and the effects of HBx protein on caveolin-1 expression and
   promoter methylation were examined and confirmed by sequencing. A
   reporter gene containing the caveolin-1 promoter region was constructed,
   and the effects of HBx on the transcriptional activity of the promoter
   were also studied.
   Results: Methylation of the caveolin-1 promoter was detected in 84.8%
   (28/33) of HBV-infected HCC samples. Expression of caveolin-1 was
   significantly downregulated (P = 0.022), and multiple CpG sites in the
   promoter region of caveolin-1 were methylated in SMMC-7721 cells after
   HBx transfection. Transfected HBx significantly suppressed caveolin-1
   promoter activity (P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: HBx protein induces methylation of the caveolin-1 promoter
   region and suppresses its expression.

TI Promoter Methylation status of HIN-1 associated with outcomes of ovarian
   clear cell adenocarcinoma
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB Background: This study is to analyze promoter methylation of various
   tumor suppressor genes in different types of ovarian carcinoma and to
   identify potential therapeutic targets of ovarian clear cell
   adenocarcinoma (OCCA).
   Materials and methods: The promoter methylation statuses of 40 genes in
   primary ovarian carcinomas including 47 clear- and 63 non-clear-cell
   type tissues, 6 OCCA cell lines, 29 benign ovarian endometriotic cysts,
   and 31 normal controls were analyzed by methylation-specific multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). The MS-MLPA results
   were correlated with clinicopathological features and outcomes of 47
   OCCA patients. Functions of the target genes were further explored by
   Western Blot Analysis, apoptosis assay, and caspase-3/7 activity
   analysis.
   Results: Frequencies of methylated RASSF1A, CDH13, CACNA1A, HIN-1, and
   sFRP5 genes in OCCA tissues were significantly higher than those in
   non-OCCA cancerous tissues and benign endometriotic cysts. The expected
   OS for patients with methylated promoters of HIN-1 was significantly
   worse than those for patients without methylated HIN-1 (30% vs. 62%, p =
   0.002). The HIN-1 gene was over-expressed in ES2 cells, a significant
   reduction in cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and increasing
   paclitaxel sensitivity by reducing phosphorylation of Akt were observed.
   Conclusions: Methylation of HIN-1 promoter is a novel epigenetic
   biomarker associated with poor outcomes in OCCA patients. Ectopic
   expression of the HIN-1 gene increased paclitaxel sensitivity which is
   partly through Akt pathway.

TI A role for neuropeptide Y in the gender-specific gastrointestinal,
   corticosterone and feeding responses to stress
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Exposure to an acute stress inhibits gastric emptying and stimulates
   colonic transit via central neuropeptide Y (NPY) pathways; however,
   peripheral involvement is uncertain. The anxiogenic phenotype of
   NPY(-/-) mice is gender-dependent, raising the possibility that
   stress-induced gastrointestinal (GI) responses are female-dominant
   through NPY. The aim of this study was to determine GI transit rates,
   corticosterone levels and food intake after acute restraint (AR) or
   novel environment (NE) stress in male and female NPY(-/-) and WT mice.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   Upper gastrointestinal transit (UGIT) (established 30 min after oral
   gavage) and corticosterone levels were determined under basal or
   restrained conditions (30 min) and after treatment i.p. with Y(1)
   antagonist BIBO3304 or Y(2) antagonist BIIE0246. Faecal pellet output
   (FPO) was established after AR and treatment i.p. with NPY in the NE, as
   were colonic bead expulsion rates.
   KEY RESULTS
   UGIT and FPO were similar in unrestrained male and female mice. NPY(-/-)
   females displayed significantly slower UGIT than NPY(-/-) males after
   AR, but both genders displayed significantly higher FPO and reduced food
   intake relative to WT counterparts. Peripheral NPY treatment increased
   bead expulsion time in WT mice. AR male NPY(-/-) mice had higher levels
   of corticosterone than male WT mice; whilst in AR WT mice, after
   peripheral Y(1) and Y(2) receptor antagonism in males, and Y(2)
   antagonism in females, corticosterone was significantly elevated.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   NPY possesses a role in the gender-dependent susceptibility to
   stress-induced GI responses. Furthermore, NPY inhibits GI motility
   through Y(2) receptors and corticosterone release via peripheral Y(1)
   and Y(2) receptors.

TI Quantitative Assessment of DNA Methylation for the Detection of Cervical
   and Endometrial Adenocarcinomas in Liquid-Based Cytology Specimens
SO ANALYTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE CYTOLOGY AND HISTOLOGY
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the aberrant promoter hypermethylation as a
   screening tool for cervical adenocarcinomas (CAs) and endometrial
   adenocarcinomas (EAs) in cervical scrapings.
   STUDY DESIGN: A quantitative multiplex methylation-specific polymerase
   chain reaction approach was used to examine promoter methylation of 5
   genes (APC, HIN-1, RAR-beta, RASSF1A and Twist) in biopsy-confirmed CA
   (n = 31) and EA (n = 27) residual, liquid-based cytology samples. The
   data of negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy and low-grade
   squamous intraepithelial lesions were used as controls.
   RESULTS: Methylation levels of APC, RAR-beta, RASSF1A and Twist were
   significantly higher in CA than in control cervical samples. For EA,
   only the methylation levels of RASSF1A differed significantly from those
   of control. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that
   APC, RAR-beta and RASSF1A had the ability to distinguish CA/EA, CA and
   EA from control samples. In CA/EA and CA samples, the best 3-gene
   combination was RASSF1A/RAR-beta/APC. This 3-gene panel had a
   sensitivity of 87.0% for CA/EA and of 80.6% for CA and a specificity of
   79.3% for both CA/EA and CA. In EA samples, RASSF1A showed the best
   performance in distinguishing EA from control. The estimated sensitivity
   of RASSF1A for detecting EA was 63.0%, and its specificity was 96.3%.
   CONCLUSION: This feasibility study demonstrates that quantitative
   detection of aberrant DNA methylation in cervical scrapings may be a
   promising new diagnostic tool for the detection of CA and EA. (Anal

TI Dynamic changes in DNA methylation of stress-associated genes (OXTR,
   BDNF) after acute psychosocial stress
SO TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Environmentally induced epigenetic alterations are related to mental
   health. We investigated quantitative DNA methylation status before and
   after an acute psychosocial stressor in two stress-related genes:
   oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
   The cross sectional study took place at the Division of Theoretical and
   Clinical Psychobiology, University of Trier, Germany and was conducted
   from February to August 2009. We included 83 participants aged 61-67
   years. Thereof, 76 participants completed the full study procedure
   consisting of blood sampling before (pre-stress), 10 min after
   (post-stress) and 90 min after (follow-up) the Trier social stress test.
   We assessed quantitative DNA methylation of whole-blood cells using
   Sequenom EpiTYPER. Methylation status differed between sampling times in
   one target sequence of OXTR (P < 0.001): methylation increased from pre-
   to post-stress (P = 0.009) and decreased from post-stress to follow-up
   (P < 0.001). This decrease was also found in a second target sequence of
   OXTR (P = 0.034), where it lost statistical significance when blood cell
   count was statistically controlled. We did not detect any
   time-associated differences in methylation status of the examined BDNF
   region. The results suggest a dynamic regulation of DNA methylation in
   OXTR-which may in part reflect changes in blood cell composition-but not
   BDNF after acute psychosocial stress. This may enhance the understanding
   of how psychosocial events alter DNA methylation and could provide new
   insights into the etiology of mental disorders. Translational Psychiatry

TI methylKit: a comprehensive R package for the analysis of genome-wide DNA
   methylation profiles
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB DNA methylation is a chemical modification of cytosine bases that is
   pivotal for gene regulation, cellular specification and cancer
   development. Here, we describe an R package, methylKit, that rapidly
   analyzes genome-wide cytosine epigenetic profiles from high-throughput
   methylation and hydroxymethylation sequencing experiments. methylKit
   includes functions for clustering, sample quality visualization,
   differential methylation analysis and annotation features, thus
   automating and simplifying many of the steps for discerning
   statistically significant bases or regions of DNA methylation. Finally,
   we demonstrate methylKit on breast cancer data, in which we find
   statistically significant regions of differential methylation and
   stratify tumor subtypes. methylKit is available at
   http://code.google.com/p/methylkit.

TI Developmental features of DNA methylation during activation of the
   embryonic zebrafish genome
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs at the mid-blastula
   transition (MBT) in zebrafish and is a period of extensive chromatin
   remodeling. Genome-scale gametic demethylation and remethylation occurs
   after fertilization, during blastula stages, but how ZGA relates to
   promoter DNA methylation states is unknown. Using methylated DNA
   immunoprecipitation coupled to high-density microarray hybridization, we
   characterize genome-wide promoter DNA methylation dynamics before,
   during and after ZGA onset, in relation to changes in post-translational
   histone modifications and gene expression.
   Results: We show methylation of thousands of promoters before ZGA and
   additional methylation after ZGA, finding more dynamic methylation -1 to
   0 kb upstream of the transcription start site than downstream. The MBT
   is marked by differential methylation of high and low CpG promoters, and
   we identify hypomethylated promoters that are mostly CG-rich and remain
   hypomethylated through the MBT. Hypomethylated regions constitute a
   platform for H3K4me3, whereas H3K9me3 preferentially associates with
   methylated regions. H3K27me3 associates with either methylation state
   depending on its coincidence with H3K4me3 or H3K9me3. Cohorts of genes
   differentially expressed through the MBT period display distinct
   promoter methylation patterns related to CG content rather than
   transcriptional fate. Lastly, although a significant proportion of genes
   methylated in sperm are unmethylated in embryos, over 90% of genes
   methylated in embryos are also methylated in sperm.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a pre-patterning of developmental gene
   expression potential by a combination of DNA hypomethylation and H3K4
   trimethylation on CG-rich promoters, and are consistent with a
   transmission of DNA methylation states from gametes to early embryos.

TI Genome-wide promoter methylation analysis in neuroblastoma identifies
   prognostic methylation biomarkers
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Accurate outcome prediction in neuroblastoma, which is
   necessary to enable the optimal choice of risk-related therapy, remains
   a challenge. To improve neuroblastoma patient stratification, this study
   aimed to identify prognostic tumor DNA methylation biomarkers.
   Results: To identify genes silenced by promoter methylation, we first
   applied two independent genome-wide methylation screening methodologies
   to eight neuroblastoma cell lines. Specifically, we used re-expression
   profiling upon 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment and massively
   parallel sequencing after capturing with a methyl-CpG-binding domain
   (MBD-seq). Putative methylation markers were selected from
   DAC-upregulated genes through a literature search and an upfront
   methylation-specific PCR on 20 primary neuroblastoma tumors, as well as
   through MBD-seq in combination with publicly available neuroblastoma
   tumor gene expression data. This yielded 43 candidate biomarkers that
   were subsequently tested by high-throughput methylation-specific PCR on
   an independent cohort of 89 primary neuroblastoma tumors that had been
   selected for risk classification and survival. Based on this analysis,
   methylation of KRT19, FAS, PRPH, CNR1, QPCT, HIST1H3C, ACSS3 and GRB10
   was found to be associated with at least one of the classical risk
   factors, namely age, stage or MYCN status. Importantly, HIST1H3C and
   GNAS methylation was associated with overall and/or event-free survival.
   Conclusions: This study combines two genome-wide methylation discovery
   methodologies and is the most extensive validation study in
   neuroblastoma performed thus far. We identified several novel prognostic
   DNA methylation markers and provide a basis for the development of a DNA
   methylation-based prognostic classifier in neuroblastoma.

TI Modeling gene expression using chromatin features in various cellular
   contexts
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Previous work has demonstrated that chromatin feature levels
   correlate with gene expression. The ENCODE project enables us to further
   explore this relationship using an unprecedented volume of data.
   Expression levels from more than 100,000 promoters were measured using a
   variety of high-throughput techniques applied to RNA extracted by
   different protocols from different cellular compartments of several
   human cell lines. ENCODE also generated the genome-wide mapping of
   eleven histone marks, one histone variant, and DNase I hypersensitivity
   sites in seven cell lines.
   Results: We built a novel quantitative model to study the relationship
   between chromatin features and expression levels. Our study not only
   confirms that the general relationships found in previous studies hold
   across various cell lines, but also makes new suggestions about the
   relationship between chromatin features and gene expression levels. We
   found that expression status and expression levels can be predicted by
   different groups of chromatin features, both with high accuracy. We also
   found that expression levels measured by CAGE are better predicted than
   by RNA-PET or RNA-Seq, and different categories of chromatin features
   are the most predictive of expression for different RNA measurement
   methods. Additionally, PolyA+ RNA is overall more predictable than
   PolyA- RNA among different cell compartments, and PolyA+ cytosolic RNA
   measured with RNA-Seq is more predictable than PolyA+ nuclear RNA, while
   the opposite is true for PolyA- RNA.
   Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into transcriptional
   regulation by analyzing chromatin features in different cellular
   contexts.

TI Natural variation of H3K27me3 distribution between two Arabidopsis
   accessions and its association with flanking transposable elements
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation and lysine 9
   di-methylation are independent repressive chromatin modifications in
   Arabidopsis thaliana. H3K27me3 is established and maintained by Polycomb
   repressive complexes whereas H3K9me2 is catalyzed by SUVH histone
   methyltransferases. Both modifications can spread to flanking regions
   after initialization and were shown to be mutually exclusive in
   Arabidopsis.
   Results: We analyzed the extent of natural variation of H3K27me3 in the
   two accessions Landsberg erecta (Ler) and Columbia (Col) and their F1
   hybrids. The majority of H3K27me3 target genes in Col were unchanged in
   Ler and F1 hybrids. A small number of Ler-specific targets were detected
   and confirmed. Consistent with a cis-regulatory mechanism for
   establishing H3K27me3, differential targets showed allele-specific
   H3K27me3 in hybrids. Five Ler-specific targets showed the active mark
   H3K4me3 in Col and for this group, differential H3K27me3 enrichment
   accorded to expression variation. On the other hand, the majority of
   Ler-specific targets were not expressed in Col, Ler or 17 other
   accessions. Instead of H3K27me3, the antagonistic mark H3K9me2 and other
   heterochromatic features were observed at these loci in Col. These loci
   were frequently flanked by transposable elements, which were often
   missing in the Ler genome assembly.
   Conclusion: There is little variation in H3K27me3 occupancy within the
   species, although H3K27me3 targets were previously shown as
   overrepresented among differentially expressed genes. The existing
   variation in H3K27me3 seems mostly explained by flanking polymorphic
   transposable elements. These could nucleate heterochromatin, which then
   spreads into neighboring H3K27me3 genes, thus converting them to H3K9me2
   targets.

TI Differential DNA methylation in discrete developmental stages of the
   parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: DNA methylation plays an essential role in regulating gene
   expression under a variety of conditions and it has therefore been
   hypothesized to underlie the transitions between life cycle stages in
   parasitic nematodes. So far, however, 5'-cytosine methylation has not
   been detected during any developmental stage of the nematode
   Caenorhabditis elegans. Given the new availability of high-resolution
   methylation detection methods, an investigation of life cycle
   methylation in a parasitic nematode can now be carried out.
   Results: Here, using MethylC-seq, we present the first study to confirm
   the existence of DNA methylation in the parasitic nematode Trichinella
   spiralis, and we characterize the methylomes of the three life-cycle
   stages of this food-borne infectious human pathogen. We observe a
   drastic increase in DNA methylation during the transition from the new
   born to mature stage, and we further identify parasitism-related genes
   that show changes in DNA methylation status between life cycle stages.
   Conclusions: Our data contribute to the understanding of the
   developmental changes that occur in an important human parasite, and
   raises the possibility that targeting DNA methylation processes may be a
   useful strategy in developing therapeutics to impede infection. In
   addition, our conclusion that DNA methylation is a mechanism for life
   cycle transition in T. spiralis prompts the question of whether this may
   also be the case in any other metazoans. Finally, our work constitutes
   the first report, to our knowledge, of DNA methylation in a nematode,
   prompting a re-evaluation of phyla in which this epigenetic mark was
   thought to be absent.

TI The mouse DXZ4 homolog retains Ctcf binding and proximity to Pls3
   despite substantial organizational differences compared to the primate
   macrosatellite
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: The X-linked macrosatellite DXZ4 is a large homogenous
   tandem repeat that in females adopts an alternative chromatin
   organization on the primate X chromosome in response to X-chromosome
   inactivation. It is packaged into heterochromatin on the active X
   chromosome but into euchromatin and bound by the epigenetic organizer
   protein CTCF on the inactive X chromosome. Because its DNA sequence
   diverges rapidly beyond the New World monkeys, the existence of DXZ4
   outside the primate lineage is unknown.
   Results: Here we extend our comparative genome analysis and report the
   identification and characterization of the mouse homolog of the
   macrosatellite. Furthermore, we provide evidence of DXZ4 in a conserved
   location downstream of the PLS3 gene in a diverse group of mammals, and
   reveal that DNA sequence conservation is restricted to the CTCF binding
   motif, supporting a central role for this protein at this locus.
   However, many features that characterize primate DXZ4 differ in mouse,
   including the overall size of the array, the mode of transcription, the
   chromatin organization and conservation between adjacent repeat units of
   DNA sequence and length. Ctcf binds Dxz4 but is not exclusive to the
   inactive X chromosome, as evidenced by association in some males and
   equal binding to both X chromosomes in trophoblast stem cells.
   Conclusions: Characterization of Dxz4 reveals substantial differences in
   the organization of DNA sequence, chromatin packaging, and the mode of
   transcription, so the potential roles performed by this sequence in
   mouse have probably diverged from those on the primate X chromosome.

TI Association between Genetic Instability and Helicobacter pylori
   Infection in Gastric Epithelial Dysplasia
SO GASTROENTEROLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB Background. In gastric carcinogenesis, changes of DNA methylation appear
   to be an early molecular event, and the genome-wide methylation state is
   closely correlated with the level of long interspersed nucleotide
   element-1 (LINE-1) methylation. In this study, we measured LINE-1
   methylation level according to genetic instability and evaluated the
   effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on genetic instability in
   gastric epithelial dysplasia. Methods. Total 100 tissue samples of
   gastric epithelial dysplasia were analyzed. Seven loci that linked to
   tumor suppressor genes were used to identify significant structural
   chromosomal aberrations. Microsatellite status was investigated for two
   different microsatellite marker loci (BAT25 and BAT26). Also, we
   measured LINE-1 methylation level by combined bisulfite restriction
   analysis (COBRA-LINE-1) method. Results. There were no significant
   differences of LINE-1 methylation level according to
   chromosomal/microsatellite instability and H. pylori state. In the
   dysplastic lesions with H. pylori infection, LINE-1 methylation level of
   MSI lesion was significantly lower than that of microsatellite stable
   (MSS) lesion (40.23 +/- 4.47 versus 43.90 +/- 4.81%, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions. In gastric epithelial dysplasia with H. pylori infection,
   MSI is correlated with reduced LINE-1 methylation level. Coexistence of
   H. pylori infection and MSI might be a driving force of gastric
   carcinogenesis.

TI H2A.Z landscapes and dual modifications in pluripotent and multipotent
   stem cells underlie complex genome regulatory functions
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: The histone variant H2A.Z has been implicated in nucleosome
   exchange, transcriptional activation and Polycomb repression. However,
   the relationships among these seemingly disparate functions remain
   obscure.
   Results: We mapped H2A.Z genome-wide in mammalian ES cells and neural
   progenitors. H2A.Z is deposited promiscuously at promoters and
   enhancers, and correlates strongly with H3K4 methylation. Accordingly,
   H2A.Z is present at poised promoters with bivalent chromatin and at
   active promoters with H3K4 methylation, but is absent from stably
   repressed promoters that are specifically enriched for H3K27
   trimethylation. We also characterized post-translational modification
   states of H2A.Z, including a novel species dually-modified by
   ubiquitination and acetylation that is enriched at bivalent chromatin.
   Conclusions: Our findings associate H2A.Z with functionally distinct
   genomic elements, and suggest that post-translational modifications may
   reconcile its contrasting locations and roles.

TI Epigenetic interplay between mouse endogenous retroviruses and host
   genes
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Transposable elements are often the targets of repressive
   epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation that, in theory, have
   the potential to spread toward nearby genes and induce epigenetic
   silencing. To better understand the role of DNA methylation in the
   relationship between transposable elements and genes, we assessed the
   methylation state of mouse endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) located near
   genes.
   Results: We found that ERVs of the ETn/MusD family show decreased DNA
   methylation when near transcription start sites in tissues where the
   nearby gene is expressed. ERVs belonging to the IAP family, however, are
   generally heavily methylated, regardless of the genomic environment and
   the tissue studied. Furthermore, we found full-length ETn and IAP copies
   that display differential DNA methylation between their two long
   terminal repeats (LTRs), suggesting that the environment surrounding
   gene promoters can prevent methylation of the nearby LTR. Spreading from
   methylated ERV copies to nearby genes was rarely observed, with the
   regions between the ERVs and genes apparently acting as a boundary,
   enriched in H3K4me3 and CTCF, which possibly protects the unmethylated
   gene promoter. Furthermore, the flanking regions of unmethylated ERV
   copies harbor H3K4me3, consistent with spreading of euchromatin from the
   host gene toward ERV insertions.
   Conclusions: We have shown that spreading of DNA methylation from ERV
   copies toward active gene promoters is rare. We provide evidence that
   genes can be protected from ERV-induced heterochromatin spreading by
   either blocking the invasion of repressive marks or by spreading
   euchromatin toward the ERV copy.

TI Developmental Epigenetics of the Murine Secondary Palate
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Orofacial clefts occur with a frequency of 1 to 2 per 1000 live births.
   Cleft palate, which accounts for 30% of orofacial clefts, is caused by
   the failure of the secondary palatal processes-medially directed, oral
   projections of the paired embryonic maxillary processes-to fuse. Both
   gene mutations and environmental effects contribute to the complex
   etiology of this disorder. Although much progress has been made in
   identifying genes whose mutations are associated with cleft palate,
   little is known about the mechanisms by which the environment adversely
   influences gene expression during secondary palate development. An
   increasing body of evidence, however, implicates epigenetic processes as
   playing a role in adversely influencing orofacial development.
   Epigenetics refers to inherited changes in phenotype or gene expression
   caused by processes other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence.
   Such processes include, but are not limited to, DNA methylation,
   microRNA effects, and histone modifications that alter chromatin
   conformation. In this review, we describe our current understanding of
   the possible role epigenetics may play during development of the
   secondary palate. Specifically, we present the salient features of the
   embryonic palatal methylome and profile the expression of numerous
   microRNAs that regulate protein-encoding genes crucial to normal
   orofacial ontogeny.

TI The Human Imprintome: Regulatory Mechanisms, Methods of Ascertainment,
   and Roles in Disease Susceptibility
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Imprinted genes form a special subset of the genome, exhibiting
   monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent fashion. This
   monoallelic expression is controlled by parental-specific epigenetic
   marks, which are established in gametogenesis and early embryonic
   development and are persistent in all somatic cells throughout life. We
   define this specific set of cis-acting epigenetic regulatory elements as
   the imprintome, a distinct and specially tasked subset of the epigenome.
   Imprintome elements contain DNA methylation and histone modifications
   that regulate monoallelic expression by affecting promoter
   accessibility, chromatin structure, and chromatin configuration.
   Understanding their regulation is critical because a significant
   proportion of human imprinted genes are implicated in complex diseases.
   Significant species variation in the repertoire of imprinted genes and
   their epigenetic regulation, however, will not allow model organisms
   solely to be used for this crucial purpose. Ultimately, only the human
   will suffice to accurately define the human imprintome.

TI Human genes with CpG island promoters have a distinct
   transcription-associated chromatin organization
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: More than 50% of human genes initiate transcription from CpG
   dinucleotide-rich regions referred to as CpG islands. These genes show
   differences in their patterns of transcription initiation, and have been
   reported to have higher levels of some activation-associated chromatin
   modifications.
   Results: Here we report that genes with CpG island promoters have a
   characteristic transcription-associated chromatin organization. This
   signature includes high levels of the transcription
   elongation-associated histone modifications H4K20me1, H2BK5me1 and
   H3K79me1/2/3 in the 5' end of the gene, depletion of the activation
   marks H2AK5ac, H3K14ac and H3K23ac immediately downstream of the
   transcription start site (TSS), and characteristic epigenetic
   asymmetries around the TSS. The chromosome organization factor CTCF may
   be bound upstream of RNA polymerase in most active CpG island promoters,
   and an unstable nucleosome at the TSS may be specifically marked by
   H4K20me3, the first example of such a modification. H3K36
   monomethylation is only detected as enriched in the bodies of active
   genes that have CpG island promoters. Finally, as expression levels
   increase, peak modification levels of the histone methylations H3K9me1,
   H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K27me1 shift further away from the TSS into the
   gene body.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that active genes with CpG island
   promoters have a distinct step-like series of modified nucleosomes after
   the TSS. The identity, positioning, shape and relative ordering of
   transcription-associated histone modifications differ between genes with
   and without CpG island promoters. This supports a model where chromatin
   organization reflects not only transcription activity but also the type
   of promoter in which transcription initiates.

TI Cancer Epigenetics: A Brief Review
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB Cancer is a disease that results from the successive accumulation of
   genetic and epigenetic alterations. Despite intense study, many
   unanswered questions about the nature of the contribution of epigenetic
   changes to carcinogenesis remain. In this review, we describe principles
   of epigenetics as they relate to our current understanding of
   carcinogenesis. There are a number of in vivo models of specific
   pathways of carcinogenesis that are very useful for the characterization
   of epigenetic mechanisms that link environmental exposures or genetic
   susceptibility and cancer progression. Because epigenetic alterations
   are thought to be reversible, they offer great promise for treatment of
   cancer. The use of animal models to evaluate the effects of decitabine
   and zebularine has elucidated the mechanisms of action and indicated the
   potential for these types of treatment. Ultimately, the greatest
   challenge lies in the integration of laboratory and epidemiologic data
   to best prevent and treat this deadly disease.

TI Functional analysis of transcription factor binding sites in human
   promoters
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: The binding of transcription factors to specific locations
   in the genome is integral to the orchestration of transcriptional
   regulation in cells. To characterize transcription factor binding site
   function on a large scale, we predicted and mutagenized 455 binding
   sites in human promoters. We carried out functional tests on these sites
   in four different immortalized human cell lines using transient
   transfections with a luciferase reporter assay, primarily for the
   transcription factors CTCF, GABP, GATA2, E2F, STAT, and YY1.
   Results: In each cell line, between 36% and 49% of binding sites made a
   functional contribution to the promoter activity; the overall rate for
   observing function in any of the cell lines was 70%. Transcription
   factor binding resulted in transcriptional repression in more than a
   third of functional sites. When compared with predicted binding sites
   whose function was not experimentally verified, the functional binding
   sites had higher conservation and were located closer to transcriptional
   start sites (TSSs). Among functional sites, repressive sites tended to
   be located further from TSSs than were activating sites. Our data
   provide significant insight into the functional characteristics of YY1
   binding sites, most notably the detection of distinct activating and
   repressing classes of YY1 binding sites. Repressing sites were located
   closer to, and often overlapped with, translational start sites and
   presented a distinctive variation on the canonical YY1 binding motif.
   Conclusions: The genomic properties that we found to associate with
   functional TF binding sites on promoters - conservation, TSS proximity,
   motifs and their variations - point the way to improved accuracy in
   future TFBS predictions.

TI Classification of human genomic regions based on experimentally
   determined binding sites of more than 100 transcription-related factors
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Transcription factors function by binding different classes
   of regulatory elements. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)
   project has recently produced binding data for more than 100
   transcription factors from about 500 ChIP-seq experiments in multiple
   cell types. While this large amount of data creates a valuable resource,
   it is nonetheless overwhelmingly complex and simultaneously incomplete
   since it covers only a small fraction of all human transcription
   factors.
   Results: As part of the consortium effort in providing a concise
   abstraction of the data for facilitating various types of downstream
   analyses, we constructed statistical models that capture the genomic
   features of three paired types of regions by machine-learning methods:
   firstly, regions with active or inactive binding; secondly, those with
   extremely high or low degrees of co-binding, termed HOT and LOT regions;
   and finally, regulatory modules proximal or distal to genes. From the
   distal regulatory modules, we developed computational pipelines to
   identify potential enhancers, many of which were validated
   experimentally. We further associated the predicted enhancers with
   potential target transcripts and the transcription factors involved. For
   HOT regions, we found a significant fraction of transcription factor
   binding without clear sequence motifs and showed that this observation
   could be related to strong DNA accessibility of these regions.
   Conclusions: Overall, the three pairs of regions exhibit intricate
   differences in chromosomal locations, chromatin features, factors that
   bind them, and cell-type specificity. Our machine learning approach
   enables us to identify features potentially general to all transcription
   factors, including those not included in the data.
